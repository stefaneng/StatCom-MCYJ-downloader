INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325 License recommendation.\nSection (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the appropriate\nDescription licensing action consistent with facts contained in the foster home\nevaluation and any special evaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Special Evaluation was complete, but the findings of fact were\ninappropriate. Foster mother's boyfriend vaped marijuana in the\nhouse and gave vape remnants to youth's friend. Foster mother's\nboyfriend permitted youth to use marijuana in the garage. Foster\nhome was found in full compliance.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nChief Administrator - On 7/14/2023 a meeting was held with\nChief Administrator via Microsoft Teams to discuss the\nallegations. During the meeting, Chief Administrator’s questions\nabout the investigation process were answered. Chief\nAdministrator was also provided clarification that licensing staff\ncan find non-compliance with licensing rules despite DHHS staff\ninvestigations resulting in no findings as the different workers are\ninvestigating different allegations such as abuse/neglect vs.\nlicensing rules. He expressed concern that doing so made the\nagency appear too harsh.\nLicensing Worker - On 7/14/2023 an interview of Licensing\nWorker was completed via Microsoft Teams. Licensing Worker\nreported Foster Parent 2 never stated he allowed the youth to\nsmoke marijuana in the garage. When he was asked the question\ndirectly, he responded that the youth was not allowed to smoke in\nthe house, rather he had to go outside or elsewhere. Licensing\nWorker stated it does not appear in the report that Foster Parent 2\nwas asked specifically about allowing the youth to smoke in the\ngarage or that he denied doing so. Licensing Worker reported,\nwhen interviewed by Licensing Worker, Adoption Worker stated\nFoster Parent 1 allowed the youth to smoke marijuana in the\ngarage; however, Licensing Worker believes this statement was\nmade after the incident being investigated occurred and Adoption\nWorker knew the youth had smoked in the garage. Licensing\nWorker stated she believes the foster parents are not in violation\nof rule 400.9201(1)(j) because they were utilizing the tools they\n2",
    "were given and following foster care’s guidance regarding the\nyouth’s marijuana use; however, foster care’s guidance to the\nfamily is not documented in the report.\nLicensing Worker reported the three youths who reported Foster\nParent 2 provided them with marijuana all provided different\nstories. One youth stated all three youths were allowed to use\nFoster Parent 2’s marijuana pen, one youth stated Foster Parent 2\ngave him a marijuana cartridge to use in his own pen, and one\nyouth stated Foster Parent 2 did not allow any of the youths to use\nthe pen or cartridge. Licensing Worker stated she did not ask\nFoster Parent 2 about the cartridge allegation and only asked two\nof the boys specifically about the cartridge since the stories of the\nthree youths did not match. She reported one of the youths later\nstated he had lied about using Foster Parent 2’s cartridge;\nhowever, that information was not included in the report.\nLicensing Supervisor - On 7/14/2023 an interview of Licensing\nSupervisor was completed via Microsoft Teams. Licensing\nSupervisor reported she believes Foster Parent 2 was including\nthe home’s garage when he stated he did not allow youth to\nsmoke in the home as the garage is attached to the home, which\nis why that information wasn’t included in the report. She also\nbelieves when Adoption Worker stated Foster Parent 1 allowed\nthe youth to smoke in the garage, she meant the youth had\nsmoked in the garage and Foster Parent 1 was aware it happened\nafter the fact. Licensing Supervisor reported the word “allowed”\nwas likely used incorrectly and could have been further assessed.\nLicensing Supervisor stated she believes the foster parents are\nnot in violation of rule 400.9201(1)(j) because they were doing the\nbest they could with a difficult youth with substance abuse\nconcerns. She reported the foster parents were following guidance\ngiven to them by the foster care worker and did demonstrate\nresponsible character, suitability, and ability to meet the needs of\nchildren and provide for their care, supervision, and protection.\nLicensing Supervisor stated that the guidance given by foster care\nwas not included in the report because she did not know that\ndetails of a youth’s treatment plan could be included.\nLicensing Supervisor reported the allegations made by the youths\nregarding Foster Parent 2 providing them with a marijuana pen or\ncartridge were not consistent which is why it was not assessed\nfurther.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n3",
    "Special Evaluation Report 2023C0000425 completed by Licensing\nWorker and approved by Licensing Supervisor, which documented\nthe following:\n• Foster Parent 1 stated that Youth A is a teenager, and he\nwill use marijuana if he wants to so she asked that he not\nuse marijuana in her home. Foster Parent 1 stated he could\ngo for a walk, be outside or somewhere else but not in her\nhome while using marijuana.\n• Foster Parent 2 stated when all of the boys were in the\nhouse, he had talked to them about not smoking in the\nhome and would appreciate if they would smoke outside.\nFoster Parent 2 stated the next morning the garage smelled\nlike marijuana.\n• Youth B stated that Foster Parent 2 talked to the boys and\nsaid, \"Foster Parent 1 doesn't like smoking in the house so\ndo it in the garage.\"\n• Youth A stated he was asked not to use marijuana but was\ntold he could smoke marijuana in the garage. Youth A\nstated Foster Parent 2 knows Foster Parent 1 doesn't want\nmarijuana in the house and allowed Youth A to smoke in\nthe garage.\n• Adoption Worker stated Foster Parent 1 had mentioned\nYouth A not being allowed to smoke marijuana in the house\nbut has allowed him to smoke marijuana in the garage.\n• Youth A stated Foster Parent 1 provide all 3 boys a\nmarijuana pen when they were in the basement.\n• Youth B stated Foster Parent 2 allowed Youth B to have\nwhat was left in the cartridge that clicks into the marijuana\npen.\n• Youth C stated he saw Foster Parent 2 in the basement\nwith a marijuana pen that he was consistently hitting.\nYouth C said Foster Parent 2 wouldn't give the youths the\nmarijuana pen.\n• Foster Parent 2 stated he did not give any of the children in\nthe home a marijuana pen. Foster Parent 2 stated he has not\nused a nicotine pen or marijuana pen in over a year.\n• Based on the interviews on 3/9/2023, 3/21/2023, and\n4/4/2023 and the report written by a DHHS worker, Foster\nParent 1 & Foster Parent 2 are not in violation of Rule\n400.9201(1)(j). Foster Parent 2 reported each incident in a\ntimely manner to foster care and intervened in the ways\nthat were recommended by foster care. The DHHS worker\nrecommended substantiation for Foster Parent 2’s\ninvolvement in the allegations based on the disclosures\n4",
    "from the children in the home. The DHHS supervisor\ndenied substantiation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in violation as the facts contained in the\nspecial evaluation report do not support the findings. The report\ndocuments allegations by youths and the family’s adoption worker\nthat the foster parents allowed the youths to smoke marijuana in\nthe garage. There is no documentation that the foster parents\ndenied this allegation; however, the family was found in\ncompliance. The foster parents reported they told the youths if\nthey were going to smoke marijuana, to not do it in the home.\nThere is no documentation that the foster parents discouraged\nmarijuana use by the youths. Additionally, one youth alleged that\nFoster Parent 2 provided him with a marijuana cartridge; however,\nthere is no documentation that anyone denied this allegation.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327 Special evaluation.\nSection (1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in the\nDescription agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(c) Conduct a thorough investigation including all necessary\ncollateral contacts.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation During the investigation an allegation was made that Caregiver 2\nwas smoking/vaping in the home which was not assessed.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nLicensing Worker - On 7/14/2023 an interview of Licensing\nWorker was completed via Microsoft Teams. Licensing Worker\nreported rule 400.9310(1) was not assessed in the report as an\nadditional allegation because there no evidence that Foster Parent\n2 smoked/vaped, despite allegation made by youths that they saw\nhim hitting a marijuana pen. Licensing Worker stated Foster\nParent 2 submitted to a drug screen for which he tested negative\nfor marijuana; however, that was not documented in the report.\nShe stated she did ask all youth residing in the home if they had\nseen anyone smoke in the home; however, that was not\ndocumented in the report.\nLicensing Supervisor - On 7/14/2023 an interview of Licensing\nSupervisor was completed via Microsoft Teams. Licensing\nSupervisor reported rule 400.9310(1) was not included in the\nreport as an additional allegation. She reported she did not even\nthink about adding this as an allegation since she knew that no\none in the home smoked due to previous interaction with the\n5",
    "foster family, but she understands this should have been\nassessed and included.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nSpecial Evaluation Report 2023C0000425 completed by Licensing\nWorker and approved by Licensing Supervisor, which documented\nthe following:\n• Youth C stated he saw Foster Parent 2 in the basement with a\nmarijuana pen that he was consistently hitting.\nAnalysis The agency is found in violation due to an additional allegation\nmade during the course of the special evaluation not being\ninvestigated or documented.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & 722.120 Investigation, inspection, and examination of\nSection conditions, books, records, and reports; access by\nDescription department, bureau of fire services, or local authorities;\nrecords; report; forms; confidentiality; disclosure of\ninformation; availability of confidential records; child\ninformation cards to be provided to department; failure of\nlicensee to cooperate with investigation, inspection, or\nexamination.\nSec. 10.\n(3) A licensee shall keep the records the department prescribes\nregarding each child in its control and care and shall report to the\ndepartment, if requested, the facts the department requires with\nreference to the children upon forms furnished by the department.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection\n(4), records regarding children and facts compiled about children\nand their parents and relatives are confidential and disclosure of\nthis information must be properly safeguarded by the childcare\norganization, the department, and any other entity in possession of\nthe information.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Confidential information appears in the special evaluation report.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nLicensing Worker - On 7/14/2023 an interview of Licensing\nWorker was completed via Microsoft Teams. Licensing Worker\nreported she was supposed to remove the confidential information\n6",
    "during edits; however, she submitted the final report without\nmaking that edit.\nLicensing Supervisor - On 7/14/2023 an interview of Licensing\nSupervisor was completed via Microsoft Teams.
