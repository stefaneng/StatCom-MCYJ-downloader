Youth D tried to hit Staff 1 during the altercation, but\nStaff 1 put his hands up and walked away.

Staff 1 then took both arms, wrapped\nthem around Youth A and pushed her toward the wall. Staff 1 then\nattempted to restrain Youth A in a Team Control Position.

After additional\nstaff stepped in to assist, Staff 1 did not promptly remove himself\nfrom the situation, further agitating Youth A and Youth D.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2024C0001153SI dated 3/25/24, CAP approved 4/22/24.\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a youth\non any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff pushed youth.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 11/25/24 Youth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker.
