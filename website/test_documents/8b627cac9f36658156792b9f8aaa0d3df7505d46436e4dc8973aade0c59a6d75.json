EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were two incidents of substantiated maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe first incident related to a 9/14/2022 foster home complaint alleging the children\nare denied meals; the foster children are told by the foster parent she has to be nice\nto them to receive her money; a foster child’s mattress was placed on the floor;\nanother child is body shamed for body order/not using deodorant; and the children\nare physically disciplined with a stick or wooden spoon. During the course of the\ninvestigation the foster mother admitted to hitting one child hard with a belt for\nurinating in the sink; and the children reported being physically disciplined.\nAdditionally, the evidence showed the foster mother’s daughter had threatened to\nhit one of the foster children with a wooden spoon; and the children had been\ndenied meals on occasion. The foster home was found in willful substantial\nnoncompliance of the foster home behavior management rule, foster home\napplicant qualification rules, and food and nutrition rule. The children were replaced\nfrom the foster home; and revocation of the foster home’s license was\nrecommended by the agency.\nThe second incident related to a 1/11/2023 foster home complaint alleging sexual\nmaltreatment by one of the foster parents. The foster home was found in willful\nsubstantial noncompliance of the licensed foster home applicant qualification rules.\nThe children were replaced from the home; and revocation of the foster home’s\nlicense was recommended by the agency.\nDue to CWLM issues the routing and completion of both of these special\ninvestigation reports in the system was stalled, the respective special evaluation\nreport was finished/approved outside the system. The agency’s handling of these\nspecial investigations appeared appropriate. The agency adhered to all\ndepartmental standard except R400.12327(6)(b)(c) for both special evaluations, and\nACT 116-722.120(3) related to the former incident, each of which is cited in this\nInspection report.",
    "There were two incidents of corporal discipline during this licensing period.\nThe first incident related to a 4/19/2022 foster home complaint alleging the foster\nfather whupped/spanked a foster child. During the course of the investigation the\nfoster children acknowledged being physically disciplined with an orange\nobject/shoehorn; and the foster parent admitted to using physical discipline. The\nfoster home was found in violation of the foster home behavior management rule. A\ncorrective action plan was developed with the foster parent. The corrective action\nplan involved a safety plan, re-review of the agency’s discipline policy and foster\nparent /agency agreement, and agreement by the foster parent to adhere to all of\nthese.\nThe second incident related to a 6/14/2022 foster home complaint alleging the\nfoster daughter was slapped by the foster father; that the foster father was upset\nwith the child and grabbed a belt and hit the child with it. During the course of the\ninvestigation the child and the foster father admitted the foster father lightly popped\nthe child on the arm. The foster father reported doing so and advising the child to\nreturn to her room. The agency found the foster home in violation of the foster\nhome behavior management rule, and a corrective action plan was developed with\nthe foster parent. The corrective action involved training, a re-review of the\nagency’s’ discipline policy and foster parent /agency agreement and agreement by\nthe foster parent to adhere to all of these.\nThe agency handling of these special investigations appeared appropriate. The\nagency adhered all departmental standards except R400.12327(6)(a)(b)(c);\nR400.12327(7) for both special evaluations, and ACT 116-722.120(3) related to the\nlatter special evaluation, each of which is cited in this Inspection report.\nThe agency submitted five acceptable corrective action plans during this\nreporting period.\nThe first corrective action plan was related to the agency’s 2022 Renewal inspection\nwhere it received the following rule violations:\n• R400.12212(2)(e)(i)(ii) Personnel records.\n• R400.12212(2)(h) Personnel records.\n• R400.12311(2) (e) Foster parent/agency agreement.\n• R400.12324 (8) Reevaluation.\n• R400.12405(5)(a)(b) Change of placement.\n• R400.12413(1)(c) (i) Medical and dental care policy.\n• R400.12413(1)(d) Medical and dental policy.\n• R400.12418(2) (b) Development of service plans.\n• ISEP MISACWIS (Commitment 22).\n• ISEP 6.30 Supervisory Oversight (Commitment 66).\n• ISEP 6.33 Assessments and Service Plans.\n• ISEP 6.49 Medical Passports (Commitment 85).\n• FOM 722-6B Family Team Meeting.",
    "• FOM 722-6H Documentation of Contacts.\n• FOM 722-8 Foster Care-Initial Service Plan- Supervisory Approval.\n• ADM 300 Child Adoption Assessment Addendum.\n• ADM 330 Quarterly progress reports.\nThe agency made some progress with some aspects of this corrective action plan\nas illustrated during the records’ review and staff interviews. However, the agency\nhad 17 total violations during their 2022 inspection and 25 citations during this\ninspection, 12 of which are repeat violations. In addition, the special investigation\nnoted below that led to the first provisional license is a repeat violation.\nThe second corrective action plan related to special investigation 2022C0201003\nregarding a complaint received on 1/3/2022. The complaint alleged that the\nagency did not provide a response on a case emergency from 12/27/2021 –\n12/29/2021. During the special investigation the evidence revealed the agency had\nan emergency system in place, but a faulty telephone system, which the agency\nwas aware of before the holiday season, preventing them from addressing the\nemergency that arose. The agency was found in violation of R400.12403(2)(f) for\nPolicy and procedures related to unusual incidents. The agency submitted an\nacceptable corrective action plan in March of 2022 that indicated the telephone\nanswering system had been repaired by the vendor, the answering message\nsystem had been programmed to provide instructions to callers on how to contact a\nsupervisor in case of an emergency, and staff were made aware of the process.\nThis corrective action plan has been completed.\nThe third corrective action plan related to special investigation 2022C0420008\nregarding a complaint received on 1/21/2022 alleging financial instability for the\nagency. The agency was ultimately found in violation of R400.12202(a) for Policy\nand procedures related to financial instability in October 2022. A recommendation\noccurred was made to Modify the agency’s license to a first provisional license. The\nagency submitted an acceptable corrective plan in March 2023. The corrective\naction plan was approved in April 2023; and the agency was placed on a first\nprovisional license. The agency has made progress with various aspects of this\ncorrective action plan. This includes establishment of a finance committee so as to\nprovide financial recommendations to the board; establishment of a contract with\nADP for payroll, provider payments, so as to ensure for timely payments to staff and\ncaregivers; hiring of a new independent accounting firm (GJC); all of these action\nsteps have been verified. Additionally, the agency has settlement agreements with\nthe state related to three overpayment issues. Documentation showing the\nagency’s pay off of one of these overpayment issues, and payments on the other\ntwo overpayment issues, as agreed, was verified. The agency also has a payment\ninstallment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to an old\ndebt. Payments to the IRS were to commence on 7/28/2023, via direct bank\nwithdrawal payments by the IRS. The IRS did not initiate these payments as they\nhad indicated. In October 2023 the agency initiated them. The agency provided\nproof of that, and that it made the next higher payment amount as required by the\nIRS in November and December 2023. As for an arrangement with the Department",
    "related to another old debt for 2014 and 2015 payment advancements this remains\npending. With regards to the agency’s current financial standing, the agency\nreported some gains.

The agency was found in violation of R400.1214 for\ncompliance with the child protection law. The agency submitted an acceptable\ncorrective plan in April 2023. This corrective action plan involved creation of an\nemergency mandatory reporting protocol policy and indicated the policy would be\nadhered to by workers during personal emergencies, and agency leaves; that\nnotification of the new policy would occur to all foster and adoptive families, and all\nstaff; and the policy would be discussed at unit staff meetings.

The agency had asked for and\nreceived an extension from the state for submission of the independent financial",
    "audit. The audit noted that the factors indicated raise substantial doubt about the\nagency’s ability to continue. Additionally, it indicated the agency has created a new\nfinance committee, as well as a funds development committee to come up with\nstrategies to eliminate the agency’s debt. Additionally, that the agency is increasing\nits service capacity through its foster care program to increase revenue. That with\nthese additional measures in place the agency plans to eliminate its debt and\ngenerate revenue.\nThe agency continues to have a substantial debt and will require additional time to\nshow they can meet all of their financial responsibilities.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to speaking with the chief administrator and licensing and adoption\nmanager who serves as the agency’s licensee designee, I also spoke with the foster\ncare supervisor and licensing worker. I also interviewed a foster care/adoption\nworker; an adoption worker and three adoptive parents.\nWith the exception of one parent expressing concern related to the agency\ntechnology being antiquated, and the worker not always apprising them of the\nstatus of the adoption; positive regards were reported for the agency by the other\nadoptive parents and by the employees.\nThe agency does not have youths in independent living, so no youths were required\nto be interviewed.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA tour of the agency's offices and records’ storage was conducted; no safety issues\nor other concerns were observed.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency had one safety alerts this inspection.\nConcern:\nOn 6/12/2023 phone contact was attempted with the relative caregiver by the\nDivision of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL) Analyst. After phone and text messages\nto the caregiver, which continued to 6/21/2023, did not result in a return contact from\nthe caregiver for a home visit, a safety alert was completed. The agency was\nadvised to make a home visit to the caregiver’s residence to verify the wellbeing of\nthe child and the safety of the home.\nResolution:\nThe agency completed a home visit on 6/26/2023. The worker observed the child,\nverified the child’s well-being and conducted a tour of the home. A working smoke\nalarm and carbon monoxide detector were observed, along with no observable\nhealth, sanitation or safety hazards. The home had accessible egress windows, no\nfire arms, running water; and medication and cleaning supplies were properly",
    "stored. The agency provided photos of the fire alarm, carbon monoxide detector,\nwindows, and rooms of the home.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. The agency has also not achieved enough significant\nprogress on its financial instablity which stemmed the special investigation’s\n(2022C0420008) corrective action that resulted in adverse action placing the agency\non a provision license. Due to these findings, the department recommends that the\nagency’s license be modified to a second provisional license.\nJanuary 16, 2024\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 18, 2024\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
