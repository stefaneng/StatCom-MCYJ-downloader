He reported staff is supposed to do pocket\nchecks when a youth returns to the facility after an outing. Youth B\nreported the next day Youth A reported not feeling well, so Youth\nB told Staff 2 about the alcohol they drank because he was\nconcerned about Youth A. He reported when youth go on outings\nto a store they need to stay in the eyesight of staff and he reported\nStaff 1 did a decent job, they were just sneaky.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nFebruary 23, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker.\nYouth C reported on February 19, 2023, he went to Meijer with\nYouth A, Youth B, and Staff 1. He reported while walking through\nthe store at one point the youth split up a little bit while Staff 1 was\nwalking behind them. Youth C reported he ran around the corner\nand grabbed a fifth of alcohol and hid it in his jacket. He reported\nStaff 1 then redirected the youth to stay together and asked Youth\nC specifically if he had anything. Youth C told Staff 1 no and then\nasked to use the bathroom. Staff 1 allowed Youth C to use the\nbathroom since it was in visual sight of where the other youth\nwere. Youth C reported he brought the bottle into the bathroom\nand then told the other youth it was in there when he left. He\nreported the other two youth then used the bathroom and drank\nfrom the bottle. Youth C reported at that time Staff 1 was outside\nthe bathroom when the drinking occurred. When the three youth\nwere heading to the checkout lines to buy their approved drinks,\nthey stole a couple of the mini shot bottles of alcohol that was\nupfront by the checkout line. Youth C reported at that time Staff 1\nwas walking behind the youth as they were heading to the\ncheckout line and did not see them. He reported when they went\ninto the van, Youth A and Youth B put the mini shot bottles of\nalcohol into the energy drinks they bought. Youth C reported Staff\n1 was driving during the time this was occurring and reported he\ndoes not believe Staff 1 knew what was going on. He reported the\nonly way Staff 1 might have known was because Youth B was\ntalking about alcohol in the car. Youth C reported Staff 1 took\nthem to McDonald’s because Staff 1 wanted a drink, and another\nyouth got french fries. There were no reports of Staff 1 taking the\nyouth to McDonald’s to help cover up the alcohol. Youth C\nreported Staff 1 does a good job at supervision and the three\nyouth were just sneaky. He reported he would have done the\n4",
    "same thing with any other staff because he just wanted to get a bit\nof a buzz from alcohol.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 1,\n2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported on\nFebruary 19, 2023, he took Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C to\nMeijer after picking up Youth A from a home visit.

Staff 1 admitted the youth were further away than they\nshould have been, and he did not have full supervision of the\nyouth. He reported when he caught up to Youth C, he was in the\nalcohol aisle and told him to get out of there and asked him if he\nhad anything. Staff 1 reported Youth C told him he didn’t have\nanything and then he asked where the other two youth were.\nYouth A and Youth B were over by the soft drink aisle. Once the\nyouth picked out their drinks, Youth B asked Staff 1 if they could\nlook at the electronics. When at the electronics area, Youth A\nasked to use the bathroom which Staff 1 allowed since it was in\neyesight. Staff 1 reported he had a conversation with Youth C\nabout tv shows and video games. When Staff 1 looked up from\nthat conversation, he noticed Youth B was gone and went to\nsearch the bathroom. When he arrived in the bathroom, Youth A\nwas walking out of the bathroom stale and Youth B was walking\ninto one. Staff 1 reported he was concerned that Youth A and\nYouth B were in the bathroom alone because there have been\nrumors that those two youth are in a relationship and concerned,\nthey were being sexually inappropriate with one another. When\nasked what the bathroom policy is on community outings, Staff 1\nreported if there is one youth needing to go then they can go while\nthe area remains in the eyesight of staff. If two youth need to go\nand it is a bathroom with multiple stalls, staff are supposed to go\nin so there are no concerns within the bathroom. Staff 1 denied\never seeing Youth C go into the bathroom. After the youths were\ndone with the bathroom, they headed back to the vehicle and\nYouth A asked to stop at McDonald’s for french fires. Staff 1\nstopped at McDonald’s drive-thru on the way back to the facility.\nStaff 1 reported he had no concerns about the alcohol use of the\nyouth. He believed he was being interviewed because of concerns\nabout Youth A and Youth B being in the bathroom alone with one\nanother and something sexually happening.

Staff 1 reported he had trust in the youth and cannot\n5",

Staff 1 reported he\ndid not complete pocket checks on Youth A, Youth B, or Youth C\nafter their outing to Meijer on February 19, 2023. He reported he\nknows that he was supposed to complete pocket checks of the\nyouth because they are not supposed to bring any items onto the\nunit without staff knowing. Staff 1 reported he did not complete\npocket checks because he made a promise to another unit to\nwatch an all-star game on TV with him and did not want to miss it.\nStaff 1 denied he was aware that Youth A had snuck mini bottles\nof alcohol into his bedroom from that outing.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on February\n23, 2023, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker.
