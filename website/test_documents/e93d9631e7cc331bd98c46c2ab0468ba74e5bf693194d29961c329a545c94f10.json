In addition, the CA noted the agency partners with two local DHHS offices\nand their CQI teams which has had a significant impact over the past few years. The\nCA indicated the agency has increased supervisor oversight partnered with\nadditional input from staff regarding data for key performance indicators. The CA\nexpressed confidence in the current systems in place.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff acknowledged the\nagency has struggled during the review period with staff turnover. However, they\nexpressed confidence that staff retention will improve. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by supervisors as well as their peers and did not report any needs at this\ntime.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\n6",
