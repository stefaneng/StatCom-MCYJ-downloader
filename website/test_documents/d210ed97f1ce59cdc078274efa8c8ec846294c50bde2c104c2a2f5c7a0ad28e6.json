EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two corrective action plans (CAP) during this period\nunder review.\nThe first corrective action plan related to Special Investigation 2023C000176,\nwhich alleged the agency placed a child with an adult who was not legally related\nto the child, nor a legal custodian or licensed foster parent. The agency was found\nin violation of CPA Rule 400.12404(1). The agency’s submitted an acceptable\ncorrective action plan on 4/25/2023. The agency has not experienced another",
    "situation similar to the one that lead to this special investigation. The agency\ncompleted all other aspects of this corrective action plan.\nThe second CAP related to the agency’s 2023 Interim inspection completed on\n5/23/2023 where the CAP was approved on 7/25/2023. The agency received 27\nviolations, 10 of which are repeat violations this year. The agency’s compliance\naround these 10 rule violations is as follows: with the exception of R400.12502(2)\nand R400.12503(3) where the number of individual cases cited increased from 2\nof 2 to 3 of 3; the other 8 repeat violations number of individual cases cited, either\ndecreased or stayed the same.\nIn the agency’s 2022 Renewal inspection, 33 violations were established, 10 of\nwhich were repeat violations this year.

Its number of rule violations this\ninspection stay the same from 2023 and decreased from 2022. The agency\ncompleted the various trainings indicated in its CAP. They also showed sample\nproofs of emails and calendar reminders, and discussions with staff related to\ntimeframes, key performance indicators, and CAP reviews. Notwithstanding the\nagency’s progress with the 2023 CAP, the agency received the repeat violations\nas cited in this report. The agency will need to develop further action steps and\ncontinue its efforts with staff to advance rule compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) provided a chief administrator’s assessment report\ndated 4/3/2024. The CA reported that since the majority of the staff have been in\ntheir roles for less than one year it has taken time to get them trained and\naccustomed to their roles. The CA also reported the last CAP assisted the agency\nin modifying their processes to improve compliance; that a foster care case aide\nhelped with sending reminder letters, calls and email to foster parent regarding\nmedicals/dentals and transportation. Additionally, a tracking system and reminders\nduring team meetings and individual supervisions has been used to improve the\ntimeliness of licensing, adoption and foster care reports and medicals and dentals.\nThe agency believes it has had compliance success with its quarterly CAP reviews\nby the supervisory team; and it plans to continue this process.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a 2024 agency budget and the 2022 end of the year\nindependent financial audit. No major concerns were observed.\nStaff Interviews\nIn additions to discussion with the chief administrator, program director,\nlicensing/adoption supervisor, and two foster care supervisors, I interviewed one\nfoster care worker, one adoption worker, one licensing worker, and one foster care\nsupervisor. The staff interviewed reported the smallness of the agency allows for",
    "a close-knit family environment where everyone is willing to help and there is a\nreliable team. The staff reported feeling appreciated and supported by the\nadministration. Areas of growth or improvement indicated was for more staff to be\nhired so as to reduce staff responsibilities, continued improved communication\namongst all departments, and increased organization of forms and case records.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility showed the agency has ample office space and\nequipment for its staff. Additionally, it showed case records were properly stored\nand secured. There were no safety concerns observed.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two safety alerts received.\nSafety Alert #1 received 3/13/2024:\nConcern:\nThe foster parent refused to allow the Analyst’s visit; and the safety of the child and\nthe home could not be assessed.\nResolution:\nWhen contacted by the agency, the foster parent admitted to not allowing the visit,\nby the Analyst. The foster parent reported not doing so, because she wanted to\nclose her license. The agency reported, the child in the home had been adopted by\nthe foster parent on 2/1/2024. Additionally, that it commenced a special evaluation\non the foster home related to this matter on 3/14/2024.
