CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• N/A - No consultation was requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. The agency currently has three pending investigations (2023C0000368,\n2023C0000529 and 2023C0000434) that include allegations that are being\ninvestigated collaboratively with DCWL and the MIC unit.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe review period for this report began March 11, 2023 until current. The agency\nwas granted a 1st Provisional License at that time. The facility had a total of six\nspecial investigations during this period under review with one resulting in\ncorrective action plan (CAP) and three that remain pending. The special\ninvestigation resulting in non-compliance was for the agency not provididng",
    "consistent therapy for youth as required. The corrective action plan included\nspecifc staff training on requirements of treatment goals of youth, and clinical\ndirector oversight of therapy being completed weekly. The agency also had one\ncorrective action plan as a result of their 2022 interim inspection. The non-\ncompliances included case file documentation and initial health screening\nrequirements. Monthly unannounced visits to the facility have been completed and\nimplementation of their corrective action plan has been noted.\nThe agency was placed on a 1st provisional license as a result of special\ninvestigation 2023C0137003. The agency was successful in implementing most of\nthe corrective action plan that was approved on March 13, 2023. They retrained\nall staff on supervision requirements, and religious/spiritual policy and practices, in\nMarch 2023. The five staff that were involved in the inappropriate restraint were\nsuspended and then terminated during the course of the investigation without the\nability to be rehired. The corrective action plan also included an action step for\nclinical staff retraining on the updated program statement, report writing and\ndissemination of information utilizing a communication flow chart. This was not yet\nimplemented as all the youth were moved out of Vassar House and staff were laid\noff or reassigned to another area in early April 2023. As the agency is currently\nwithout youth or staff, they have committed to implement the action steps when the\nagency hires staff and resumes providing direct care to youth at Vassar House.\nFinancial Overview\nA review of the financial documents for WHS - Vassar House were reviewed. No\nareas of concern were noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nThe last PREA audit for Vassar House was completed on March 3, 2021. The\nagency was found to be in compliance. Vassar House terminated their juvenile\njustice contract on May 5, 2023.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was completed and submitted for review. The\nassessment documented areas that the agency is looking to address via\nCorrective Action Plans. The assessment also indicated an appropriate plan for\ncontinued monitoring of compliance. The agency is currently without residents but\nis maintaining an open mind about demonstrating substantial compliance and\nreturning to meeting the needs of youth through the program.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nA total of three staff were interviewed as a part of the renewal inspection. No\nconcerns were noted, and the employees provided positive feedback regarding the\ncompany and the improvements that they believe the current administration is\nmaking. Those changes include, but are not limited to, adjustment in staff to youth\nratio, new CPI protocol and the use of compliance forms to document strengths\nand areas of improvement for the agency.",
    "No youth were interviewed as a part of this renewal. The facility is currently\nwithout any youth and the last youth was discharged on 4/4/2023.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency was completed. The facility was found to be in good\ncondition. Currently there are no youth residing at the facility, so it is secured and\nlocked to prevent unwanted entrance.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n08/23/2023\n____________________________________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n_________________ August 23, 2023___________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
