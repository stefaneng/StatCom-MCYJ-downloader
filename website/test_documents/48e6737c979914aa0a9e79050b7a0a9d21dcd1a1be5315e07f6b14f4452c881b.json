    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention; prohibited\nTitle restraints; elimination of restraints.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159\nSection (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nDescription manner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the\nseverity of the youth’s behavior, chronological and\ndevelopmental age, size, gender, physical condition, medical\ncondition, psychiatric\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A had to be restrained on 3/1/24 around 8:30pm. Youth A\nwas aggressive, kicking, throwing objects, and trying to bite staff.\nYouth A was seen by a nurse and reportedly did not have any\nbruises. On 3/2/24, Youth A was observed to have a bump on his\nforehead. The bruise was 1 inch in diameter.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI spoke to Foster Care Worker (FCW) on 3/4/24. FCW reported\nshe picked up Youth A for a home visit and he had a bump and\nbruise on his forehead. Youth A reported to her that an unknown\nstaff gave him the bump from a restraint.\nI spoke to Complainant 1 on 3/4/24. No new information was\nprovided.\nI spoke to Administrator 1 on 3/4/24. Allegations were discussed.\nAdministrator 1 reported Youth A was restrained on 3/1/24 and did\nsee the nurse.\nI spoke to DHHS Worker 1. Allegations were discussed and\nscheduling. No other information was discussed.\nThe following interviews were conducted with DHHS Worker 1 at\nthe facility on 3/8/24.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported he was hurt by a female staff on the right side of\nhis head. Youth A reported she threw a brush at his head. Youth A\nreported he was not hurt in a restraint but afterwards. Youth A no\nlonger wanted to discuss the situation, so he left the interview.\n2",
    "I reviewed the video due to the allegations not matching Youth\nA’s interview. On 3/1/24, at 7:05:16 pm, Youth A was in a child\ncontrol position, restrained. The restraint position was done in the\nmanner outlined in the Crisis Prevention Interventions. He was\nreleased from the restraint at 7:09:26 pm. As Youth A stood up, he\nstumbled, lost his balance, and hit his forehead on the right side of\nthe lower glass wall panel. Youth A then went into his bedroom. At\n7:17:11pm, Staff 1 went to the doorway of Youth A’s room and\nentered Youth A’s room at 7:17:42pm. At 7:18:45pm Staff 1 came\nout of his room. No one else was near the bedroom door or\nentrance of the door to see the events.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 reported she went into Youth A’s doorway after he was\nrestrained on 3/1/24. Youth A was upset, and Staff 1 was\nattempting to verbally deescalate him. Youth A threw lotion bottles\nand his brushes at Staff 1. Staff 1 reported she blocked the brush\nwith her arm and Youth A began yelling that Staff 1 hit him. Staff 1\nreported she wrote an incident report so it would be documented.\nStaff 1 reported if she did hit Youth A with a brush it was because\nshe deflected the brush with her arm when he threw it at her.\nStaff 1 reported she did not see him get hit with the brush but\nwanted to make sure it was documented because he was yelling\nthat she had done so. Staff 1 reported no one else was near the\nroom when she was deescalating Youth A.\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed the Incident Report written by Staff 1 on 3/1/24:\n“Resident threw an item at staff, staff attempted to block\nitem, item ricocheted off staff and hit the resident in the\nhead”.\n• I reviewed the Incident report for the restraint on 3/1/24.\nYouth A was aggressive in attacking unidentified staff and\nbreaking the glass fishtank. Incident report noted a child\ncontrol was applied and the nurse did see Youth A after the\nrestraint. The restraint documentation is in agreement with\nNurse Notes and video observation.\n• I reviewed the Nurse Notes for 3/1/24. “Child bumped his\nhead against the wall, has a quarter sized bump at right\nforehead, no broken skin or bruising, attempted to put ice\non forehead but Youth A refused.” **I observed on the\nvideo the Nurse entering Youth A’s room at 7:16:00pm.\nShe went into his room after he had hit his head on the wall\npanel and before Staff 1 entered his room.\n3",
    "• I reviewed the McLaren Oakland Emergency Department\nDischarge Form. Youth A was seen on 3/2/24. Final\ndiagnosis: “Minor head injury without LOC. There were no\nmedications prescribed.” If the condition worsened to see\nprimary physician.\nAnalysis Youth A reported he was not hurt in a restraint, but by a female\nstaff throwing a brush at him. Based on interviews, documents\ngathered, and video observation there is not enough evidence to\nsupport Staff 1 purposely hitting Youth A with a brush causing a\nbruise. Documentation and video observation support Youth A\nhurting himself when he hit his head against the wall panel.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n4/9/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
