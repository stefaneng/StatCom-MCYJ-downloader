    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Policy and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12703\nSection (1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures for the adoption services provided under R 400.12704\nto R 400.12713\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency accepted youth under safe delivery act and placed with\nadoption supervisor.\nInvestigation On 4/2/25 Complainant anonymously reported Adoption\nSupervisor accepted placement of a child under the Safe\nDelivery of Newborns Act. The act required placement by a Child\nPlacing Agency (CPA). Complainant reported that Adoption\nSupervisor was also the daughter of Chief Administrator.\nComplainant indicated there may be a violation of adoption\nplacement services, agency services, and safeguarding privacy.\nComplainant did not indicate if Adoption Supervisor had an\napproved adoption evaluation.\nInterviews\nOn 4/4/25 Complainant was interviewed by phone. Complainant\nstated that Safe Delivery of Newborns Act required the newborn to\nbe surrendered to an emergency service provider such as a\nhospital, police or fire station. The emergency provider would then\nsend the child to a CPA for placement, and the CPA places the\nbaby with an approved adoptive parent. Complainant stated they\nwere aware the agency was a licensed CPA. However, they were\nconcerned about an infant being placed with staff. Complainant\nindicated the court “frowned upon” placements like that.\nComplainant reported Adoption Supervisor had an approved\nadoption evaluation through a different CPA. However,\ncomplainant was unsure if Keane Center had a policy about\nplacing with employees or family members, or a policy regarding\nplacement with the longest waiting applicant. Complainant\nquestioned if the child’s needs were best served by this\nplacement. Complainant was also concerned about the agency\nsafeguarding the rights of the biological mother as the adoptive\nmother (Adoption Supervisor) and adoptive grandmother (Chief\nAdministrator) potentially had access to information about the\nbiological mother. Complainant clarified they did not have any\n2",
    "concerns about Adoption Supervisor, or her suitability as an\nadoptive parent. However, from the outside it looked as if there\nwas preferential treatment of family occurring at this agency.\nOn 4/8/24 Chief Administrator was interviewed by phone. Chief\nAdministrator confirmed an infant was placed with Adoption\nSupervisor through Safe Delivery of Newborns Act. The agency\ndid not have a policy regarding placements with staff or relatives,\nnor did they have a policy regarding the order of approved\napplicants to be considered for placement. Chief Administrator\nconfirmed Adoption Supervisor had been on the waitlist for a\nplacement and had an approved Adoption Evaluation through\nanother CPA. The surrendered newborn fit the placement\nspecifications of Adoption Supervisor’s evaluation. All fees and\npolicies applied to Adoption Supervisor just as they would with any\nother applicants. Regarding the safeguarding of the biological\nmother’s information, Chief Administrator reported the case was\ntreated as any other case and all laws and policies followed. The\ncase information was a confidential record, just as any other\nadoption. Chief Administrator stated the biological mother’s\ninformation was anonymous, and minimal details were provided\nby the hospital when the baby was placed. The information that\nwas provided was redacted. Chief Administrator noted the Safe\nDelivery process is not perfect, as the court had previously shared\ninformation about biological parents in hearing before. However,\nChief Administrator stated she would not share information and\nwould follow the law.\nDocuments Reviewed\n• Adoption Evaluation of Adoption Supervisor- Completed on\n10/29/2024 by a licensed Child Placing Agency. The\nevaluation recommended adoptive placement of a child 0-\n12 months of age, of any religious background, of\nCaucasian, Hispanic, Asian, bi-racial or of any combination\nof races including African American. The family was\napproved to adopt a child who was generally healthy or\nwith minor and/or correctable impairments through a\ndomestic adoption from the United States. They were\napproved to adopt a child who was exposed to nicotine or\nmarijuana, but not a child that was exposed to alcohol\nduring the pregnancy.\n• Program Statement- The program statement did not\naddress placement with staff or family members. The\ndocument stated, “Each placement will be planned to\nassure an emotionally stable and financially secure home\nfor the child”.\n3",
    "Analysis No violation was found. Based on interviews and documentation\nreview, it was determined the agency followed their policy and\nprocedures regarding placement. The agency did not have a\nspecific policy regarding placement with staff. The placement of\nthe child followed the approved specifications for the adoptive\nhome.\nCONSULTATION:\nThe agency was provided consultation that a policy regarding\nplacement with staff or relatives may be beneficial as it would\nprovide clarification for the court and other service providers,\nshould they have questions or concerns regarding rule compliance\nof future placements.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\n_ ______________April 25, 2025____________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 28, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
