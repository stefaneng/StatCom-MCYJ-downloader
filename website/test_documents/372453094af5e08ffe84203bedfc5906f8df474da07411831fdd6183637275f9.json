    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the reevaluation.\nThe placement specifications shall include all of the following:\n(b) Gender,\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family,\nTwo of the six foster home files reviewed contained an annual evaluation report that\nincluded placement specifications that were different that those identified on the\nassociated license (3706). An annual report for one home dated 10/04/21\nrecommended placement of females only and the corresponding license (3706)\nidentified placement of both male and female (b). An annual report for a second\nhome dated 07/22/22 recommended a capacity of two and the corresponding 3706\nindicated a capacity of four (d).\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(4) Before completion of the written report required by subrule (5\n6) of this rule, an agency shall provide the foster parent with a\nverbal summary of the preliminary findings at the conclusion of\nthe evaluation.\nOne of the two special evaluations reviewed contained a special evaluation report\nthat indicated a verbal summary of the preliminary findings had not been provided to\nthe foster parent. In this instance the foster parent was reported to be uncooperative\nwith the investigation and the recommendation was to not renew the foster home\nlicense. There were no children placed in the home at the time of the investigation.\nThe time period of this investigation was 12/08/21.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers. If children are\ninterviewed, their last names shall not be included in the report.\n4",

The special evaluation was\ndated 03/15/22.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(a) Provide the foster parent with a copy of the report\nrequired by subrule (5) of this rule within 10 calendar days of its\ncompletion.\n(b) Inform the foster parent, in writing, that he or she has a\nright to have his or her written response included as an\nattachment to the report required by subrule (5) of this rule.\nOne of the two special evaluations reviewed did not include adequate\ndocumentation to indicate the foster parent was given a copy of the completed report\n(a) or that they were informed in writing they could have a written response included\nas an attachment to the report (b). The agency typically includes a cover letter that\nis sent along with the report that establishes compliance with this rule. It is probable\nthis was done since the file included a written response by the foster parent,\nhowever, the letter to establish compliance could not be located at the time of this\nevaluation. The date of this special investigation was 12/08/21.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(c) Provide a copy of the report to any social services worker\nthat has children placed in the home.\nOne of the two special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation the\nsocial service worker with children in the home was given a copy of the completed\nspecial evaluation.

The record for\nthe first youth did not have a documented FTM for the time period 11/25/21 to\n02/21/22.
