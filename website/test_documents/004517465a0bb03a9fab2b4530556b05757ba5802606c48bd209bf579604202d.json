Specifically, one report did not include adequate\ninformation regarding compliance with foster home rule 400.9305(2) as the report does\nnot answer the question “what is the water temperature” posed within the report\ntemplate. Additionally, four reports did not include adequate information regarding foster\nhome rule 400.9411(4) as none of the reports include dates the emergency procedures\nwere practiced as required within the report template. Two of the four reports did not\nmention that any practices were completed by the family and two indicated how often\nthey were completed, but did not provide the specific dates. Additionally, no record of the\nemergency evacuation dates of practice were located within any of the files.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make a\nlicensing recommendation to the department at least 15 calendar\ndays before the expiration date of the foster home license.\nOne of three renewal reports reviewed was not completed within the required timeframe.\nThis report was completed on 1/3/19, despite the license expiring on 1/8/29.\nThis is a repeat violation:\n9/14/18 renewal evaluation, CAP approved 10/3/18\n10/27/17 interim evaluation, CAP approved 11/28/17\n4",

    "One of three IL case files did not have a contract signed by the youth every 90 days.\nContracts were on file for 10/1/18, 1/4/19, 4/19/19 and 5/29/19. However, none of them\nwere signed by the youth.\nThis is a repeat violation:\n10/27/17 interim evaluation, CAP approved 11/28/17\n9/14/18 renewal evaluation, CAP approved 10/3/18\nR 400.12509 Independent Living record\n(3) The case record shall contain all of the following information and\ndocumentation, which shall be recorded within 30 calendar days after\nplacement in independent living and updated at least once every 90\ncalendar days:\n(o) Service plans as required in R 400.12419 and R 400.12420.\nOne of three IL case files did not have a service plan completed within 30 days of the\nyouth entering IL (7/17/19).\nR 400.12504 Eligibility requirements\n(2) All of the following shall be in the case record before a youth is\nplaced in independent living: (a) How the youth meets the eligibility\nrequirements for the specific program the youth is being placed into.\nTwo of three IL files did not meet this requirement.\nIL 1: No IL eligibility verification on file.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nCase contacts- During the review it was noted that some parenting time and home\nvisit contacts were sparse, with little detail. The agency was advised that contacts,\nsuch as parenting time, need to thoroughly document interactions, as these contacts\nhave great bearing in service plans and court reports.\nYouth Photos- One youth photo was observed to be very dark and grainy, making it\nalmost impossible to see the youth. The agency was reminded that photos must be\nclear.\n11",
    "Service Plans- Several USPs were not generated and saved in MiSACWIS.\nTherefore, they could not be accessed as a .pdf document for review. The agency\nwas reminded that that the reports must be generated and saved.\nV. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not requested during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. The CAP was approved on 10/3/18, after\nthe 9/14/18 renewal evaluation. The evaluation had a significant number of\nviolations, which has decreased substantially during this review period: 28 violations\nin 2018 compared to 22 violations in 2019. The agency’s thorough CAP and ongoing\nefforts over the past year have provided staff with additional training and more\nstreamlined processes. In addition, the agency was able to hire additional staff,\nwhich has aided in compliance. These efforts have decreased the number of\nviolations, as well as decreased the occurrence of each violation. Overall, the\nagency has shown significant improvement and continues to follow and adjust their\nCAP as needed.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules, ISEP requirements, and contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nOctober 9, 2019\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n12",
