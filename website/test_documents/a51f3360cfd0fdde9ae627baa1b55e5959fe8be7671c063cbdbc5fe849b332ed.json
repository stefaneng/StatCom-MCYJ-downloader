EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted four acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nSIR 2022C0212002 was initiated on 11/22/2021 due to allegations the agency did\nnot complete required monthly contact between siblings. The investigation\ndetermined a violation of R 400.12421 visitation and parenting time. A CAP was\napproved on 1/7/2022 and was completed.\nSIR 2022C0212006 was initiated on 1/26/2022 due to allegations the agency\nconducted two special evaluations in which the findings and recommendations did\nnot accurately reflect the information contained in the report. The investigation\ndetermined a violation of R 400.12327 special evaluation. A CAP was approved on\n4/11/2022 and continues to be implemented at this time.\nSIR 2022C0112007 was initiated on 2/15/2022 due to allegations the agency did not\nprovide reasonable efforts to reunify a family. The investigations determined a\nviolation of FOM 722-06 reasonable efforts. A CAP was approved on 5/4/2022 and\ncontinues to be implemented at this time.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the\ninterim inspection completed on 9/21/2021 with a corrective action plan approved on\n11/5/2021. During the review the agency had eleven violations. Seven citations were\nnoted as repeat violations in the current inspection. During this period under review\nthe agency expressed the impact of adjusting to a hybrid work schedule and high\nneeds cases had on overall compliance. In addition, the agency noted that staff\nturnover and retention impacted overall compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment reported the agency’s difficulty in meeting\nrequirements during this review period. The Chief Administrator stated the previous\nyear CAP was somewhat effective due to processes being put in place that the\nagency feels will reduce the number of citations. The Chief Administrator\nassessment reported ongoing challenges related to staff turnover and hiring a large\nnumber of new staff impacted overall compliance with licensing rules and policy.\nThe Chief Administrator indicated ongoing training and support for staff and\nsupervisors has been a focus of the agency. Additional oversight, utilization of\nQuality Assurance Manager and implementation of checklists have had a positive\nimpact. The Chief Administrator expressed confidence that several areas will\nimprove over the next review period.\n14",
    "Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with four staff via telephone. Staff acknowledged this\nyear has been somewhat difficult due to a large number of newer staff. However,\nthey feel the agency is doing all they can to adjust and provide support and\nanticipate improvement over the next review period. Staff reported supervision is\navailable when needed and they reported no areas of need.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n___________8/19/2022__________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 23, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n15"
