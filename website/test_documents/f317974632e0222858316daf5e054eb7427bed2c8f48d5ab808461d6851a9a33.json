The facility has been requesting youth's last dental\ndocumentation as part of the intake process to allow for more time to be able to\nschedule youth dentals due to the dental provider scheduling several months out.\nThis has been helpful as it allows the facility a larger window to be able to schedule\nand complete dentals to be in compliance with the licensing rules. The facility will\nalso be contracting with Smiles on Wheels to provide on-site, routine dental care\nevery six month to youth placed in the facility. This is tentatively planned to begin\nJune 2024. Chief Administrator also indicated barriers regarding obtaining qualified\nstaff in the area. The facility continues to post job opportunities on Indeed however\nhas not had many applicants and the applicants they have received do not return\ncalls and follow through with the interview/hiring process.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThree employees were interviewed during the onsite visit. All staff reported feeling\nsafe and supported in their job duties. The facility is short staffed however staff\ncontinue to work at ensuring coverage as needed. The facility is actively hiring\nhowever due to the location, the facility has continued to have difficulty finding\nappropriate applicants. There were no concerns noted by staff.\nThree youth were interviewed during onsite visit. The youth interviewed reported\nfeeling safe, feeling respected, and treated well by staff. All youth are attending\nschool onsite at the facility and receiving therapy twice a week. Youth reported\nreceiving three meals a day and snacks.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility was completed during the onsite visit.
