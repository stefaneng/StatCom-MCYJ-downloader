Compliance\n03/18/2021 Exit Conference\nALLEGATION:\nAgency initiated a Special Evaluation on a foster home that was unwarranted, and\nthe findings of fact are inconsistent with the completed evaluation.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the agency’s yearly inspection, it was discovered that they had completed a\nSpecial Evaluation (SE) on a foster that was not warranted, and the findings of fact\nwere inconsistent.\nA review of the Provider File and Case File in MiSACWIS found the following:\n3",
    " The Foster Parents (FP) were first licensed on 11/12/19.\n Licensing Worker 2 (LW 2) was their licensing worker.\n The FP’s are having their Adoption Evaluation completed by a different\nagency.\n The Foster Daughter (FD) and Foster Son (FS) were placed in the home on\n12/15/19.\n FD and FS are siblings and were four and five years old when first placed.\n FD and FS had been in four homes since 2015.\n FD and FS were referred for adoption on 3/15/18.\n The Foster Care Worker (FCW) was assigned to the case on 6/18/20. The\nprevious worker no longer works for the agency.\nThe Special Evaluation (SE) opened on the FP’s home was reviewed:\n The intake for this investigation was on 8/17/20.\n It was completed by Licensing Worker 1 (LW1).\n It was assigned and approved by the Licensing Supervisor (LS).\n Allegation: the youth are touching each other after bedtime. FP do not know\nwhat to do.\n Opened due to concerns about escalating behaviors.\n Rules alleged: 201 Foster home applicant/licensee qualifications, 401 Child\ncapacity, and 404 Behavior management.\n Under 401 the report states that a variance to this rule was obtained so the\nsiblings could share a room.\n It was discussed with the FP's that they would sleep in the living room. The\nreport states a variance was requested on 10/28/20 for the FP to sleep in the\nliving room. Then the report says the variance was to sleep in the basement.\n The family was found in violation of 201 for not having the emotional health\nneeded to be a foster parent.\n States the family shows significant lack of confidence in their decisions and\ncontinually state they do not feel supported or equipped to care for the\nchildren. The report states this is evidenced by hundreds of e-mails back and\nforth between the foster family and the agency (e-mails were uploaded into\nthe Special Evaluation section of MiSACWIS. All the e-mails occurred after\nthe investigation began).\n It was recommended that the caregivers obtain counseling. The report states\nthe family was provided with a list of counselors and they refused to take part\nin counseling. The report did not include any proof of this.\n The report states the family is receiving more support than any other family\nthe agency works with. The report indicated the supervisor expressed\nconcern that if the family did not engage in services offered that the children's\nplacement could be disrupted.\n The caregivers did not attend trainings that were offered.\n The caregivers are not competent in childhood development, utilizing\nresources, self-care nor do they have an adequate support network to meet\nthe needs of the children.\n4",
    " The adoption team indicated they have not been forthcoming in their\nconcerns with the caregivers in an effort not to disrupt the placement.\n The family lacks adequate foundation in childhood development to support\ntherapeutic methods in the home as evidenced by their focus on the negative\ninstead of on the potential.\n The foster family does not have realistic expectations of support from foster\ncare, licensing, or adoption.\n They do not possess adequate emotional coping skills for this situation.\n The report states that the caregivers agreed that counseling would be\nbeneficial for their situation.\n It was reported that the caregivers completed a satisfaction survey and stated\nthey did not feel supported. This resulted in a case review.\n Under rule 404 Behavior Management the report indicated a meeting\noccurred with the family on 10/16/20; the use of the word restraint was\naddressed with the caregivers. They demonstrated that the way they create\nphysical distance from the aggressive child to ensure the family members\nsafety was appropriate and did not constitute a restraint.\n Under additional findings the report stated there were no additional findings,\nhowever an analysis was added to this section that indicated the caregiver’s\ninsufficient emotional health to support the needs of the children in their care.\n Report was signed on 11/23/20 (98 days after the SE was opened).\n The Children's Foster Home Rules Compliance Record CWL-3080 was\ncompleted on 11/11/20.\nReview of documentation included under this SE in MiSACWIS:\n The initiation letter dated 8/20/20 sent to the family cites rule 306 Bedrooms.\n The Special Evaluation Record (CWL-259) which is utilized to open the SE\nstated the intake date was 8/17/20 and the alleged rule violation was 401\nChild capacity; living arrangement.\n The 45-day extension letter to the caregivers was dated 10/14/20 (58 days). It\nindicates there were additional \"incidents\" that require evaluation.\n A variance dated 1/7/20 addressed Rule 401 Child Capacity; living\narrangement and allowed for the siblings to share a room.\n Another variance dated 9/1/20 was for 306 Bedrooms and addressed the\ncaregivers sleeping in the living room in order for the children to have their\nown bedrooms.\n The Special Investigation Record (CWL-259) closing the investigation was\ndated 9/29/20.\n SE signed 11/23/20.\n 45-day extension indicated.\n 90-day extension and approvals not indicated.\n5",
    "Review of E-mails included under this SE in MiSACWIS:\n 8/20/20 E-mail chain about the start of the SE and setting up a meeting. The\nfamily expressed their frustrations with the lack of communication and support\nfrom the agency.\n 8/24/20 LW 1 sent the Foster Father (FF) contact info of a veteran FP for\nsupport.\n 8/31/20 E-mail chain about the issues the FP had over the weekend with the\nFS. The e-mail chain was started by the FCW and in it she stated the family\nhad reported to her in a text that the FF restrained the FS.\n 9/3/20 E-mail from Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) to the team indicated that\nthe FF had to \"restrain\" the FS.\n 9/4/20 an e-mail from LW 1 to the FF and team indicated that she did not\nhave any doubts that the FP’s were capable of being the parents to the foster\nchildren.\n 9/11/20 LW 1 sent an e-mail to the family. She wrote that she has been doing\nsome \"soul searching\" trying to reconcile herself to the \"darned\" Special\nEvaluation. After hearing all of the techniques the family is utilizing with the\nFS she was not sure she wanted to write the report the same way. She wrote\nthat she thought the family had demonstrated a good and appropriate grasp\non de-escalation techniques. While the family did not trust their own\ndecisions, they were doing some really good things.\n 9/14/20 LW 1 sent an e-mail stating she would get the SE report to them\nbefore the end of the week.\n 9/22/20 E-mail from LW 1 to the team that she has finished the SE report and\nhad written a CAP for them to follow.\n 9/24/20 e-mail from LW 1 to FP’s indicating that she attached the findings of\nthe SE indicating a hard copy would be sent in the mail.\n 9/29/20 An e-mail from LW 1 to the FP’s stated that the FF discussed the SE\nin wraparound. The LW 1 stated that the SE was not a matter to be discussed\nin the wrap around meeting.\n 10/14/20 an e-mail chain started when LW 1 sent an email stating she\nreceived an e-mail indicating they had restrained the FS. LW 1 stated that she\nknew the family was trying everything the agency suggests and are doing\nsuch a great job overall. She states that they will need to address the physical\nrestraint because it is a licensing violation. The family responded that they\nwere confused as to why this was being addressed now and not the very first\ntime they did it two months ago. They stated they have reported every\nrestraint they have done to the agency.\n 11/4/20 LW 1 sent an e-mail asking the FP’s for a meeting to discuss the final\ndetails of the SE report.\n 11/23/20 in an e-mail from LW 1 to the FP’s she wrote that she had to do\nsome re-writing of the report and re-iterated that this was her first Special\nEvaluation Report she had to write. She wrote that it would be all set to mail\nout to them on 11/27/20.\n 12/7/20 report sent to FP's.\n6",
    " 12/14/20 the FM asked if she could share some of the report details with\nothers except for anyone not connected to the kids’ case. LW 1 responded\nthat the SE is \"…solely about being licensed foster parents. It is not about the\ncourt case and should not be entered into the court case. Court is about the\nchildren, their services, and their permanency plan.\"\n 12/23/20 e-mails from the FP’s indicating they would like a response from the\nLicensing Supervisor (LS) in regard to their rebuttal to the SE.\n Lots of e-mails back and forth regarding training but all after SE began.\nContacts in MiSAWIS from the placement of the siblings (12/15/19) to the start of the\nSE were reviewed for both the provider and the case. The following information was\nnoted in the contacts.\n FCW Home Visit’s (HV) during this period of time do not indicate any\nconcerns from the FCW just concerns brought up by the FP’s.\n 4/8/20 Phone Call with FP's indicated concerns with lack of follow through\nfrom FCW.\n 4/9/20 Family Team Meeting (FTM) FP's Expressed the need to feel validated\nfor what they are doing right or wrong. FP felt overwhelmed a few weeks ago\nbut recently things have been better. Agency will meet with family once a\nweek to provide support during COVID. Parent support partner referral\ndiscussed.\n 4/23/20 Team Discussion regarding support areas. Team believes they need\nto be direct in asking if the FP's are committed to the children and not\ndragging out or searching for services that won't benefit if the couple has\nalready decided they will not continue with adoption. The FCS will have that\ndiscussion with the family during the video HV on 4/25/2020.\n 7/8/20 FTM indicates the Family’s strengths are that they are developing an\namazing bond, they give lots of hugs, they talk and communicate.\n 7/15/20 A complaint had been called in regarding the touching and the worker\nneeded to do a HV.\n 8/17/20 LW 1 e-mails family regarding SE.\n There were 15 e-mails and two text messages received from the FP’s during\nthis period. The topics of the messages included: a picture, information about\ndoctor visits, problem behaviors from the kids, on-line schooling, allegations\nthe kids were making, and concerns about their previous placement.\n Of the contacts from the FP’s to the agency only two of them indicated the\nFP’s were asking for additional help.\n Three contacts indicate that the family was provided with training resources.\nTwo of those contacts occurred after the allegations about the kids touching.\nA timeline of events that occurred with the FP's was provided by the agency. Many\nof the contacts listed in the timeline were not found in MiSACWIS. Some contacts in\nMiSACWIS were not in the timeline. The following information was found in the\ntimeline:\n Contacts that indicated the FP's were provided with materials and trainings\nto help them with the children.\n7",
    " The FP's did follow up with the supportive adoptive parent but did not get a\nresponse back.\n Many services were put in place: wraparound, behavior support specialist,\ntherapy, parent support partner, and weekly meetings with the agency.\n A contact from 4/17/20 states the FCW talked to the FP's about counseling\nfor themselves and the FP's were open to that. It did not indicate a list of\nproviders was included.\n The Adoption Worker states that the children and agency are very lucky to\nhave the FP's. The FP's have been tested and pushed to their limits. Despite\nthis they continue to show the children love, care, and advocacy. The\nchildren were doing better in the FP's home than they did with other FP's The\nFP's are good at communicating and asking questions to gain a better\nunderstanding. They are willing to gain experience and knowledge from\nanyone. The FP's could benefit from additional support from the team to help\nthem understand, process, and respond to the children's trauma.\n A contact between LW 1 and LW 2 stated that the FP's not doing the\ntrainings sent to them was not a refusal to attend trainings they just have not\ndone them yet. She stated there were not weekly e-mails regarding trainings.\n The LW 1 did not think the FP's were the right parents for the children. Later\non, when including the family in an e-mail, she stated that she had no doubt\nthe FP's were capable of being parents to the siblings.\n On 9/9/20 the team expressed concerns that if the family wanted to continue\nwith the adoption then the adoption agency would deny them.\n On 9/11/20 LW 1 e-mailed the team at the agency asking them to review her\nsummary of findings for the SE.\n LW 1 stated in a letter that the 300 e-mails were between the agency and the\nFP's. Not just e-mails from the FP's.\n On 10/15/20 an e-mail from LW 1 to the team stated that the agency\ndropped the ball when the FP's mentioned in court that the FP's had\nrestrained the FS and the family had mentioned this to the agency on three\nother occasions.\n The SE was mailed to FP's on 12/7/20.\nThe family completed the following trainings prior to the investigation starting.\n Pressley Ridge Foster Parent Training on 9/4/18\n Foster Home Orientation on 8/20/19.\n De-escalation and Crisis Intervention on 9/5/19.\n Re-orientation to Foster Home Rules and Holy Cross Licensing Expectations\non 8/13/20 & 8/15/20.\nEmployee File Documentation was provided by the Chief Administrator:\n The Licensing Supervisor (LS) was hired on 1/21/20. She completed DCWL’s\ncomplaint training for Licensing Workers on 4/30/19. She did not have any\ndisciplines in her file.\n8",
    " The Foster care Supervisor (FCS) was hired on 5/14/08. She was hired into\nher current position on 5/5/18. She had one discipline in her file from 2015\nthat had to do with lack of communication and being late for court.\n The Foster Care worker (FCW) was hired on 5/11/20. She took her Foster\nCare training on 6/19/20. She had one discipline in her file from 1/6/21\nregarding professional behavior.\n Licensing Worker 2 was hired on 6/11/18. She completed DCWL Complaint\ntraining in 2018. She had one discipline in her file from 9/2/20 regarding\nsharing case information with a former employee.\n Licensing Worker 1 was hired on 8/19/19. She received her complaint training\non 10/11/19. She had two disciplines in her file from 1/6/21 regarding not\ncompleting audit forms and from 1/26/21 in which she was insubordinate and\ndisrespectful to her supervisor.\nThe FP's submitted a rebuttal to the SE. The rebuttal was dated 12/21/20. The\npurpose of the rebuttal is to provide additional information \"purposefully\" left out of\nthe Special Evaluation Report, to correct inaccurate information, and to prove that\nthe agency and its employees have been negligent in their work on the foster care\ncase.\nThe rebuttal indicated the following:\n The first incident of the kids touching each other’s private parts occurred on\n7/13/20.\n The FP’s reported another incident of touching to the agency on 8/15/20.\n When the worker came out to do a visit, she told the foster family that a\nSpecial Evaluation would be opened due to the repeat behaviors. She told\nthem LW 1 would be conducting the investigation. The FP’s expressed\nconcerns about LW 1 and the FCW stated she had the same concerns.\n When the FP’s first met with LW 1 she listened to their concerns then stated\ntheir concerns had to do with the previous FCW not doing her job and that is\nwhy she was fired.\n LW 1 met with the family on 9/14 via zoom. She shared her screen with the\nfamily, then navigated through MiSACWIS to the FP's SE. At this time the\nLW 1 informed the family they were investigated for Rule 201 Foster home\napplicant/licensee qualifications. When the FM expressed concern that the\naddition of a different rule violation was a way for the agency to justify the\nSE, LW 1 agreed with the FM. The family was able to see other families\nlisted on LW 1's screen.\n The number of e-mails sent to the agency was \"grossly overexaggerated\"\nand the agency never expressed concern regarding the number of e-mails\nthey sent.\n LW 1 said she would give them the contact of her pastor’s wife who is a\ncounselor but said she would only do the work to get them resources if they\npromised to go through with the adoption of the children.\n At the 9/15/20 court hearing the family brought up the SE.\n9",
    " When the FP met with LW 1 she informed them that the SE is a licensing\nissue and should not be shared with the court\n The family listed training resources that were sent. The trainings they took\npart in and the reasons for not taking part in other trainings. Their reasoning\nfor not participating in trainings was mostly due to the content of the training\nnot being relevant for them. Of the list of trainings only two had been\nrelevant for the family. One was already done by the family and the other\ntraining only became relevant after the training was offered.\n During a behavior incident with the FS on 9/3/20 the Foster Father (FF)\ncalled the agency to tell them to come pick up the kids.\n The family wrote that they believed the agency had withheld information\nfrom them about the abuse the children received in their previous foster\nhome.\n The family stated they never received a list of counselors.\n Therapist never gave them resources for counselors.\n The family shared the details of the SE with the court because the worker\nonly stated the children were thriving and did not discuss the behaviors the\nyouth were having.\nFoster Parent (FP) Interview: The Foster Parents were interviewed on 2/4/21 via\nvideo conferencing. The FP's stated they had concerns with their previous Foster\nCare Worker (FCW). She did not communicate with them well. They asked for\ncounseling services for the kids. The worker would tell them she sent in the referral\nthen two weeks would go by and she would send it again. The kids started therapy\nin March of 2020.\nThe family was not asking for specific services but wanted the agency to provide\nthem with any resources they had. They said they did not know what to ask for. They\nthought the agency would help with that.\nThe family was asked about the statement the Foster Father (FF) said telling the\nagency to come get the kids. He said there had been several incidents with the FS\nand the FF felt frustrated and alone. He did not mean for the children to actually be\nremoved he was just saying it out of frustration. The agency then set up respite for\nthe weekend.\nThey did not know what to do if behaviors escalated. The emergency numbers they\nwere provided with did not provide them with support. The FF stated that what he\ncalled was a restraint was him holding his FS against the wall after the FS would\nraise his fist. He also set his FS in a chair and took him to his room by holding his\narms. The FF stated that his FS would fight while being held but the FF was trying to\nkeep his FS from his target.\nThey had many conversations with the Chief Administrator (CA) and the LS but they\nfelt they were getting mixed messages from them. The CA told them that the\n10",
    "children should not have been placed with them and that the agency made a lot of\nmistakes. They are meeting with LW 2 weekly.\nThe FP's feel the agency has been withholding things from them. They do not feel\nthey can depend on the agency. They think the agency is against them now. They\nwrote the rebuttal to address issues so other families do not have a similar\nexperience.\nThe family was asked where they are at regarding the adoption. They stated no one\nhas ever come out and asked them that. They stated they are open to hard truths.\nThe kids are still living with them, but due to the difficulties they have had they\ncannot think about long term right now. They want what is best for the kids. If that\nmeans they are not what is best, then they can accept that. They will not give up on\nthe kids. Their feelings have been communicated to the adoption agency and the\nagency has not pressured them to make a decision.\nThe family sent an e-mail they received from the FCW on 7/15/20 that stated she\nwas confused why the children touching each other was called in as a complaint as\nthere were not any safety concerns.\nAll agency staff were interviewed on 2/5/21 utilizing video conferencing.\nLicensing Supervisor (LS) interview: The LS stated the agency had been working\nwith the family for quite some time, but the family still felt unsupported. The FP's\nwere e-mailing frequently. The agency provided them with a multitude of resources.\nThe FP's indicated they did not think they were the right parents for the children that\nwere in their home. The agency figured something had to be going on that was\nescalating the kids’ behaviors. They looked at the rules to see if there was\nsomething that needed to be investigated. She stated the family was saying they\nwere using restraint and the kids were touching each other. The LS talked to LW 1\nabout where these things fall in the licensing rules. The family had sent e-mails\nsaying they had restrained the FS. The LS was asked what the FP's were doing\nwrong and she stated she did not know that they were doing anything wrong. It had\nmore to do with what was going on with those specific children. The family wanted\nmore results and they wanted them sooner. The agency would not have opened an\ninvestigation if concerns were brought up just one time, but the concerns continued\nto be brought up.\nThe LS stated LW 1 made a mistake in citing Rule 401 Child Capacity; living\narrangements. LS did not know why the CWL-259 was closed in September. The LS\nstated she did read the report and signed it. The first draft was poorly written, but the\nsecond draft was better. It was not until she received the rebuttal from the family that\nshe saw it was not in line with what the family reported.\nAfter receiving the rebuttal, she reached out to other service providers. The Adoption\nAgency told the LS the same information that was in the SE but the wording and\n11",
    "intent of what they said was inaccurate. The LS did not agree with the citations after\nlooking into it. Some of the FP's concerns were valid from their own point of view,\nbut they did not know all the work that was going on behind the scenes to get them\nthe help they needed.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) Interview: The FCS stated the agency was\nreceiving a lot of e-mails from the FP's. The family was struggling even though\nresources were in place. They needed additional assistance. She did not think the\nfamily did anything wrong, they just did not have any confidence. She did not think\nthey violated any rules. They were given tools they did not follow through on. LW 2\nprovided the FP's with a list of providers who could provide individual therapy for\nthem. They were also provided with different trainings, but she was unsure if they\nknew what they needed. The agency should have guided them. She did not read the\nentire SE report but said what she did read of it was harsh. She does agree with the\ncitation but not the wording. She also stated she thought they were of sound\nemotional health.\nThe FCS was asked to forward the e-mail that listed therapy service providers. As of\nthe writing of this report that e-mail has not been received and there is no contact in\nMiSACWIS to indicate this was sent.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) Interview: The FCW has been assigned to this case\nsince June of 2020. She did review the SE report and thought it could have been\nwritten in a nicer way. She did not have concerns about the safety of the children in\nthe home. She had concerns about the FP’s not being invested in the adoption of\nthe children. The family did not feel supported even though the agency would\nprovide them with services. She thought they did lack emotional health and self-\ncare. They do not take advantage of respite services and do not utilize the resources\nfor individual therapy. Their lack of self-care impacts how they care for the children.\nThe FS's behaviors and the things he says become so overwhelming. The FP's do\nnot take time to process these behaviors. In September FF said they could not do\nthis, and the FS said does this mean we cannot come back. The kids can sense\nwhen something is wrong. The FCW shared her concerns with the FP's about self-\ncare and they stated they did not want counseling. She did not share with the FP's\nhow their lack of self-care effects the kids. The FF would put his hands on the FS in\norder to hold him back. She did not have any concerns with this.\nLicensing Worker 2 (LW 2) Interview: LW 2 is the FP's assigned Licensing\nWorker. She was the worker that licensed the home. She has reviewed the SE and\nthere were areas she was confused about. The reason for the SE was that the\nsiblings were touching each other inappropriately. There have been on-going\nconcerns as the agency feels they are providing support, but the family felt they did\nnot. LW 2 felt they had enough support. The SE should have focused on the kids\nbeing safe in the home due to the touching. Everyone thinks the FP's are doing the\nbest they can. She did provide the family with counseling recommendations, but they\ndid not want to use them. They currently have Corrective Action Plan (CAP)\n12",
    "meetings with the family so the family can air out their concerns. The family needed\nmore direct instruction from the agency, and they are now providing that. She does\nnot agree with the SE findings regarding a lack of emotional health. An SE did need\nto be opened, but only due to the touching going on.\nLicensing Worker 1 (LW1) Interview: LW 1 has been with the agency for 1.5\nyears. She was a FCW before becoming a licensing worker. She first met the family\nduring their orientation that she did with LW 2. There were conversations in the\noffice that the agency was receiving lots of e-mails from the family and that the\nplacement was \"not settled.\" There were allegations about the kids touching each\nother and conversations followed about how best to deal with these behaviors. The\nFCS stated something needs to be done due to the continued concerns with the\nfamily. LW 1 was then assigned to do the SE. The concern was that the children\nwere unable to safely share a room and the parents being unable to manage the\nkids’ behaviors. She was mostly looking into how to create \"balance, peace, and\nsafety\" in the home. Regardless of the supports that were provided the problems\nwere not getting better. There were consistent complaints from the family that they\nwere not being supported. LW 2 spoke to the family many times and it was obvious\nthat the family did not feel heard prior to this. The family could not see the positive\nresults and felt they were not doing well because of it. It did not seem as though any\ntool would provide results. The family felt constantly defeated. The FP's loved the\nchildren but they could not hear they were doing well by doing what they could. They\ndid not have the ability to hear the positives. The family did not understand the\ninformation they were provided with during the full disclosure meeting; specifically,\nthey did not understand the children’s behaviors and trauma history. The SE was the\nlast resort. The FP's were not in an emotional place to handle the kids’ behaviors.\nThey always felt they needed more. They needed to seek help for themselves first\nthen it would not have gotten as bad as it did. The family was not engaged in\nenough of the right training. LW 1 did not create the original CWL-259 so she was\nunaware what was cited. The fact that the report stated no additional findings was an\nerror. She added the citation for behavior management because at the court hearing\nthe FF stated he had to restrain his FS. The FP's were told they did everything right\nand there were no findings for Behavior Management. He just put the FS back in his\nseat. She reviewed the definition of physical restraint and discussed it with the FCS\nand LS.\nThe family was provided with numerous services for themselves like training and\nseminars but they did not engage in any of them. The FP's were not going outside\nthemselves to get help. The FP's also did not seek out the FP mentor whose contact\ninformation they were provided with until the end of the year. LW 1 stated the proof\nof all the resources that were provided to the family are all documented in the case\nrecord.\nLW 1 believes the family was not competent in child development as they did not\nknow what was age appropriate and what was not.\n13",
    "Regarding the Closing CWL-259 she did not realize she needed to wait for approval\nbefore submitting it. When she first went through the SE with the FP's they were very\nheated. She then went back and re-wrote it. She heard about the restraint at the\ncourt date prior to re-writing the SE.\nLW 1 said the CA denied her the ability to read the rebuttal (rebuttal is uploaded into\nthe SE section in MiSACWIS).\nThe Children’s Foster Home Licensing Technical Assistance (TA) manual is utilized\nas a training tool during Licensing training and is available to all licensing workers to\nreference. The manual states the following regarding Special Evaluations:\n If including additional allegations will prevent completion of an investigation in\na timely manner and they are not directly related to the ongoing investigation,\nthe agency may open a new investigation.\n The completion of the investigation shall not exceed 90 days.

    "ANALYSIS: The SE stated that the Foster Parents were provided with\ncounseling resources. The family denied this was the case.\nThere was no proof in the SE or in the case record that this was\ntrue.\nThe family stated the Foster Father had asked for the kids to be\nremoved, yet this was not in the SE.\nThe SE report did not provide examples or proof that the Foster\nParents did not have the emotional health or the understanding\nof child development that was needed to provide for the\nchildren. LW 1 referenced hundreds of e-mails from the foster\nparents asking for assistance but the case record did not\nindicate this. The timeline indicated over 300 e-mails between\nthe agency and the FP’s. The interviews and the timeline all\nindicate the FP’s were doing the best they could given the\nsituation they were in.\nThe SE also stated the FP’s were provided with trainings that\nthey refused to utilize. The FP’s stated the trainings they were\nprovided with were not suitable to their situation. There was no\nproof provided in the SE or in the provider record that the FP’s\nrefused trainings.\nIn the SE LW 1 reported that a variance was given for the foster\nparents to sleep in the basement, but the variance was for the\nfoster parents to sleep in the living room.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nAs noted above the timeline for the SE was:\n15",

    "Please refer to narrative in investigation section above regarding interviews with LS\nand LW1 and documents reviewed.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications.\n(1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a\nperson who has the ability, experience, education, and\ntraining to perform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: The Licensing Supervisor signed the Special Evaluation Report\nindicating she approved it despite all of the errors in the report.\nThis indicated the LS does not have the ability, experience,\neducation, or training to perform her job duties.\nLicensing Worker 1 sent the Closing CWL-259 to the department\nprior to the investigation being completed. LW 1 did not have any\nevidence that the FP’s did not have the emotional health to\nprovide care to the kids, yet she found them in violation. LW 1 did\nnot get the 45-day extension letter out until after the 45 days was\nup nor did she get an approval to extend the investigation past 90\ndays. There were additional allegations that came in after LW 1\nwas finishing up her report, however she tacked them on to the\nSE already opened instead of starting a new SE. LW 1 admitted\nthat she made a mistake with the additional findings section of\nthe report. There were multiple errors in LW 1’s report that\nindicate she did not have the ability, experience, education or\ntraining to perform her job duties.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
