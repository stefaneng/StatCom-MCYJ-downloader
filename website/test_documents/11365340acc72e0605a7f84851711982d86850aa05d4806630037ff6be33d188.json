Review of incident report. Review of Special investigation\nReport #2019C0219049.\n08/28/20 Exit with Director, Area Manager, Licensing Consultant Chris Barr.\nTechnical Assistance was given around avoiding restraining\nresidents on the wall.\nALLEGATION:\nResident was restrained after assaulting another resident. Resident sustained\na chipped tooth during the restraint.\nINVESTIGATION:\n An incident report was submitted into MiSACWIS on December 18, 2019\nregarding the allegation that occurred on December 16, 2019, incident\nnumber 80210150. The incident report stated that while on Pod A, Resident\nA and Resident B engaged in a verbal dispute. Resident A then assaulted\nResident B by striking him in the chest. Resident A was physically managed\nby Staff 1 and placed on Seclusion status with the approval Shift Supervisor\nA. Resident A sustained a chipped tooth during the restraint hitting the\ncontrol room window as he was being restrained from the rear while Resident\nB did not incur any injuries. Both residents were examined by the Facility\nNurse.\n2",
    " On May 12, 2020, another DHHS Worker sent an email to the DCWL Director\nseeking information pertaining to the above allegation. The concern was that\nLincoln Center completed an internal investigation which Lincoln Center sent\nthe incident report to DHHS Supervisor about the incident but the allegation\nwas not sent to Child Welfare Licensing to open a complaint on the facility\nbase on the allegation received by DHHS during that time.\n On May12, 2020 the DCWL Director responded to the concern of another\nDHHS Staff by stating that DCWL do not receive all incident reports from\nChild Caring Institution (CCI). CCI’s are required in licensing rules to notify\nDCWL of serious injury or illness of a resident requiring inpatient\nhospitalization. The assigned Consultant for Lincoln Center was copied on\nthe email to determine whether an allegation was received of improper\nrestraint or behavior management related to this incident. The response\nstated that based on the information provided, it was not clear whether there\nwere allegations related to this incident. At that time, an investigation was\nassigned.\n Video surveillance of this incident was not reviewed base on the time frame\nof the incident.\n I reviewed Special Investigation Report ##2019C0219049 dated October 14,\n2019. This report provided technical assistance to Lincoln Center stating that\ncaution should be exercised when transferring a resident into the primary\nrestraint technique and while resisting and near a wall, as to prevent any\nforceful contact. Positioning of a resident to a wall is reserved only for the\nplacement of mechanical restraints on and without force.\nI interviewed Resident A, age 14, on May 28, 2020. He reported his peer, Resident\nB was laughing at him for no apparent reason and he asked him to stop and\nResident B continued to laugh. He said he approached Resident B and told him that\nhe was going to give him five minutes to stop laughing or that he was going to tear\nhis Christmas decoration down from his door. He said Resident B continued to\nlaugh and he proceeded to try to rip the decoration from Resident B’s door but\nbefore he could touch the door, Staff 1 grabbed him and threw him against the door\nwindow causing him to chip his tooth. He said he already had a cap on that tooth\nand when he was grabbed from behind under his arms, his arms went up in the air\nand his face went into the door window causing the cap to fall off and his tooth being\nchip. Resident A said he was not being aggressive towards his peer and he felt that\nhe should not have gotten restrained. He said he waited until the midnight shift\nstarted and that is when he told the midnight shift supervisor about the incident and\nhis chip tooth. He said he received medical attention the next day. Resident A said\nhe did not chip his own tooth; he did not bang his head on the wall or acted\naggressively when he was restrained. He said he went into his room without\nincident. He added no additional information.\nI interviewed Resident B, age 17, on May 28, 2020. He reported he was laughing at\nother peers on the pod and Resident A assumed he was laughing at him and told\n3",
    "him to stop laughing. He said he ignored Resident A and continued to laugh and\nResident A starting walking towards where he was standing which was by his\nbedroom door. He said Resident A reached pass him and tried to tear his Christmas\ndecoration off his door. He said he pushed Resident A’s arm off his door and out of\nnowhere, Staff 1 approached the two of them and restrained Resident A against the\nwall. He said Resident A face was against the door window and that Staff 1 had\nResident A on the wall in a “Chicken wing” position. Resident B said he did not think\nthat the restraint of Resident A was appropriate or necessary. He denied that\nResident A was trying to assault him.\nI interviewed Resident C, age 16, who was a witness to the incident between\nResident A and Staff 1. He said Resident B was laughing and Resident A told\nResident B to stop and that he was going to give Resident B something to laugh at.\nHe said Resident B continued to laugh and Resident A began approaching Resident\nB and reached past pass Resident B trying to tear down Resident B’s decoration.\nHe said Staff 1 restrained Resident A and that he (Resident C) observed Resident A\nface hit the window. He said Resident A was place in his room until showers.\nResident C said at no time did Resident A bang on his door or wall while in his\nbedroom. Resident C reported that he felt the restraint of Resident A was not\nnecessary.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on May 28, 2020. He reported that Resident A had been a\n“terror” on the shift throughout the day. He said he was working another pod and\nwas sent over to work Resident A’s pod because there was two newer staff working\nthe pod. He said he exchanged positions with one of the newer staff because the\nsupervisor wanted a veteran staff to work the pod. He said that Resident A had\nbeen written up because he was having a bad day. He said the Residential Director\nhad a meeting with that pod for over an hour trying to calm the group down. He said\nResident A was refusing to follow all directions from staff and continued to threaten\nand attempted to hit Resident B. He said Resident A was going nuts trying to tear\ndown decorations from his peer doors that his peers had worked on all morning\ndecorating. He said Resident A approached Resident B and started fighting with\nResident B and that he (Staff 1) grabbed Resident A with Handle with Care\nTechniques. He said he did not know how Resident A’s tooth got chip. He said from\nhis knowledge, Resident A’s face did not touch the wall or the window. He said\nResident A went into his room without struggle and was calm. He said Resident A\ndid not mention anything to him about his tooth being chipped. He reported the last\ntime he had a refresher course with the facility prescribed behavior management\ntechniques was last spring. Staff 1 reported he is not a full - time employee at the\nfacility but was an on-call staff.\nI interviewed the Facility Nurse on May 28, 2020. She reported that Resident A’s\ntooth was chipped prior to entering Lincoln Center on October 16, 2019. She said it\nwas documented in the nurse’s notes that Resident A entered the facility with a\nsmall chip to his front corner tooth. She said Resident A did not complain about his\ntooth between the months of October 16, 2019 to December 16, 2019. The nurse\n4",
    "said she went to examine Resident A the next day on December 17, 2020 due to\npolicy that anytime a resident is physically managed by staff, he is seen by the\nfacility nurse within twenty four hours, unless there is an emergency and he needs to\nbe seen sooner. The nurse said when she spoke to Resident A he told her that his\ntooth had broken more than it was prior to his arrival. The nurse described Resident\nA’s tooth as a small tooth chip in the front corner of his mouth. She said she made\nappointments with the dentist for Resident A. She said the first time the dentist saw\nResident A was December 23, 2019. She said at time she had reviewed her notes\nprior to the dentist appointment which stated he had the chipped tooth prior to this\nplacement at the facility. She said Resident A agreed that he had a chip tooth upon\narrival but stated that it was, “made larger,” by the restraint, The nurse reported that\nResident A was seen by the dentist on December 23, and he again received the\nservices of the dentist twice in January and once in February and March. received\nthe services of the dentist twice in January and once in February and March. The\ndentist replaced the cap on the chipped tooth. She said she could not confirm that\nResident A’s tooth was chipped because of the restraint. She explained that a cap\nusually has to be replaced every five years.\nI interviewed Supervisor A regarding the allegation on May 28, 2020. He reported\nhe never saw the restraint and did not witness the incident. He added no additional\ninformation.\nI attempted contact with Staff 2 who was working the shift with Staff 1. He resigned\nhis position on February 26, 2020 and the agency reported his last telephone\nnumber was not operational/disconnected.\nI interviewed the Executive Director and she said I interviewed the Executive\nDirector and she said she did not feel this was an abuse/neglect case. She said the\ninformation was inputted into MiSACWIS and all reporting source was informed of\nthe incident.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written\npolicies and procedures regarding restraint. These\npolicies and procedures shall be available to all\nresidents, their families, and referring agencies.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: The Supervisor reported he did not witness the restraint.\nThe Facility Nurse reported Resident A did not have any issues\nwith his tooth prior to being restrained on December 16, 2019.\nShe reported it was documented in the nurse’s notes that\nResident A entered the facility with a small chip to his front\ncorner tooth. She said Resident A did not complain about his\ntooth between the months of October 16, 2019 to December 16,\n2019. The nurse said she went to examine Resident A the next\nday due to policy that anytime a resident is physically manage\nby staff, he is seen by the facility nurse within twenty - four\nhours, unless there is an emergency. The nurse said when she\nspoke to Resident A he told her that his tooth had broken more.\nThe residents interviewed did not mention that the group was\nhaving issues on the pod. All of the residents were consistent in\nstating there was no fight between Resident A and Resident B.\nAll of the residents interviewed reported they felt the restraint of\nResident A by Staff 1 was not appropriate or necessary.\nSpecial Investigation Report ##2019C0219049 dated October\n14, 2019, provided technical assistance to Lincoln Center\nstating that caution should be exercised when transferring a\nresident into the primary restraint technique and while resisting\nand near a wall, as to prevent any forceful contact. Positioning\nof a resident to a wall is reserved only for the placement of\nmechanical restraints on and without force.\nIt is not determined that Resident A’s tooth was chip during the\nrestraint that occurred on December 16, 2019, however, it is\ndetermine that Resident A was inappropriately restrained.\nBased on the interviews of the residents, and Special\nInvestigation #2019C0219049, the facility is in violation with not\nfollowing their written policies and procedures regarding\nfollowing their Handle with Care techniques.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon completion of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend that Lincoln\nCenter License remain unchanged.\n08/28/2020\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 28, 2020\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n7"
