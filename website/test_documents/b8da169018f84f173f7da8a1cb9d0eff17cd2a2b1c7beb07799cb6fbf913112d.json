Exit Conference- Reviewed\ncontent of Special investigation report. CA had no additional\ninformation to provide.\nALLEGATION:\nConfidential information regarding multiple individuals, many foster children,\nserviced by the agency was breached.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/4/2022 I reviewed the complaint document which was in the form of a letter to\nthe Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS)-Contract\nAdministrator X, from Home for Black Children’s (HBC) Chief Administrator (CA) 1\ndate 4/28/2022. The letter advised DHHS-Contract Administrator X of a recent data\nsecurity event that may affect the security of personal information related to\nMichigan residents subject to HBC’s contract with the state. This letter reported the\nfollowing information:\n Supplement information with new significant facts may be provided later.\n HBC through a third- party document review vendor, completed a\ncomprehensive programmatic and manual review of the at-risk files and\nfolders. HBC determined personal information related to 384 individuals,\nlargely minor children, who received services from HBC pursuant to the\ncontract with MDHHS may have been accessible. Out of the 384 individuals,\n103 individuals required notice under Michigan state law as information that\nconstitutes person information, namely social security numbers under MCLA.\n445.63(r) was identified as at-risk.\n Out of the 384, 117 individuals residing in Michigan were identified as having\ninformation impacted that is not protected by Michigan state law, including\n3",
    "date of birth, Person ID, medical information, and health insurance\ninformation. HBC is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), as it is not a health care provider,\nand it does not transmit health information in electronic form in connection\nwith covered tractions. Additionally, Michigan state law does not protect\ndates of birth, Person IDs, medical information, or health insurance\ninformation. Unless directed otherwise, HBC does not intend to provide\nwritten notice to the 117 known Michigan residents whose only impacted data\nelements are date of birth, Person ID, medical information, and /or health\ninsurance information.\n Of the total population of individuals associated with the State, there are 164\nindividuals for whom notice may be required, but whom HBC does not have\nsufficient address information to make this determination. To the extent that\nall of these individuals reside in Michigan, as HBC expect is the case, notice\nis not required under state law as these individuals have only the following\ndata element impacted, which are not protected by Michigan state law: date\nof birth, Person ID, medical information, and/or health insurance information.\nHBC could securely provide a list of individuals associated for the State. At a\nminimum HBC would need confirmation from the State that these are\nresidents of Michigan.\n Before HBC can provide notice to those individuals requiring notice under\nMichigan state law, HBC was reviewing its internal records to confirm the\nidentities of the potentially affected individuals and locating address\ninformation needed to notify them. For certain individuals who received\nservices pursuant to the MDHHS contract, HBC no longer maintained active\nrecords. For those record HBC would need the State to provide address\ninformation in order for HBC to mail notification letters. HBC had identified\n172 individuals associated with the State for whom they could not locate an\naddress. HBC reported they could securely send a file of those identified\nindividuals to the State; and asked by what method did the State want to\nreceive that information and assist in providing the missing addresses.\n In the interim HBC would continue preparing to provide written notifications to\nindividuals by way of letter (a sample draft letter was reported to be attached,\nthat sample letter was not included with the complaint document I received)\nFor children impacted, HBC indicated a similar version of that letter would be\nused and addressed to the parent or guardian of any minor child. Additionally,\ncredit monitoring would be offered, to the extent a social security number was\nidentified as impacted.\nOn 5/5/2022, 6/1/2022 and 6/15/2022 I interviewed Chief Administratator(CA) 1 related\nto this complaint. CA 1 also provided clarification information related to the complaint\nvia email on other dates as reported in the methodology section of this report. CA 1\nreported that on 7/15/2021 HBC had “Foreign Actors” to break into their techology\nsystem. The Foreign Actors stole all of their files and held them for ransom. HBC\ndiscovered there was a problem after staff tried to turn on computers to access the\nagency’s system, and could not do so. CA 1 said they contacted their IT(Information\n4",
    "Techology) Department/Provider; IT Person 2. IT Person 2 advised them, HBC’s server\nhad been hacked.\nCA 1 reported the server that was hacked was their old system. She said, they were in\nthe process of converting to a new server and “most of all that was on the old system\nwas on the new server”. CA 1 reported HBC worked with their insurance company, by\nway of a “Threat Management Company”(TMC) hired to perform a forensic review of the\nsystems/files. She said the system’s lock out happened on a Friday; and due to HBC\nhaving the new server, which the Foreign Actors did not realize, HBC was able to be\nback up and running by Tuesday of the next week. She reported at that point they did\nnot know what was missing or touched related to the breach. She reported the server\ndata went back years, to 2013.\nCA 1 reported from the time of the breach, lock out, the TMC negiotated back and forth\nwith the Foreign Actors. HBC paid the $10,000-$12,000 ransom and it took about two\nweeks to get the key(code) so as to allow HBC back into their system. The TMC had to\ngo through each file to let HBC know what the Foreign Actors may have seen or\ntouched. The TMC reported HBC should air on the safe size, they should assume all the\nfiles may have been exposed. It took the TMC months to get through the 384 possible\nexposures. The TMC also provided intensive server monitoring for the first three\nmonths. The server monitoring is now through HBC’s IT Provider.\nCA 1 reported there being 14 names, some are foster children, some are staff( the\nexact number for each was not reported by CA 1) that they could not find addresses\nfor. She was unable to provide me an exact number of foster or adoptive children or\nfamilies the breach related to. She reported the legal analysis of who requires notice of\nthe incident under Michigan law is still underway, as they continue working to collect\nmissing address information. She reported that based on the information gathered to\ndate, there were 65 individuals known to be associated with MDHHS that were\nimpacted by this incident and required notice under Michigan’s data breach notification\nlaw.\nI advised CA 1 that based on their 4/28/2022, and 1/7/2022 letter to MDHHS(which\nHBC provided to me on 5/5/2022), HBC’s reporting of the incident to MDHHS did not\nappear timely with respect to the” Loss or Compromise of Data” section HBC’s\ncontracts. I asked her for clarification, as to why she believes it was timely. CA 1\nreported HBC’s attorney reviewed the contract to assure that reporting deadlines were\ncompliant. She repeated much of what she previously reported about HBC working with\nthird-party forensic specialists after learning of the incident. The purpose was to\ninvestigate the potential incident and secure their systems; and for the team to conduct\nan extensive programmatic and manual review of the potentially impacted data. She\nreported while the investigation did not reveal any evidence that data were stolen from\nthe environment during the attack, the Foreign Actors may have viewed certain files on\nHBC’s systems. She reported the third-party data review process was completed on\nJanuary 5, 2022. Upon receipt of the results of the third-party review, HBC reviewed the\ndata file to determine whether any MDHHS data was potentially impacted. She reported\n5",
    "that until they had an understanding of what data was impacted from the results of the\nthird-party review, they were unable to determine whether any data associated with\nMDHHS individuals was impacted. On January 7, 2022, as part of HBC’s review of the\nthird-party data review results, they first determined that personal information related to\ncertain minor children who received services from HBC pursuant to the contract with\nMDHHS may have been accessible. They provided preliminary notice to the department\nvia MDHHS-Contract Administrator X that same day on January 7, 2022. CA1 reported\nthe attorney used the “Loss or Compromise of Data” section of the contracts to make\nthe determination that their reporting of the breach was timely. She reported all\ninformation she provided in letters to MDHHS or email proof to me is information,\nadvisement, or wording directly from their attorney.\nCA 1 provided the following statement about the timeframe they used for reporting the\nincident:\n “We identified the following provision (Section 4.31(e)) in the contract between\nHBC and MDHHS: “Loss or Compromise of Data: In the event of any act, error,\nor omission, negligence, misconduct, or a breach on the part of Contractor that\ncompromises or is suspected to compromise the security, confidentiality, or\nintegrity of State Data or the physical, technical, administrative, or organizational\nsafeguards put in place by Contractor that relate to the protection of the security,\nconfidentiality, or integrity of State Data, contractor must, as applicable: Notify\nMDHHS as soon as practicable but no later than 24 hours of becoming aware of\nsuch an occurrence.”\n That while HBC identified the suspicious activity in July 2021, HBC was not able\nto confirm if the incident impacted any MDHHS data until it conducted a thorough\nreview of the data that was identified by the investigation as potentially\naccessed. Put another way, until the third-party data review was complete, and\nHBC could review the output of that third-party review, HBC did not know if any\nstate data was lost or compromised and, thus, could not confirm if the contract\nprovision was triggered. HBC promptly reviewed the results of the third-party\ndata review and determined on January 7, 2022, that data affiliated with MDHHS\nservices and the contract between MDHHS and HBC was impacted. HBC\nnotified MDHHS on January 7, 2022, within 24 hours of determining that\nMDHHS-related data was impacted\nOn 5/13/2022 I interviewed HBC’s IT Provider, IT Person 2. IT Person 2 reported he is\nan HBC subcontractor, and the agency’s IT person. He affirmed CA 1’s reporting that\nHBC had a system’s break/hack, and information was held for ransom. He reported the\ninsurance company assumed nothing was taken. That the entity just locked the system\ndown, so it could not be accessed; and the actor(s) could conduct the ransom.\nIT Person 2 reported HBC had a 2008 software server system that used a dumb\nterminal to connect to the server. He said the agency was completing a 2016 upgrade\nwhen the breach happened. He said that was in June or July of 2021. IT Person 2\nreported the 2008 system had firewall/ security system protection, but the protection in\nthe 2016 system has greater protection. With the upgrade they put in a 90-day\n6",
    "password expiration; and tighter security at the firewall to reduce remote access (like\nfrom home) without a two-factor identification. He said Microsoft has lots of defaults and\nthey changed somethings. They gave all staff new remote log in access. He reported\nwhen the system attack happened, the staff could not work for about one to two weeks;\nbecause they had to get, the 2016 server online; new security passwords for staff; and\ntransfer everything from the old server system to the 2016 system. He reported the HBC\nserver did not connect to the State’s system. Staff’s connection to the State’s system\nwas via a web browser and a two-factor identification.\nIT Person 2 reported the agency’s server contained the agency’s word processing\ndocuments, information from the State, such as memos. IT Person 2 reported when\nthey did a deep dive assessment, it was more like memos related to foster\ncare/adoption, but “no personal information that could be used to harm someone. The\nword processing did not have children’s or foster home/adoptive home names or\nanyone’s personal information.” He was not sure whether any children were affected by\nthe breach. He acknowledged he was not sure what would have been contained in all\nthose emails or word documents. He reported of all the documents (emails, word\ndocuments, PDFs) the insurance company (TMC) did not find anything to show a\nbreach of information requiring a third-party notification. He reported all HBC’s\ninformation was received back from the hackers. He reported per the insurance\ncompany full social security numbers, full ID numbers or case numbers were not there\nthat associated with MDHHS. He said the agency should have a Final Analysis Report\nof the incident from the insurance company. IT Person 2 reported he had not seen, nor\nwas he aware of HBC’s contract requirements related to reporting information to\nMDHHS related to data breaches. He reported the agency may have notified the\ndepartment in July 2021. He connected that with HBC staff being unable to work for that\none-to two-week period.\nReviewed:\n The 4/28/2022 letter from HBC to MDHSS-Contract Administrator X-the basis for\nthis complaint, as reported earlier in this report.\n A copy of a 1/7/2022 letter from HBC’s CA 1 to MDHHS- Contract Administrator\nX, regarding preliminary notice of the data event. The letter indicated that: On or\nabout 7/15/2021 HBC became aware of unusual activity related to certain files on\ntheir computer systems when they discovered certain files were encrypted with\nransomware (“The Incident”). Additionally, that working with counsel and a third-\nparty forensic investigation firm HBC immediately launched an investigation into\nthe nature, and scope of the unusual activity. The forensic investigation\ndetermined certain information was potentially accessible as a result of the\nincident. While the investigation did not reveal evidence of data staging or data\nexfiltration/theft, it determined that certain files and folders may have been\nviewed or accessed by the unauthorized actor. Also as reported elsewhere in\nthis report, this letter indicated a third-party document review commenced and\nwas completed. The results were provided to HBC on 1/5/2022; and on 1/7/2022\nHBC determined that personal information related to certain minor children who\nreceived services from HBC, pursuant the contract HBC has with MDHHS, may\n7",
    "have been accessible. This letter indicated HBC would be providing written\nnotification to all affected individuals.\n HBC’s Foster Care and Adoption Contract- with specific notice of:\n Section 4.31, e. titled State Data under subsection, “Loss or Compromise\nof Data”, that indicated “In the event of any act, error, or omission,\nnegligence, misconduct, or a breach on the part of Contractor that\ncompromises or is suspected to compromise the security, confidentiality,\nor integrity of State Data or the physical, technical, administrative, or\norganizational safeguards put in place by Contractor that relate to the\nprotection of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of State Data,\nContractor must, as applicable:\n 1)Notify MDHHS as soon as practicable but no later than 24\nhours of becoming aware of such an occurrence.”\n 4.33, a. Data Privacy and Information Security, that indicated the\ncontractor is responsible for establishing and maintaining a data privacy\nand information security program, including physical, technical,\nadministrative, and organizational safeguards, that is designed to·\n 1)Ensure the security and confidentiality of the State Data;\n 2) Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security\nor integrity of the State Data;\n 3)Protect against unauthorized disclosure, access to, or use· of the\nState Data;\n 5) Ensure that all employees, agents, and subcontractors of\nContractor, if any, comply with all of the foregoing. In no case will\nthe safeguards of Contractor's data privacy and information security\nprogram be less stringent than the safeguards used by MDHHS, and\nContractor must at all times comply with all applicable State IT\npolicies and-. standards, which are available to Contractor upon\nrequest.\n8",
    " A Letter of a summary of HBC’s cybersecurity incident from Attorney 3 of\nthe XX law firm received on 6/8/2022. This letter reported various\ninformation already explained by CA 1 related to the computer system\nbeing encrypted with ransomware and what the agency did thereafter. This\nletter named the law firm, as listed above, being retained by the agency, as\nwell as the name of the third-party investigation firm (Firm T), completing\nthe comprehensive forensic investigation. This summary indicated that\n“Immediately upon discovery of the event, HBC took the affected systems\noffline and rebuilt its domain controller. Firm T “collected and reviewed\navailable forensic evidence from HBC’s network and monitored HBC’s\nnetwork via an advanced endpoint detection and response (“EDR”) tool,\nCarbon Black, which was deployed on the servers within the environment.\nThe forensic investigation did not identify any evidence or signs of data\nexfiltration, such as the creation of zip files, archiving or staging data, or the\npresence or use of exfiltration tools or data transfer applications. However,\nthe forensic investigation did identify that compromised user credentials\nwere used to view certain files and folders on HBC’s network between\nFebruary 23, 2021, and July 16, 2021. Although there was no evidence that\ninformation was exfiltrated or stolen.” This letter summary further indicated\nthat HBC has no evidence of any identity theft or fraud in connection with\nthis Incident. Additionally, that to mitigate the impact of the Incident, HBC\npromptly executed a password re-set for all user accounts and\nimplemented multi-factor authentication for email use. As part of the\ncomprehensive response, HBC also notified the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) of this Incident and cooperated with its subsequent\ninvestigation and data requests.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12213 Record Management.\nAn agency shall do all of the following with respect to\nmaintenance of required records:\n(c) Store and maintain each record in a manner to ensure\nconfidentiality and to prevent unauthorized access.\n9",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency’s 2008 server was hacked and encrypted with\nransomware and certain children files were viewed or accessed.\nThree-hundred-sixty-four individuals were identified as being\nimpacted by this incident; 65, individuals were, known to be\nassociated with MDHHS, with some being children. The\nagency’s investigation of the security incident identified that\ncompromised user credentials were used to view certain files\nand folders on HBC’s network between February 23, 2021, and\nJuly 16, 2021.\nThere is insufficient data to conclude the agency’s electronic\nfiles were not in a manner to ensure confidentiality and prevent\nunauthorized use. The evidence showed the agency’s older\nserver system was hacked just as they were upgrading to a\ngreater 2016 cybersecurity system.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nContract 4.31 e. State Data\nLoss or Compromise of Data:\n“In the event of any act, error, or omission, negligence,\nmisconduct, or a breach on the part of Contractor that\ncompromises or is suspected to compromise the security,\nconfidentiality, or integrity of State Data or the physical,\ntechnical, administrative, or organizational safeguards put in\nplace by Contractor that relate to the protection of the security,\nconfidentiality, or integrity of State Data, Contractor must, as\napplicable:\n1)Notify MDHHS as soon as practicable but no later than 24\nhours of becoming aware of such an occurrence.\n10",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency did not report the breach timely as required by its\nMDHHS contracts. The contract standard does not indicate the\nagency has to know for a fact what State data was breached.\nIt indicates that the compromise to the security, confidentiality,\nor integrity of State Data or the physical, technical,\nadministrative, or organizational safeguards put in place by\nContractor, that relates to the protection of the security,\nconfidentiality, or integrity of State Data can be suspected. In\nthis incident when the agency became aware its system/ files\nwere encrypted with ransomware, a suspicious of compromised\ndata would be a reasonable conclusion; and the breach should\nhave reported prior to 1/7/2022. It was not.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date June 21, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 19, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n11"
