    "Allegation Youth was denied a doctor visit for stomach pain and was given\nmedicine instead. Youth was provided depression medication\nagainst parental wishes.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 8/21/24.\nComplainant reported Youth A has been having trouble sleeping,\neating, and his stomach has been bothering since being at the\nfacility. Complainant reported his face is sunken in and it looks like\nhe has lost weight. Complainant reported Youth A was begging to\ngo to the hospital for his stomach pain but was provided\nmedication instead.\nComplainant reported Nurse called her and apologized for not\ncontacting her prior to giving Youth A anxiety medication.\nComplainant reported Nurse told her Youth A had already had 7\ndoses, but Complainant told Nurse not to give him anymore until\nshe could investigate the medication and decide. Complainant\nreported Nurse stopped the medication and informed her Youth A\ncould also refuse the medication at any time in the future.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/22/24.\nYouth A reported a week ago, he was having stomach pain and\nthrew up, but his stomach kept hurting. Youth A reported he was\ncrying and complaining in his room. Youth A reported multiple staff\n(couldn’t remember who) came to check on him and asked him\nwhat he needed. Youth A reported he told them he needed to go\nto the hospital, but all the staff did was encourage him to eat.\nYouth A reported he tried to eat 3 different times, but his body\nwouldn’t let him. Youth A reported he was left in his room the rest\nof the day with no relief. Youth A reported the following day he\nsaw Nurse, and he was prescribed a medication to help with\nstomach acid. Youth A reported after 2-3 days, he stopped taking\nit because he didn’t feel it was helping. Youth A reported his\nstomach pain lessened while taking the medication, but it was still\non and off a bit. Youth A reported the stomach pain had been\nhappening on and off since before he was placed at the facility.\nHe stated he had gone to a doctor one time to address it, but he\ncouldn’t remember what the doctor said about it, what he did for\nhim, or how long the pain had been happening.\nYouth A reported he was seen by Nurse on another occasion, and\nhe was prescribed an anti-depressant for anxiety. Youth A\nreported he had never been on the medication before. Youth A\nreported he thought his mom approved the medication but found\nout later she didn’t. Youth A reported he stopped taking the\nmedication about 2 days ago because he said it wasn’t helping\n2",
    "anything. Youth A reported Nurse told him it would take 2 weeks\nto take effect, but he didn’t want to wait that long for it to work, so\nhe stopped taking it.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/22/24. Supervisor reported on or about 8/16/24, Youth A had\nwritten a letter to his girlfriend stating he was going to try to break\nout of the facility. Later that same day, Youth A began complaining\nabout having stomach pains. Supervisor reported Youth A had\nonly been at the facility for 5-6 days and had only been eating\nsmall bites of food each day. Supervisor reported Youth A said he\nwas starving himself because he would rather die than be at the\nfacility. Supervisor reported when Youth A was complaining about\nstomach pains, he was screaming at her and demanding to go to\nthe hospital. Supervisor reported she asked him about his\nsymptoms, whether he had thrown up, what kind of pain it was,\netc. but he wouldn’t provide any information. Supervisor informed\nYouth A she couldn’t consult with medical professionals if he\nwouldn’t provide more information, but he still refused. Supervisor\nasked if he was nauseous, spoke to him about the possibility of\nanxiety, but he still didn’t provide any information. Supervisor\nreported she wasn’t willing to send him straight to the emergency\nroom without further information or consultation with medical\nprofessionals because of Youth A’s plan to break out of the\nfacility, which was disclosed earlier in the day. Supervisor reported\ndespite the lack of information, she contacted the on-call medical\ndoctor, who encouraged her to provide Youth A with a “sick tray”\n(Gatorade, popsicle, chicken noodle soup and crackers) since he\nhadn’t been eating much. Supervisor provided Youth A with the\n“sick tray”, and she told him he needed to eat all of it per the\ndoctor’s recommendation. Youth A chose to only eat the popsicle,\nand continued to complain about his stomach; however, Youth A\nfell asleep shortly after. Supervisor reported since Youth A fell\nasleep and was content, they didn’t do anything else medically\nthat night.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/22/24.\nNurse reported Youth A filled out a slip on 8/16/24 stating he was\nhaving stomach pain and vomiting. Nurse reported she met with\nYouth A and consulted with Doctor via text. Doctor said Youth A\ncould have one Tums once per day for three days, and prescribed\nOmeprezole/Prilosec for acid reflux. Nurse reported the\nprescription was filled on 8/19/24, so Youth A continued with one\nTums once daily (8/16/24, 8/17/24 and 8/18/24) until the\nprescription was filled.\n3",
    "Nurse reported on the same slip from 8/16/24 regarding stomach\npain, Youth A made a request for “Buspar”, which is short for\n“Buspirone”, which is an anti-anxiety medication. Nurse reported\nin speaking with Youth A, he stated he had previously taken the\nmedication prior to being at the facility. When Nurse met with\nYouth A, she believed some of his stomach pain was a result of\nanxiety because he had been very tearful and expressed a lot of\nconcerns about being away from his girlfriend and family. Nurse\nconsulted with Doctor and Doctor ordered a prescription for\nBuspirone (10 mg. twice per day), which was filled the same day.\nNurse reported Youth A took the medication from 8/16/24-8/18/24,\nrefused his dose in the morning of 8/19/24, but took his dose in\nthe evening of 8/19/24. Nurse reported he has not taken the\nmedication since 8/20/24 because Youth A’s mother requested\nYouth A stop the medication since it was provided without her\nknowledge or approval. Nurse reported she called Youth A’s\nmother on 8/20/24 to apologize to her and his mother was very\nangry. Nurse talked to Youth A’s mother twice that day to sort\neverything out, and his mother ended the conversation by stating\nshe didn’t know if she wanted Youth A to continue the medication\nand would call back later to provide her decision. Nurse admitted\nresponsibility for not calling Youth A’s mother for approval prior to\nstarting the psychotropic medication, and admitted it was her\nerror.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Monroe County Youth Center Medical request dated\n8/16/24 for Youth A states “stomach pain/vomiting and\nBuspar request”.\n• Youth A’s medication log notes Youth A took an Antacid\nonce daily from 8/16/24-8/18/24. It notes Youth A began\ntaking Omeprazole/Prilosec once daily from 8/19/24-\n8/22/24. It also notes Youth A took Buspirone starting the\nevening of 8/16/24 through the evening of 8/18/24, refused\nhis dose in the morning on 8/19/24, took his dose in the\nevening of 8/19/24, and took both of his doses on 8/20/24.\nIt notes Youth A has not taken Buspirone since 8/20/24.\n• Youth A’s prescriptions were viewed and match what is\ndocumented on the medication log as well as the\nprescription dates Nurse reported.\n• Consent for Treatment with Psychotropic Medications form\nfor Youth A dated 8/14/24 states Youth A wasn’t on any\nmedications upon intake.\n4",
    "• Receiving/Storing/Releasing Medication policy and\nDispensing Medications policy do not outline the process\nrequired for parental consent for beginning psychotropic\nmedications.\n• Email from Chief Administrator (CA) dated 8/27/24 states\nthe process for obtaining parental consent prior to\npsychotropic medications doesn’t appear to be outlined in\nany policies. CA noted the practice is leaving a voicemail\nfor a parent is not sufficient, and a conversation over the\nphone with a parent is required to provide verbal consent.\n• Juvie Specific Documentation form states verbal parental\nconsent is needed for any type of psychotropic medication\nchange or start. CA noted this form was provided to Nurse\non 6/24/24 via email for training purposes.\n• Medical progress note dated 8/20/24 at 14:30 authored by\nNurse describes the contact Nurse made with Youth A’s\nmother after she learned Youth A’s mother was upset about\nnot providing consent for the psychotropic medication to\nbegin. Nurse admitted to Youth A’s mother she\ninadvertently omitted calling her prior to starting the\nmedication.\n• Medical progress note dated 8/20/24 at 15:10 authored by\nNurse describes the follow-up contact Nurse had with\nYouth A’s mother after retrieving Youth A’s medication log.\nNurse also described the side effects, dosage, pros and\ncons about the medication.\n• Nurse does not have any disciplinary records in her\nemployee file. Nurse was trained on procedures related to\nmedication consent on 6/24/24.\nAnalysis The agency is found in violation as per interviews conducted and\ndocumentation reviewed, Nurse failed to follow the facility’s\nprocedure regarding obtaining parental consent prior to starting\nYouth A on a psychotropic medication.\nThere were no findings regarding the facility’s response to Youth\nA having a stomachache. They asked questions, contacted a\nmedical professional, and followed the medical advice.\n5",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is recommended the facility update their medication policies to\ninclude the process for obtaining parental consent for medications\nand specify which types of medications need consent prior to use.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10169 Discipline\nSection (1) A facility shall have and follow written policy and procedure\nDescription which stipulates that residents shall not be subjected to any of the\nfollowing: (a) Corporal or cruel punishment.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A has been slapped by two staff.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 8/21/24.\nComplainant reported she spoke with Youth A on the phone within\nthe last week and their conversation was being monitored by the\nfacility. Complainant reported Youth A wouldn’t talk a lot, so she\nasked him a lot of questions. Complainant reported it wasn’t clear,\nbut she believed Youth A stated 5-6 days prior to their\nconversation, Youth A was slapped by two staff. Complainant\nreported she did not get any other details and was unaware of the\nstaff’s names.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/22/24.\nYouth A reported he was never slapped or hit by any staff at the\nfacility.
