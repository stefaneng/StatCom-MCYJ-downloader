    "CCI Rule 400.4506 Fire drills and telephone\n(1) There shall be quarterly emergency fire drills for\neach staff shift. Two of the drills shall include\nevacuations, unless approved by the department, in\nwriting, as clinically contraindicated.

Written records shall be maintained for each\ndrill indicating the date and time of the drill and,\nwhere evacuation was a part of the drill, the\napproximate evacuation time.\nThe facility did not complete quarterly fire drills on each shift as required. For\nexample, all fire drills completed at Besser and Klare Cottages from January-April\n2025 were completed during 2nd shift, and all fire drills completed at Mary\nKatherine from January-July 2025 were completed during 1st shift.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The facility was provided with feedback and guidance for CAP\nrequirements and completion.\n• Fire drill logs must document whether an evacuation took place or not.\nEvacuations are required for at least 2 out of 4 quarterly drills. Evacuation\ntimes must be documented.\n• Fire drill logs must follow the same shift timeframes (Youth Care\nProfessional shifts) to ensure compliance.\n• The facility can complete monthly fire drills, but they need to still follow the\nquarterly requirements of completing them on different shifts. For example -\nhave a rotation such as 1st shift in January, 2nd shift in February, 3rd shift\nin March and continue from there.\n• Performance evaluations for new staff must be completed within 180 days\nof hire. They cannot cover a timeframe of 180 days but be completed after\nthe 180-day mark.\n• Provided guidance to the facility regarding training logs for new and\nseasoned staff. Training logs must include hours completed and there must\nbe an easy way to discern how many hours of training staff completed. The\ntracking spreadsheet is a great tool, but needs to include more detail and\ninformation.\n• Provided guidance and information regarding appropriate education\nprograms for youth. Youth must be enrolled in a program approved by the\nMichigan Department of Education.\n6",
    "• Prior technical assistance was provided to the facility regarding preliminary,\ninitial and ongoing service plans on 8/1/24, 9/16/24, and 1/9/25. However,\nthe facility did not follow the guidance provided and received violations for\nRule 153 and 154 as a result. Technical assistance was again provided to\nthe facility regarding service plan timeframes and requirements.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Provided the facility with feedback and suggestions related to\ncommunication and staff meetings based on information learned from staff\ninterviews.\n• Provided the facility with guidance surrounding completion of annual\ncentral registry clearances. The CWL-4624 is only required prior to initial\nhire and if a staff discloses CPS involvement while employed. For annual\ncentral registry checks, the CWL-1929 should be completed and sent to the\nlocal DHHS office for processing. The DHHS office will then send the CWL-\n1910 back to the facility, which shows the results of the check.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The first\nCAP (approved 10/25/24) was a result of the facility's 2024 Renewal Inspection\n(approved 9/4/24). The facility received a repeat violation for Rule 113(1)(i)\nregarding central registry clearances and a violation for Rule 120(1)(c) for hiring a\nsupervisor of direct care who didn't meet the requirements of the rule. To mitigate\nthese issues, the facility created an employee file audit form which required review\nand approval by the assistant director prior to the employee being hired. The\nfacility successfully implemented and completed this CAP.\nThe second CAP (approved 7/3/25) was a result of SIR#2025SIC0000680 (dated\n6/2/25) which had a violation for Rule 109(1)(c) due to a staff not following the\nfacility's code of conduct policy. The facility placed the staff on suspension and\nultimately terminated them. The facility committed to re-training staff on various\ntopics and policies including mandated reporter, confidentiality, code of conduct,\nprevention and reporting sexual abuse & harassment, employee handbook,\n7",
    "professionalism, etc. The facility is also having staff sign off on some of these\npolicies.\nThe third CAP (approved 8/20/25) was a result of SIR#2025SIC0000803 (dated\n8/6/25) which had a violation for Rule 142(1)(a) due to a staff not following the\nfacility's medical policy. The facility placed the staff on suspension and ultimately\nterminated them. The facility committed to conducting a workshop on incident\nreport training, restraining on medical reporting and incidents, and more oversight\nfrom shift leaders to ensure incident reports are completed and submitted.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's budget and 2024 financial audit were reviewed, and no concerns were\nnoted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported the program has substantially blossomed\nregarding nutrition, education, and daily living since November 2024. CA reported\nnutrition and food has become more personalized, and they request youth\nfeedback. CA reported the hardest part has been hiring bilingual staff to fill their\nopen staff positions.\nCA reported the program officially implemented an employee audit tool checklist\nthat included the Assistant Program Director as a second audit to the onboarding\ncandidate. If a deficiency was found, the program provided a new start date to the\ncandidate. That process ensured this rule and other new hire requirements were\ncompleted before the start date. This has been successful in ensuring compliance.\nCA reported this process also ensured no candidates were hired who didn't meet\nthe qualifications and requirements of their position. On 5/8/25 the program\nimmediately implemented staff code of conduct and professionalism policy training\nfor six months. The program also held a refresher training on Child Abuse and\nMandated Reporter, Confidentiality, Code of Conduct, Prevent and Report of\nsexual Abuse and Harassment, and Employee handbook acknowledgment policies,\nand take the ORR reporting and boundaries training. These CAP activities have\npresented the staff with continued policy and reporting refreshers to ensure policy\nis known and understood. On 6/19/25, The program implemented refresher incident\nreporting training during monthly All-Staff Meetings. These refreshers allow staff to\nroutinely hear the procedures and allow leadership to perform knowledge checks.\nOn 6/13/25, the Director of Operations, provided the program with the results of her\nunannounced monitoring visit on 5/25/25. This program self-assessment resulted in\nprogram improvements and/or oversight regarding Rules 136, 138, 149, and 506.\n8",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nDirector reported they're seeing longer lengths of stay for youth due to changes in\nsponsorships and the federal government, therefore they're exploring alternative\nways for youth to achieve their education requirements through online\nprogramming and GED achievement. Director reported they've seen strides in\nbasic foundations of care for the youth since January and they're continuing to\nimprove all services they provide. They improved nutrition for the youth and\nobtained youth input during youth council to ensure they're getting the food they\nwant and not so much food is wasted. They did an internal audit with the Director of\nSafety and Director of Operations, which gave them a baseline of where they're\ncurrently operating so improvements can be made going forward. Staff morale is\nincreasing, but there are still challenges at times. Staff have a passion for what they\ndo, and it shows when they're working. They're focusing a lot on the hiring process.\nThe program is currently approved by ORR to fill 40 youth beds, but once staffing\nincreases, they hope to increase to approval for 50 beds.\nAssistant Director reported it has been incredible to see the effects of smoothing\nprocesses out to becoming a more well-oiled machine. She reported they're\nfocusing a lot on training right now. She reported the two CAPs they've had have\nreorganized them to have a better standard of more refresher trainings and critical\nreminders regarding reporting, standards of conduct, etc. She reported this helps\nthe staff to have these topics on their mind more often, so compliance can improve.\nShe reported they are constantly telling staff over-reporting is better than not\nreporting. She reported they are seeing the progression of improved\ncommunication in that regard. She reported they have struggled hiring bilingual\nstaff, so they are working on expanding their recruiting efforts to have more\nsuccess.\nTeacher Assistant (TA) reported she loves seeing the students and bonding with\nthem. She enjoys seeing the youth learn English, and in turn, they're teaching her\nSpanish. TA reported training was really good and she learned a lot. She feels\nsupported by her team as well as upper management. She feels comfortable\nreaching out and asking questions or providing feedback as necessary. TA\nreported communication could be improved by preparing in advance if youth need\nto leave, have appointments, etc. She said recently a few youths weren't in class\nand she wasn't aware they were off campus, so it was confusing when she began\nteaching. She reported the staff are great with the youth and she's really impressed\nby the way youth and direct care staff bond with each other and build their\nrelationships. TA reported it's a stressful situation for the youth because they don't\nknow their plans or where they'll go next, so the patience they have while placed at\nthe facility is amazing. She reported staff are great at comforting and supporting\nyouth, so they have reassurance while at the facility.\n9",
    "Clinician reported she likes the culture, dynamic and purpose of working for the\norganization. She reported the support from the clinical team and relationships with\nstaff, and her supervisor are going well. She reported training was good, but a little\nchaotic because the trainer was still in training, so her training lasted longer.\nClinician reported she feels comfortable providing feedback and asking questions.\nClinician would like to see communication be improved if youth are at activities or\nvisits because clinicians have a limited time to meet with youth, and when they\ndon't know what youth are doing, it makes it hard to schedule.\nShift Leader (SL) reported things are going well at the facility. He reported training\nwent well, but ongoing training is necessary. He reported he feels supported in his\nposition. He reported everyone is a team, but communication needs to improve to\nensure the team functions correctly. For example, there needs to be improvement\nregarding communication when advocates come to meet with youth, there are\nmeetings with the consulate, appointments for youth, etc. He reported he feels\ncomfortable giving feedback, voicing concerns, and asking questions.\nYouth Care Professional 1 reported things are going well at the facility. She loves\nbeing involved with the youth and she's learning a lot of Spanish, which has been a\nfun aspect of working here. She reported communication could be improved\nregarding knowing about things before they happen. For example, there are\nprogress notes for each shift, but sometimes things happen throughout the day that\ndon't end up in the progress notes. Therefore, if youth are reactive or having a\ntough time, people don't know why. She feels supported in her position and feels\nthey provided the most thorough on the job training she's ever been through. She\nreported monthly staff meetings are productive, and she feels she can provide\nfeedback, concerns and ask questions as needed.\nYouth Care Professional 2 reported she likes working at the facility, likes her team\nand likes leadership. She reported she loves working with the kids and learning\nabout their different backgrounds and personalities. She reported communication\ncould be improved. For example, information will be provided to one person, then\nwill skip over the direct care staff, and be told directly to the youth. She feels direct\ncare staff don't get the information needed, especially if their shift leader isn't\npresent that day. She reported sometimes they aren't notified of youths'\nappointments, court hearings, etc. which is frustrating. She reported she feels\nsupported in her role but sometimes she feels she doesn't know what's going on\ndue to the lack of communication. She reported training went well initially and they\nhave refresher trainings every 2 months, which is helpful. She reported she feels\ncomfortable providing feedback, concerns and asking questions as needed.\nYouth reported staff treat them well and they have staff they can talk to if needed.\nYouth reported the food is good and they get enough to eat. They all reported\nfeeling safe at the facility and did not have any concerns or things they didn't like.\n10",
