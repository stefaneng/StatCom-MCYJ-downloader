INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection (1) The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty\nto perform the prescribed functions required by these\nadministrative rules and in the agency’s program statement\nand to provide for the continual needs, protection, and\nsupervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Three residents pierced body parts with a paper clip.\nInvestigation The referral source was the facility, Director. She reported that\nthe three female residents who are on a pod together pierced their\nnoses with a paper clip. The girl residents are on a pod together\nwith no other residents. The residents deny they planned to do\ntheir piercings together or at the same time and date and it was\ndone without the others being aware.\nI interviewed Youth A on 6/5/23 face to face at the facility. She\nreported that she re-pierced her belly button with a paper clip that\nshe obtained from Case Manager P’s office. Youth A reported that\nCase manager P was aware she took the paper clip. Youth A\nreported that she took the metal nose piece from a face mask that\nshe found on the ground in the gym and placed it in her belly\nbutton to keep the piercing open. Youth A had the metal in her\nbelly button for 4-5 days she reported before it was discovered.\nYouth A reported she pierced her belly button in her room with the\nshade pulled up so nobody could see in her room. Youth A\nreported she lied to staff and said she was going to the bathroom\nwhen she was really re-piercing her bellybutton.\nI interviewed Youth B face to face at the facility on 6/5/23. She\nreported she got 3 paperclips from Case Manager P's office floor.\nYouth B indicated Case manager P was sweeping her floor and\nher door to her office was open and she and Youth A took 3 paper\nclips each off her floor.

She reported she pierced her nose during that time.\nShe indicated she sat on the edge of her sink and was able to\npierce her nose with nobody seeing her. Youth B also took a small\n2",
    "piece of the metal paper clip and placed it in her nose to keep the\nhole open. Youth B reported her nose piercing was not noticed\nimmediately as she always wears a mask, and it concealed her\nnose for a few days. Youth B reported the nurse came down when\nthe girls’ piercings were discover and looked at them and provided\nantibiotic cream for the pierced areas. Youth B reported she did\nnot know who was on shift the day she pierced her nose.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/5/23.\nYouth C reported she is going to be released in a couple days and\nshe decided to re-pierce her nose as she wanted it open for when\nshe was out of the facility. Youth C reported she was not aware\nthe other girls were piercing themselves and she did this in her\nroom during reflection time which is between 1:45pm and 2:30pm.\nYouth C reported they do room checks every 15 minutes during\nreflection time and she had her shade up and said she was using\nthe bathroom. Youth C refused to say how she got a paperclip to\nre-pierce her nose but indicated it was not from Youth A or Youth\nB and that she got it from a staff member. She would not say who\nthe staff member was that provided the paper clip. Youth C\nreported she cleaned the paperclip and her nose with soap and\nwater and sanitizer before piercing it.

Case manager P reported the\ngirls have indicated they got the paperclips on her office floor, and\nshe was not aware they did this. Case manager P denied ever\ngiving the youth or being aware of the youth taking paperclips\nfrom her office. Case manager P reported she asked the girls if\nthey had a pact to do this and they denied having a pact or\nknowing what each other was doing. Case Manager P reported\nthe girls were recently moved from Lincoln Center to Calumet and\nshe was sweeping her new office floor and the girls stopped by\nand talked to her during this time. There were some paperclips on\nher floor that she was sweeping up.\nI interviewed Youth Worker 1 on 6/16/23 over the phone. She\nreported she noticed the resident’s piercings the morning she\nopened their doors. Youth Worker 1 reported she told her\nsupervisor immediately. Youth Worker 1 reported she told the girls\n3",
    "they can't put things in their bodies that are not sterile, and they\ncould get an infection. The girls all refused to take the metal out of\ntheir noses and stomach. Youth A and B reported they got the\npaper clips from Case Manager P’s office and Youth C denied to\ntell her where she got the item to re-pierce her nose. Youth\nWorker 1 reported that Youth C told her she is cool with Youth\nWorker 2 and she got the item to re-pierce her nose from Youth\nWorker 2 the night before.\nI interviewed Youth Worker 2 on 6/16/23 via the phone. Youth\nWorker 2 no longer works at the facility. She reported she was at\nwork the day that the resident’s piercings were discovered. She\nreported Youth A showed her the belly button piercing and she\nhad no idea how Youth A did the piercing. Youth Worker 2\nreported she told her supervisor when it was discovered. Youth\nWorker 2 denied knowing how the three female residents did their\npiercings. She denied ever providing Youth C or any of the youth\nwith things they could pierce themselves with. Youth Worker 2\nreported if she had known the girls were going to do such a thing\nor saw them doing it, she would have stopped them.\nYouth Worker 3 and Youth Worker 4 were called, and they did not\nanswer or return the phone call.\nRoom check logs were reviewed from 5/31/23 during personal\ntime. The residents were checked on five times between 1:45pm\nand 2:33pm when they were in their rooms for personal time.\nThere is no documentation indicating the youth were observed\npiercing their body parts or that they had their shade up or down\nduring this time.\nAnalysis Based upon interviews there is no evidence that supports the staff\nwere not able to provide for the needs, protection and supervision\nof the residents. All three-youth admitted to having their shade up\nand reporting they were using the bathroom to conceal what they\nwere doing. There was no way for the staff to know what the girls\nwere doing while in their rooms. Room checks were being done as\nrequired but the youth had their shades up for privacy and\nindicated they were using the restroom.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n6/16/23\n______________________________________\nTracey Ventola Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 27, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
