CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period. A special evaluation initiated on 2/11/2021 determined the foster\nparents did not provide adequate supervision and did not follow an established\nsafety plan that resulted in a foster child being sexually abused. The foster parents\nwere substantiated for abuse and neglect and the license was recommended for\nrevocation. The agency’s findings and recommendation were found to be\nappropriate based on the information obtained during the investigation.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period. A special evaluation initiated on 2/11/2021 determined the foster\nparents were tying a foster child to a chair as a form of discipline. The family was\nfound to be in violation of licensing rules and agency policy. The agency pursued\nrevocation due to another incident that resulted in the foster parents being\nsubstantiated for abuse and neglect.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period in response to the 2021 Renewal\nInspection Report. During this period under review the agency expressed the\nimpact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on overall compliance. In addition, the\nagency noted that staff turnover and retention impacted overall compliance. Four\ncitations were noted as repeat violations in the current inspection.\n9",
    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment reported the agency’s difficulty in meeting\nrequirements during this review period. The assessment reported the previous year\nCAP was helpful, specifically with licensing. The agency has had some struggles\nduring this review period due to COVID-19. In addition, the Chief Administrator (CA)\nreported the agency has had difficulty hiring and maintaining staff. The assessment\nnoted a shortage of qualified applicants. The CA indicated that virtual training has\nbeen difficult for new staff. In addition, restrictions due to COVID-19 have been a\nbarrier to meeting requirements. The CA reports that agency processes will continue\nto be updated and reviewed with staff to ensure expectations are clear.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff acknowledged that this\npast year has been challenging due to COVID-19 but felt as though the agency had\nadapted well during the previous year. Staff reported feeling supported by supervision\nand available as needed. Staff did report that staff morale could be better but felt as\nthough that was not due to the agency and was common at other agencies.\nVI. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\n___________2/1/2022______\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 2, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
