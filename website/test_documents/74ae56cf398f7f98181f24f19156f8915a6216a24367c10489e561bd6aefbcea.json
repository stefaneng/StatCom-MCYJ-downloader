    "II. ALLEGATION:\nViolation\nEstablished?\nThe agency did not initiate the process of adding an adult live- Yes\ntogether partner to a foster home license in a timely manner\nIt was alleged the agency failed to complete timely clearances and assessments\nto add FP 1’s live-together-partner to an active license.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n03/31/2021 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0108030\n03/31/2021 Special Investigation Initiated - Telephone\nNotified CA of the allegation; requested a chronological summary\nof events; CA denied FP 1 was ever dishonest with the agency\nabout her relationship\n04/01/2021 Contact - Document Received\nRec'd requested information\n04/02/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nConsulted with DCWL Consultant 1\n04/02/2021 Contact - Telephone call made\nPreliminary exit with CA\n04/08/2021 Exit Conference\nWith CA\nALLEGATION:\nIt was alleged the agency failed to complete timely clearances and assessments\nto add FP 1’s live-together-partner to an active license.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDCWL received this complaint on 3/31/21 from an anonymous source.\nThe following is a list of events in chronological order:\n2",
    "5/23/19 FP 1 informs agency that her boyfriend may be moving in.\n5/24/19 Agency receives a clear criminal history of boyfriend\n5/30/19 Boyfriend’s child abuse clearance comes back clear and he is added as a\nsubstitute caregiver for FP 1\n7/31/19 Boyfriend moves into the foster home\n7/31/19 Ichat is rerun and comes back clear\n8/06/19 Agency continues what they believe is the process of adding boyfriend to the\nfoster home license\n10/9/19 Agency receives boyfriend’s child abuse clearance from the state of Ohio\n1/15/20 Boyfriend gets fingerprinted\n6/16/20 Agency requests and receives application with both signatures\n6/18/20 Agency sends fingerprints and signed application to DCWL for processing\n7/15/20 Agency requests boyfriend submit a mental health assessment\n9/25/20 Mental Health assessment of boyfriend completed\n10/28/20 Agency learns boyfriend’s fingerprints are positive for criminal hit(s) and an\nART is required.\n11/7/20 FP 1 and boyfriend marry\n03/29/21 Agency completes an ART on FP1’s husband and sends it to DCWL\nFP 1 notified Wolverine that her boyfriend may move in. Wolverine ran criminal and\ncentral registry clearances to add him as a household member before he moved in.\nThe clearances came back clear.\nBased on current protocol, an ichat and central registry clearance is sufficient to\ndetermine the suitability of a new household member. However, an additional level of\nprotection is needed for when adding one’s name to an existing license in a 2-caregiver\nhousehold. That requires a signed application and finger printing.\nOnce FP1’s boyfriend moved in, FP 1 identified him as a substitute caregiver.\nWolverine sent him to Orientation and Pride Training, a step that they believed\n“continued the process” of adding him to the license. However, Wolverine did not begin\n“the process” at that time because the first step in the process is to sign an application.\nTA manual – pg 19 indicates:\n“In a two-caregiver household, both caregivers must sign the application. This would\ninclude a husband and wife; a married couple where both individuals are the same\ngender; two adult living together partners, regardless of gender; or two other adults who\nwill share the caregiver role.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12308 Application submission.\n(2) An agency shall require both caregivers in a 2-caregiver\nhousehold to sign the application.\nANALYSIS: Wolverine waited nearly one year after FP1’s boyfriend moved\nin to submit an application signed by the boyfriend. As FP1’s\nlive-together partner, the boyfriend should have signed the\napplication immediately after moving in.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nTechnical Assistance –\nI recommend the agency refer to the CPA TA manual to assist them and/or contact\ntheir assigned DCWL Office Consultant whenever they have questions related to\ntwo-caregiver households.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is submitted, I recommend the agency\ncontinue their current licensing status.\nApril 8, 2021\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 9, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
