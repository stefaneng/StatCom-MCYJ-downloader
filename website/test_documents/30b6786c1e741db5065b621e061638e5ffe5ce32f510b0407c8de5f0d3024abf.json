EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the CAP is as follows: The facility has\nsubmitted one corrective action plan during this reporting period. This CAP was in\nresponse to the special investigation (2025SIC0000294) with a finding of non-\ncompliance that is requiring a corrective action plan. The finding of non-\ncompliance involves a violation of COF Rule 400.10107 (Repeat Violation) with\nan allegation of a specific staff member allowing youth to watch pornography on a\ntelevision in their Pod. The corrective action plan involved the following action\nsteps. The staff involved was terminated from employment which is verified by\ndocumentation from the HR department. The Administrator oversaw the removal\nof all “smart” televisions from the facility and the replacement of “dumb”\ntelevisions which will be located so what is being viewed can be seen by the\ncameras on the Pods. This will be verified by on-site review by licensing. All staff\nare required to attend an updated Mandated reporter training at an all-staff\nmeeting. Any staff not able to attend will be required to attend individual\nMandated reporter training. To verify staff’s involvement in the training a sign-in\nsheet will be used and provided. The final action step involves the development\nof a new policy outlining a way to ensure staff fully understand their\nresponsibilities in being a mandated report. Once this policy is developed a copy\nwill be sent to licensing and incorporated in the training. At the time of this review,\nthere has not been adequate time to begin evaluating the CAP.",
