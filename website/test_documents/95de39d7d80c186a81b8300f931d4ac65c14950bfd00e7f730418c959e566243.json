The agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has done a great job at ensuring all PATP’s are signed and all medical\npassports are completed despite COVID restrictions. They have two repeat\nviolations, but the late entry of contacts was significantly less this year. The agency\nstruggled with the removal of several of their youth from CCI’s and expressed\nconcerns about the amount of staff time this took as well as the lack of support\nreceived from other units within the department.\nVII.

All four homes had positive\nthings to say about the agency and did not express any concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes, rules, and policy requirements. Upon receipt of an acceptable\ncorrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of\ntheir regular license.\n6/21/21\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 21, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
