    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the\nreevaluation. The placement specifications shall include all\nof the following:\n(a) Age,\n(b) Gender,\n(c) Race,\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family,\n(e) Characteristics of children best served by the home,\n(f) Children who may not be placed in the home. The\nchild's racial, ethnic, and cultural identity, heritage, and\nbackground may only be considered if an assessment of\nthe individual child indicates that such consideration is in\nthe best interests of the child.\nFive of the six foster home files reviewed did not include placement specifications\nconsistent with the current license (3706) for the home. Three had an inconsistent\nage range, one did not include the capacity for the home, and one only presented a\ngeneral statement stating the terms were the same without identifying the specific\nterms. The first example with an inconsistent age range had an age range on the\nlicense of 3-5 years and the age range in the most recent report dated 06/13/2019\nwas 3-6 years. The second example had a license age range of 7-10 years and the\nmost recent report dated 04/15/2020 recommended an age range of 3-9 years. The\nthird example had a license age range of 0-12 years and the report dated\n04/22/2020 recommended an age range of 0-2 years. The report age range for this\nexample was discussed in the exit conference and it appeared to be a typographical\nerror in the report. The one example indicating an inconsistent capacity had a\nlicense capacity of 3 and the most recent report dated 08/31/2019 did not include a\ncapacity in the recommendations. This is a repeat violation from the interim\nevaluation completed 07/26/2019.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers. If children are\ninterviewed, their last names shall not be included in the report.\n4",
    "Four of the four special evaluation reports reviewed contained the last names of\nchildren placed in the home who were interviewed. This issue was discussed at the\ntime of the exit conference and may be a system related issue to be addressed by\nthe agency.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each child\nand parent or parents, as follows:\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and at\nleast once every 90 calendar days thereafter.\nOne of the eight current foster child records reviewed contained an updated service\nplan that was not completed within the time frame established by this rule. In this\nexample the ending date for the plan was 07/31/2019 and the plan was not\ncompleted until 08/19/2019. A total of 28 service plans were reviewed as a part of\nthis evaluation.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the\nfollowing:\nISEP 4.22 MiSACWIS (Commitment 22). DHHS will maintain an operational\nstatewide automated child welfare information system (“MiSACWIS”) which\nwill be the primary tracking system and satisfy federal reporting\nrequirements.\nExamples of information that sometimes could not be located in the system were\ncurrent Parent/Agency Treatment Plans, Signature Pages for PATP’s, and a couple\nUSP reports. The information that could not be located was the exception and not\ntypical of the maintenance of the information system by this agency. This is a repeat\nviolation from the interim evaluation completed 07/26/2019.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nDHHS Policy 722-06B page 1-7 Family Team Meeting\nThe Family Team Meeting (FTM) is an essential component of MiTEAM, Michigan’s\nChild Welfare Practice Model. FTMs serve as the primary forum for safety planning,\ncollaborative service planning, service identification, and assessing progress. The FTM\nrepresents a child-centered, family-driven, strength-based, team-guided approach,\ndesigned to engage families in developing plans for the safety, permanency and well-\nbeing of their children and family.\nFTMs should include child welfare staff, parents, caretakers, foster parents, children,\nyouth, and may also include extended family, friends, neighbors, community-based\nservice providers, community representatives, tribal representatives, for Indian children,\nor other professionals involved with the family.\nDuring the FTM, participants work together to create a plan for safety, placement, and\n5",
    "permanency tailored to the individual needs of each child. This process provides a\nforum to share ideas and opinions and stresses the importance of the family’s\nperspective and involvement. In addition, this process encourages full participation of all\nparticipants, honest communication, and promotes dignity and respect.\nType Time Frame\nUpdated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar days before the case plan due date.\nFour of the eight current foster child records reviewed contained at lease one service\nplan that was developed without a timely FTM being completed as required by this\npolicy for the completion of a new service plan. The first example did not have a\ndocumented FTM for the time period ending 02/14/2020. The second example had a\ndocumented FTM for the time period ending 09/16/2019 that was completed\n09/18/2019. The third example did not have a documented FTM for the time period\nending 01/19/2020. The fourth example did not have documented FTM’s for the time\nperiods ending 08/16/2019 and 02/12/2020 as required by this policy.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas\nV. CONSULTATION\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nSafety Concerns\nThe safety concerns of the analysts will be documented in an addendum to this report.\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan for the interim evaluation\ncompleted 07/26/2019. Areas identified in noncompliance as a part of that\nevaluation were R 400.12205 (8), R 400.12324 (4)(e), (8), R 400.12326\n(1)(b)(f)(g)(h), R 400.12327 (6)(c), (7), R 400.12405 (4), DHHS Policy FOM 722-\n08C, and ISEP 4.22. The only areas identified as repeat noncompliance as a part of\nthis renewal evaluation were R 400.1234 (4), and ISEP 4.22.\n6",

Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n05/11/2020\n________________________________________\nMark R.
