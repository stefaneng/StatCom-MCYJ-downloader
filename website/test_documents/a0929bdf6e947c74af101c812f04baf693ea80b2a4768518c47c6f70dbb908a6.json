    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth's mental health medication needs are not being met due to a lack of medical\nprofessional on duty. Youth has not been able to get new glasses.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received and investigated jointly with the DHHS Specialist. The\ncomplaint reported additional concerns that are not within the purview of DCWL and\nwere not investigated and thus, not reported on in this report. The initial complaint\nnoted the following, “Youth A (16) is currently in placement at Methodist Children's\nhome Services. Youth A has not taken any of his mental health medications\nbecause there are no nurses or medical staff on duty. Youth A needs new glasses,\nhowever because there is no medical staff on duty, he is unable to obtain new\nglasses.”\nI interviewed Director 1 at the facility, on 11/18/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nDirector 1 is the Director of Residential Services. Director 1 said that if a youth had\nbroken glasses, they would tell the Nurse. However, Director 1 reported that the\nformer nurse left the facility a couple of weeks prior, and they are in process of hiring\na replacement. In the interim, Director 1 said that Director 2 is covering some of the\nduties that were coordinated by the nurse, such as making appointments and\nensuring medications are ordered. During this time, Director 1 said that youth can\ntell staff of any needs and the staff are to report the needs to their supervisor, who\nwould then notify Director 2.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Therapist on 11/18/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. The\nTherapist reported having worked with Youth A for about one month and noted that\nindividual sessions occur weekly. The Therapist said that Youth A declined two\nsessions due to not feeling well (one stomachache and one headache) so she did a\nbrief check in with Youth A instead of a full session. The Therapist said that Youth A\nhad not reported any broken glasses to her or that he was not getting his\nmedication. The Therapist reported no concerns.\nI interviewed Director 2 at the facility, on 11/18/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nDirector 2 is the Director of Children’s Services. Director 2 denied knowing that\nYouth A’s glasses were broken and noted that if she had known, she would have\nmade an appointment for them to be repaired or replaced. Director 2 stated she has\nseen Youth A three to four times over the last week or two and he had not\nmentioned his glasses breaking and had not mentioned that he was not getting\nmedication. Director 2 said that she has been checking on medication weekly for any\nyouth with concerns and checks medications monthly for youth with no concerns.\nDirector 2 said that she started overseeing the medication and medical components\nwhen the former nurse resigned. This was reported to have started right before\nHalloween. Director 2 said that she is familiar with the requirements of what needs to\nbe done, as she used to supervise the nursing staff prior to some organizational\nrestructuring in July. When asked about the three open entries on Youth A’s\nmedication administration record, Director 2 said that there should not be open\n3",
    "entries. Director 2 did not know why the option of “physically unable to take” was\nselected on the forms.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility, on 11/18/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nWe met with Youth A right after he returned from school. Youth A reported that he\naccidentally broke his glasses on Monday, 11/15/21, the same day that his worker\ncame to visit. Youth A said he dropped them after school. Youth A said that he told\nhis worker and told Staff 1 (he thinks) on the same day or the next day. Youth A said\nthat no one had come to talk to him about the glasses yet. Youth A said that he had\nnot told anyone else, including Director 2 or his Therapist, even though he had seen\nthem. Youth A further reported that he has not been given one of his morning\nmedications, and thought it was medication Z. Youth A reported how he is doing well\nin the program and was recently seen for a medication review where they lowered\nsome medication dosages, including medication Z being lowered 20mg. Youth A\nsaid that no one told him why he was not getting medication Z, and he had not\nreceived it for about the last week and a half. Youth A said he always takes his\nmedication and does not refuse, except if he does not need something like his nasal\nspray or inhaler. Youth A’s medication logs were reviewed with him, with emphasis\non medication Z. It was observed that medication Z had previously been\nadministered at 20mg twice a day and it changed to 20mg once daily. Youth A\nreported that he didn’t realize that the lowered dose resulted in him not receiving one\nof the pills and he thought he was not being given the medication. Youth A reported\nthat this now made sense to him.\nI met with Director 1 again on 12/06/21. Director 1 said that she checked with staff\nand found that they had not entered medication counts into the computer system,\nwhich caused an error when staff tried to document that they gave medications. It\nforced an error code to have to be entered and one of the options is “physically\nunable to take.” Director 1 said that the staff opted for this entry to be able to move\nforward in the system and continue passing medications. Director 1 said that when\nmedications are delivered, the staff are to enter the new counts in the computer\nsystem. It was reported that third shift usually does this and the supervisor on third\nshift is the secondary counter. Reportedly, some staff said that this has been an\nissue since the nurse left, while others said it was longer than that. The Director said\nthat the medications were being given but documented this way due to the error\ncode required. On 12/21/21, Director 1 reported that Youth A’s glasses had been\nsent in for repair but were not back yet.\nI met with Staff 1 and Staff 2 (separately), on 12/08/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Both staff were asked about the entries of “physically unable to take” that\nthey entered on some of Youth A’s medication administration logs. Both staff\nprovided congruent accounts as noted by Director 1. Due to staff not logging in the\nnumber of new medication when received, an error was triggered in the computer\nsystem and forced the staff to choose a code from a drop-down list. Both staff said\nthat they had administered the medication but chose that code so that the computer\nsystem would allow them to move on to the next item. Both staff said that they could\n4",
    "not go back and fix the counts. Both staff also noted that they documented this in the\ndaily log.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Youth A’s medication administration records for the months of September,\nOctober, and November 2021 were reviewed on 11/18/21.\no Medication Z was observed to have changed from 20mg twice daily to\n20mg once daily on October 26, 2021. All documentation for\nadministration of medication Z was present.\no The November form was observed to have missing documentation for\nadministration (blank entries) on the 13th, 14th, and 16th, for\nmedication C.\n Facility’s medication administration policy\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nANALYSIS: There is no evidence to support the allegations that Youth A\nwas not provided routine medical care related to the\nrepair/replacement of his glasses. The glasses broke on the day\nthe complaint was made and Youth A had not even reported to\nthe facility that they were broken, which allowed no time for\nthem to know or act on the information. Additionally, through\nreview of Youth A’s medication administration records and his\nown report on changes to his medications, it was found that he\nwas receiving his medication, but that the dosage of one\nmedication changed, which resulted in one pill rather than two.\nThis was just a misunderstanding by Youth A.\nThe facility did violate the rule, however, as during the review of\nthe medication administration records, it was observed that staff\ndid not document administering medication C on November 13th,\n14th, or 16th, as those entries were left blank.\n5",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt was additionally found that the staff were not always following\nthe proper methods for recording medication in the computer\nsystem, which forced an error code for dispensing medication\neven when the youth had received the medication. The staff\ndispensing medications then had to select an error code\n(physically unable to take) to continue in the system, rather than\nbeing able to choose the correct option of having passed the\nmedication. By all accounts, the youth received the medication,\nhowever, the facility must increase supervision of this process\nwhile they hire another nurse to ensure that medications are\nbeing administered and documented correctly. The\nadministration must also stress to staff that if there are errors\noccurring, to notify the supervisor.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0108004 - intake 11/04/21; CAP approved 12/01/21\n2021C0219034 - intake 04/26/21; CAP approved 06/15/21\n2021C0219016 - intake 12/04/20; CAP approved 03/01/21\n2020C0108024 - intake 01/22/20; CAP approved 02/19/20\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nDecember 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
