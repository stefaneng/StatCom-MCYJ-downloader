    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster Care worker disclosed Biological Mother's confidential\nmedical information to Relative Caregiver without her consent.\nInvestigation Biological Mother was interviewed via telephone on April 25,\n2025. She stated her children were removed from her care in July\n2022 and placed with Relative Caregiver 1 & Relative Caregiver 2.\nShe stated in August/September 2022 she was pregnant and\nhospitalized. One week into the hospital stay she delivered a\nstillborn baby. She had planned on letting Youth A know about the\nbaby during her next parenting time. She stated Youth A had been\nvery excited about the new baby and talked about another sibling\nall the time.\nBiological Mother stated within one week of her baby being\nstillborn Relative Caregiver 1 & Relative Caregiver 2 were\nmessaging her and referenced the stillbirth. She wondered how\nthey knew and reached out to Foster Care worker (FCW) and\nasked how they knew since that was not something she had\ninformed them of. She stated FCW reported she was under the\nimpression they already knew and told them herself. She stated\nshe bought a new phone since that time and does not believe she\nstill has the messages but will look.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via video\nconference on May 1, 2025. She stated she has been the\nassigned FCW since the foster care case opened in July 2022.\nShe stated Biological Mother had been in the hospital for an\nunknown reason in August/September 2022 and there was a\nperiod of time FCW wasn’t able to locate her. She was eventually\nnotified by Biological Mother’s mother who reported she needed to\nbe petitioned into the hospital for mental health treatment. While in\nthe hospital, Biological Mother lost her unborn baby.\nFCW stated Biological Mother ended up contacting FCW after\nabout 3 weeks of not being able to locate her. Biological Mother\ncalled FCW while still hospitalized and told her what had\nhappened, and she lost her baby. There was discussion regarding\nYouth A being upset about the baby and a plan was discussed\nregarding the best way to tell her. The decision was made to tell\nher about the loss of the baby during a session with Youth A’s\ntherapist with Biological Mother present. FCW reported Biological\nMother had informed her it was ok to discuss with Relative\nCaregiver 1 & Relative Caregiver 2, who had placement of Youth\nA during this timeframe, for the purpose of scheduling the therapy\nsession and informing the therapist.\n2",
    "FCW stated she had a conversation with Relative Caregiver 1 &\nRelative Caregiver 2, as discussed with Biological Mother, and\nasked them to schedule a therapy appointment for Youth A and\nBiological Mother so Biological Mother could inform her of the loss\nof the baby.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on May 1, 2025. She stated Biological Mother lost her\nunborn baby in late summer 2022. Biological Mother had given\nconsent for FCW to disclose the information to Youth A’s therapist\nat New Oakland as well as Relative Caregiver 1 & Relative\nCaregiver 2 in order to coordinate services and set up an\nappointment so Youth A could be notified in a therapeutic setting.\nFC supervisor stated Youth A is young and has been participating\nin counseling services since she was removed from Biological\nMother in 2022. At the time this occurred the therapist required a\ncaregiver to be in the room during sessions due to her age. She\nclarified the caregivers did not participate in sessions but were\nrequired to be present. FC supervisor stated Biological Mother\nwas aware of that requirement and had given consent so FCW\ncould coordinate the counseling appointment for Biological Mother\nand Youth A once Biological Mother was released from the\nhospital.\nRelative Caregiver 1 & Relative Caregiver 2 were interviewed\nvia telephone on May 20, 2025. Relative Caregiver 1 had the call\non speaker phone and Relative Caregiver 2 also participated in\nthe interview. She stated she recalled learning Biological Mother\nhad lost her baby, but she was adamant it was not FCW who\nreported the information to them. She stated this took place a few\nyears ago and could not recall who had disclosed the information\nto them but was sure it was not FCW. Relative Caregiver 1 stated\nthey were already aware that Biological Mother had lost her baby\nby the time FCW mentioned it to them. Relative Caregiver 1\nclarified they were working with FCW to schedule a counseling\nsession for Youth A so Biological Mother could be present and\ninform Youth A of the news herself in a therapeutic setting.\nRelative Caregiver 1 stated at the time Biological Mother lost the\nbaby in late summer 2022, Biological Mother was allowed to call\ntheir home to speak with her children who had been placed in their\ncare. Biological Mother called their home and asked to speak with\nYouth A. During the phone call Youth A walked into her bedroom\nand they were not able to hear the discussion. During the phone\ncall Biological Mother informed Youth A that she had lost the baby\n3",
    "and Youth A was very distraught. Relative Caregiver 1 stated she\nwas so upset with how she handled the situation after everyone,\nincluding Biological Mother, was in agreement to notify Youth A in\na therapeutic setting.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case.\nSeptember 6, 2022, social work contact: FCW asks legal\ndad what is going on with Biological Mother. Legal dad\ndisclosed Biological Mother had a miscarriage and lost her\nbaby.\nSeptember 8, 2022, social work contact: “Phone call to\nRelative Caregiver 1; Informed her about the situation\nregarding Biological Mother and the loss of the baby.\nRelative Caregiver 1 stated Youth A has her first\nappointment with her psychiatrist on September 14, 2022.\nDiscussed the best way to inform Youth A of the loss of the\nbaby; Agreed that Youth A's psychiatrist should be involved\nwith deciding the appropriate delivery method.\nSeptember 14, 2022, social work contact: Phone call with\nNurse Practitioner from New Oakland. Relative Caregiver 2\ninformed her Biological Mother lost her baby and discussed\nhow to appropriately deliver the news to Youth A.\nDiscussed the plan to schedule a therapeutic meeting with\nBiological Mother, Youth A and therapist.\nOctober 26, 2022, social work contact: Phone call with\nRelative Caregiver 2.

Relative Caregiver 2 reported he\nwent in Youth A's room to find her lying in bed and crying.\nHe reported Youth A eventually came up to him and told\nhim she knows her mom lost the baby. Relative Caregiver 2\nstated he is very frustrated that Biological Mother knowingly\ntold Youth A while FCW was working on setting up a\ntherapeutic visit between Biological Mother and Youth A to\ndeliver the information.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance. Both Biological Mother\nand FCW confirmed there was a telephone call between the two\nof them. Biological Mother reported she did not provide consent\nduring the call for FCW to provide her medical information to\nRelative Caregiver 1 and Relative Caregiver 2. FCW says\nBiological Mother did provided consent during the call. In review\nof the detailed social worker contacts and case file, there is no\ndocumentation that the telephone call occurred, nor consent was\nprovided.\n4",
