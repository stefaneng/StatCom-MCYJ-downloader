The agency\nwas advised to clarify on the 1105 report how participants attend.\n Service Plans- Some foster care files indicated completed USP reports.\nHowever, the report was not saved or “generated” to allow DCWL to open the\nfile for review. The agency was reminded to save generated reports, to allow\nothers to view the document in MiSACWIS.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation during this review.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nA special evaluation initiated on 11/30/20 determined the foster parent medically\nneglected a child in her home and did not provide adequate supervision. The foster\nparent was substantiated for abuse and neglect and the license was recommended\nfor revocation. The agency’s findings and recommendation were found to be\nappropriate, based on the information gathered during the investigation.\n13",
    "There was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nA special evaluation initiated on 3/18/21 determined the foster parents were utilizing\nspanking as discipline. The family was found to be in violation of licensing rules and\nagency policy. A Corrective Action Plan was implemented and the family is now\nback in compliance. The agency’s investigation of this matter and the approved CAP\nwere reviewed and found to be appropriate.\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nSIR 2021C0207011 was initiated on 3/10/21 regarding notification of a child death in\nan unlicensed relative home. The investigation determined the agency followed\nprotocols for child death notification. However, violations were determined for rules\n417(1) foster parent information, 418(2) development of service plans, and contract\nrequirements for a relative home study. A CAP was approved on 5/25/21 and\ncontinues to be implemented at this time.\nSIR 2021C0103026 was initiated on 6/4/21 due to allegations of a lack of\nreunification services, late service plans, and missing medical exams. The\ninvestigation determined violations of rules 206(2) staff qualifications, 418(2a)\ndevelopment of service plans, 413(1c) medical and dental policy, and contract\nrequirements regarding case planning, contacts, service plan approval, treatment\nplan signatures, family team meetings, and medical passports. A CAP was approved\non 8/23/21 and continues to be implemented at this time.\nThe findings of these two investigations are consistent with the violations found\nduring this renewal evaluation. The special evaluation CAPs and interim CAP will be\nreviewed for compliance during the next inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency’s difficulty in meeting requirements during this\nreview period. The Chief Administrator stated the previous year CAP was effective\nand there are good systems in place, but the increased staff turnover during the past\nyear has been disruptive. Also, some staff have struggled with COVID-19\nprocedures and working remotely without the typical face to face contact and\nsupport from peers and supervisors. In addition, hiring has been a struggle due to a\nlack of qualified applicants, leading to positions not being filled timely.\nThe CA indicated that training and support for staff and supervisors will be increased\nto aid in staff retention and fine-tuning job duties. In addition, the agency is\nimplementing protected time for staff, increased review of Infoview reports by\nsupervisors, and frequent evaluation of worker’s use of protected time to manage\ntheir cases effectively and provide support as needed. The CA expressed\nconfidence that several areas will improve over the next review period.\n14",
    "Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff on-site, as well as the program manager\nand a supervisor via video conference. Staff acknowledged this year has been\ndifficulty due to COVID-19 and staffing issues. However, they continue to adjust and\nanticipate improvement in many areas over the next several months. Staff reported\nfeeling supported by supervisors and reported no areas of need.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue\non a regular license.\nAugust 25, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 26, 2021\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n15"
