    "Rule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has ongoing\nDescription contact with children or parents to be a person who has the ability,\nexperience, education, and training to perform the duties\nassigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 1/11/24, foster care worker put their hands over the face of two\nfoster youth and pushed them back. The worker told the foster\nyouth to get out of the area while they were trying to talk to\nanother foster youth. An adult sibling in the home witnessed it.\nThere was also an additional foster care worker present when this\noccurred.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Staff 1 with State Worker 1 on 1/23/2024. Staff 1\nstated she was involved in a home visit and interviews with\nchildren in the home. Staff 1 stated two other children were in the\nroom and an adult sister was in the doorway of the room Staff 1\nwas attempting to complete an interview. Staff 1 stated she asked\nthe other children to leave the room so Staff 1 could conduct the\ninterview, but the other children were reluctant to leave. Staff 1\nstated she attempted to prompt the other children to leave by\nputting her hands on the shoulders of the other children to guide\nthem out of the room. Staff 1 stated Witness 1 started to yell that\nStaff 1 was pushing the other children. Staff 1 stated she only\nwanted to close the door so there would be privacy for the\ninterview. Staff 1 denied pushing the children or that the children\nwere injured as a result of Staff 1's physical contact with the\nchildren while attempting to guide them out the door. Staff 1\nreported she did not have a good working relationship with the\nfamily prior to this incident. Staff 1 stated she had already\nsubmitted a 4 week notice of resignation from her position with\nthis agency prior to this incident and the agency subsequently\nterminated her employment early following this incident.\nI interviewed Witness 1 with State Worker 1 on 1/29/2024.\nWitness 1 described the incident similar to Staff 1 except Witness\n1 described Staff 1 as putting her hands on the face of the\nchildren instead of the shoulder.\n2",
    "I interviewed Parent 1 with State Worker 1 on 1/29/2024. Parent 1\ndid not observe the incident, but Parent 1 reported they did not\nhave a good working relationship with Staff 1 prior to the incident.\nParent 1 stated she does not have an issue with the new worker\nwho replaced Staff 1.\nI interviewed Youth A with State Worker 1 on 1/29/2024. Youth A\nstated they were not hurt and didn't cry as a result of the incident\nof physical contact by Staff 1.\nI interviewed Youth C with State Worker 1 on 1/29/24. Youth C\nstated she did not want to talk with Staff 1 and reported the\nchildren were not injured as a result of the incident.\nYouth B and Youth D were not interviewed due to their young age\nand limited level of involvement in the incident.\nI interviewed Staff 2 and Staff 3 by telephone on 1/31/2024.\nNeither Staff 2 nor Staff 3 observed Staff 1 pushing/having\nphysical contact with the children at the time of the incident. They\ndid indicate there were no reported injuries to the children as a\nresult of the incident.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by telephone on 1/23/2024.\nAdministrator 1 stated the agency has a policy that workers are\nnot to have physical contact with the children. Administrator 1\nstated Staff 1 was subsequently dismissed following this incident.\nI requested Administrator 1 to send me the agency's policies and\nprocedures related to this issue.\nThere were no findings in the investigation completed by State\nWorker 1.\nDocuments Reviewed\nThe policies/procedures were received from Administrator 1. A\nreview of the written policies did not indicate a specific prohibition\nfrom any physical contact with the youth by a case manager.\nAgency training – Behavior Management and Discipline Policy\nAnalysis The findings of this investigation indicate compliance with the\nwritten policy of the agency. It is apparent from the interviews with\nthe staff members that the agency encourages staff members to\nnot have physical contact with children, but the written policy does\nnot include this specific prohibition.\n3",
    "There were no findings in the investigation completed by State\nWorker 1.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n2/22/2024\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n3/5/2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n4"
