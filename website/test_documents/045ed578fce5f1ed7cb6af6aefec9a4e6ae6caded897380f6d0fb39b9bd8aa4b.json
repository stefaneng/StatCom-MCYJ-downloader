Staff 1 reported he worked on 12/26/2023 with\nYouth A and Youth B and was the only staff on second shift. Staff 1\nreported there was a call in for the morning shift and the on-call worker\nwho was scheduled to work with him, came in and worked the morning\nshift and so he was the only staff working the second shift. Staff 1\nreported over the holidays at the facility it was like “working on an island\nalone” as there were no staff working at the main office and minimal staff\nat the two houses.

Staff 2 went into\nYouth A’s bedroom and addressed with Youth A how Youth A knew the\nrules had changed that day and provided negative points for Youth A not\nbeing honest. Staff 2 reported Youth A took the negative points well\nwhich is out of character for Youth A. Staff 2 then asked to hear who\nwas on the phone at which time Youth A was telling the person on the\nphone to say her workers name. Staff 2 asked the individual on the\nphone their name and it was a male voice. Staff 2 ended the telephone\ncall. Staff 2 reported the protocol now for Youth A to have telephone\ncalls is to be in the den, staff dial the phone number and verify who they\ncall, then give the phone back to Youth A.
