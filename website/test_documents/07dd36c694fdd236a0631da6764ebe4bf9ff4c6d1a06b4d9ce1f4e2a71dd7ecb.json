At no time have the\nsupervising agencies parenting and sibling visit policies been\nfollowed prior to the PPH on 7/19/2023. Not only has the minimum\namount of parent and sibling times been followed, but the\nnegligence also goes beyond that and has been a serious\ndetriment to not only the children themselves but the relationships\nbetween the mother and the children. In addition, it has been a\nserious detriment to the relationship between the children as\nsiblings. FCW worker makes false statement in her reports that\nare given to the Court/Judge. She states falsely that, \"sibling visits\nare happening according to law\".\nInvestigation Review of case history in MiSACWIS. The children (8) in this\nallegation range from the ages 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, and 13. The children\nwere removed from their parents’ home on 6/29/2022, due to\nalleged improper supervision, physical abuse, physical neglect,\ndrug exposed infants and substance use. The parents’ home has\nbeen involved with 14 different investigations with DHHS since\n2014. Currently, the children are placed with relatives and\nunrelated relative foster homes. The children are located in\nMcMillian, MI., Escanaba, MI., Sault S. Marie, MI. and Newberry,\nMI. The permanency goal is adoption per court order of\n7/20/2023.\nComplainant was interviewed on 9/19/23 via telephone. She\nreported basically the same information in the allegation and/or\ncomplaint.

The\nComplainant sent this Consultant an email where she disclosed\ninformation and policies regarding DHHS not following DHHS\ncontract policies. It was explained to the Complainant prior in a 2-\nhour conversation with her that DCWL does not regulate DHHS\npolicies and that DCWL regulate the violations of Child Placing\nRules.\nFoster Care Worker was interviewed on 9/1/2023 via TEAM\nconference. She reported that beginning with June 29, 2022, the\nJudge ordered DHHS to provide one visit per week per child with\ntheir parents. However, the court understands that with the\nnumber of children in this family, the distance of each placement\nand the amount of travel for DHHS workers, he is ordering less\nfrequent visits then DHHS policy states at the time. It was noted\nthat the children during that time was place in McMillian, MI.,\nEscanaba, MI., Sault S. Marie, MI., and Traverse City, MI. Foster\nCare Worker provided the barriers for the sibling and parental\nvisits. She reported the barriers as winter weather in the Upper\nPeninsula, lack of transportation, lack of high -speed internet, and\nthe distance between placements. The Foster Care Worker broke\ndown the distance as following:\n• Youth A was placed with his father from August 2022-\nOctober 2022 in Ishpeming Michigan for a total of 232\nmiles round trip to Newberry, Michigan.\n• In October 2022, Youth A’s father signed a POA to\nmaternal grandmother who resided in Traverse City\nMichigan. This is a 390-mile round trip to Newberry,\nMichigan.\n• Youth B is placed with her father in Escanaba Michigan.\nThis is a 226-mile round trip to Newberry Michigan.\n• Youth C is placed with her father in Sault Ste Marie\nMichigan. This is a total of 130-mile round trip to\nNewberry, Michigan.\nThe Foster Care Worker reported that DHHS provided gas cards\nto support parenting and sibling visits to both mother and relatives.\nShe said these were provided on many occasions.\nThe Foster Care Worker presented the social work log contacts\nthat included sibling visits and parenting visits between the\nparents and the siblings. She reported during this time frame only\none visit was missed on 7/23/22. She said the sibling visit was\nattempted to be scheduled at the Besse Park in Escanaba\n3",
    "because the caregivers were going to Escanaba to go shopping.\nShe said one of the caregivers asked if the siblings could get\ntogether on this day as they would be in Delta County. She said\nshe texted the caregivers of four of the children for a sibling visit\nbut, none of the caregivers were available to meet at the park with\nthe caregiver who requested the visit for this day.\nThe Foster Care Worker reported that at a court hearing dated\n7/19/23 the biological mother can have supervised visits with\nYouth A only. She said the court order was filed for termination of\nthe parents right and the permanency plan now is adoption.\nDocument Review:\n• Placement History\nYouth A – (4 placements) Relative – 6/27/23\nYouth B – (2 placement) Licensed unrelated foster home -\n8/7/22.\nYouth C – (3 placement) Licensed unrelated foster home -\n8/5/22.\nYouth D – (2 placement) Licensed unrelated foster home –\n7/28/22.\nYouth E – (1 placement) Licensed unrelated foster home -\n6/29/22.\nYouth F – (1 placement) Licensed unrelated foster home –\n6/29/22.\nYouth G – (4 placements) Relative – 7/17/23.\nYouth H – (2 placements) Relative – 7/17/23.\nDHHS Visitation plan for the Children and parental visits:\n• The visitation plan created on 6/29/22, for visitation type\nwere supervised visits, phone calls, and sibling visits.

Visits take place at a local park,\nlocal DHHS office depending on the weather.\n• It is noted the court allowed parenting time visits for Youth\nA effective 7/20/23 only. There was a reason for exception.\nThe judge ordered DHHS to provide one visit per week per\nchild with their parents. The court understands that with\nthe number of children (8) in this family, the distance of\neach placement and the amount of travel for DHHS\nworkers, he ordered less frequent visits then DHHS policy\nstates at this time.\nMiSACWIS Visitation Social Work Contact Log of sibling\nvisits:\n4",

Monthly in-person sibling contact is required\nunless…. the distance between the sibling’s placements is\nmore than 50 miles and one child is placed with a relative.”\nAnalysis Based on the documentation reviewed and the foster care worker\ninterview, it is not determined that the agency is in violation with\nthe rule. As noted, the siblings had numerous sibling visits\nbeginning with their removal on 6/29/22. Based on the Updated\nservice plan dated 4/25/23 – 7/23/23, the children had parental\nvisits with their biological mother. Currently, the biological mother\ncan only have visits with Youth A and they are supervised visits.\nYouth A as of 7/26/23, has moved back to Newberry to be closer\nto his siblings and mother. Although the Division of Child Welfare\nLicensing does not regulate DHHS policy, in this instance this\nagency is in compliance with DHHS Policy FOM 722.061 and the\nrule.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted following allegations that the Chippewa/Luce/Mackinac County DHHS failed to follow required visitation policies for eight siblings in foster care and their mother from June 2022 onward. The investigation, which reviewed case history, interviewed the complainant and the foster care worker, and examined documentation, found numerous documented sibling and parental visits and noted that the court had ordered less frequent visits than policy due to the large number of children and significant geographical distances between placements. The report concludes no violations of licensing rules were established. Although the agency faced logistical challenges, the investigation found it complied with the relevant rule and internal policy regarding visitation.",
