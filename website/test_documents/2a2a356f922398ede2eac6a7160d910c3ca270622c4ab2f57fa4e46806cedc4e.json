    "CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents and the foster\nparents in the development of service plans to enable the parent or parents\nand foster parents to understand the plan for the child and the parents' and\nthe foster parent's role in assisting the agency in carrying out the plan. An\nagency shall give a copy to and review the parent-agency treatment plan with\nthe parent or parents and foster parents. The agency must inform the parent\nor parents and foster parent that the information in the parent-agency\ntreatment plan and any other information about the child and the child's family\nis confidential.\nTwo of Eight open files of youth in foster care placements reviewed did not contain\ndocumentation of all PATPs being provided to/discussed with parents/caregivers.\nCPA Rule 400.12421 Visitation and family time; in person contact\n• (2) An agency social service worker shall visit the foster child, and the foster\nparent, if applicable, in the child's placement at least once every month.\nOne of Eight open files of youths in foster care placements contained social work\ncontacts documenting the foster parent was not present for all monthly foster home\nvisits with the youth.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10/29/2024 Renewal, CAP Approved 11/20/2024\nCPA Rule 400.12502 Program statement\n• (2) An agency shall give a copy of the program statement to a youth before\nplacement in independent living.\nOne of Three open files of independent living youth did not contain documentation\nof the youth being provided with the agency IL program statement prior to\nplacement in IL.\nCPA Rule 400.12503 Policy and procedures\n• (3) An agency shall provide a youth in independent living with a copy of the\nagency's policies and procedures required by this rule.\nOne of three open files of independent living youth did not contain documentation of\nthe youth being provided with the agency's IL policy and procedures prior to\nplacement in IL.\n3",
    "CPA Rule 400.12511 Termination\n• (2) An agency shall ensure and document that each youth who ends\nindependent living is provided with all the following:\n• (a) Basic information about health, housing, counseling and mental\nhealth services, and emergency resources.\nOne of Two closed files of independent living youth reviewed did not contain\ndocumentation that the youth was provided required information at case\nclosure(nothing in closing 69 or final case contact).\nCPA Rule 400.12511 Termination\n• (2) An agency shall ensure and document that each youth who ends\nindependent living is provided with all the following:\n• (b) A birth certificate.\nOne of Two closed files of independent living youth reviewed did not contain\ndocumentation that youth was provided birth certificate at case closure (box not\nchecked on closing 69, not documented in case contact).\nCPA Rule 400.12511 Termination\n• (2) An agency shall ensure and document that each youth who ends\nindependent living is provided with all the following:\n• (d) The youth's funds and personal property.\nOne of Two closed files of independent living youth reviewed did not contain\ndocumentation that youth was provided all funds and personal property at case\nclosure (box not checked on closing 69, not documented in case contact).\nCPA Rule 400.12511 Termination\n• (1) When an agency terminates its independent living services for a youth,\nthe agency shall document all the following information in the case record\nwithin 30 calendar days of termination of its services:\n• (c) A summary of the services provided during care and the needs that\nremain to be met.\n4",
    "One of Two closed files of independent living youth reviewed did not include a\nsummary of services provided (that section of closing 69 is left blank).\nCPA Rule 400.12511 Termination\n• (2) An agency shall ensure and document that each youth who ends\nindependent living is provided with all the following:\n• (c) A social security card.\nOne of Two closed files of independent living youth reviewed did not contain\ndocumentation that youth was provided social security card at case closure (box not\nchecked on closing 69, not documented in case contact).\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Licensing rules require workers/supervisors to receive 16 hours of orientation\nafter initial appointment and before assumption of assigned duties. The topics\nthat must be covered during orientation are outlined in the same rule. Many of\nthese are agency specific. For any caseload carrying staff, the orientation hours\nmust be completed prior to receiving a caseload, as that would be the\nassumption of their assigned duties.\n• When completing SER's in CWLM ensure the correct boxes are checked and the\ncorrect dates are entered regarding the verbal summary of findings.\n• When documenting family's SOGIE preferences in adoption and foster home\nfamily reports, ensure you are being specific and addressing all aspects of\nSOGIE (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression.)\nExamples : Open to youth who identify with any sexual orientation. Are not open\nto youth who identify as transgender or non-binary. Not open to any SOGIE other\nthan heterosexual youths who identify as the gender they were assigned at\nbirth/cisgender. Only open to youth who identify as gay, lesbian, or heterosexual.\nOpen to any gender identity and gender expression. Open to youths of any\nSOGIE.\n• In report section regarding pets in the home, be sure to document the worker's\nassessment based on their observations/interactions to ensure safety. One\nreport reviewed documented the foster parent reported the dogs were friendly.\nThe only assessment made by the worker was that the dogs bark loudly upon her\narrival. Another report reviewed stated the dogs \"are very overprotective of the\nchildren.\" This statement should be clarified as this has a negative implication.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• When onboarding staff utilize a consistent method of documenting orientation\nhours and topics.\n5",
    "• If caregivers or youths are not cooperative with home visit and or documentation\nrequirements, workers must document their efforts. For example, if a family\nconsistently refuses to check the applicable boxes and sign a PATP indicating\nthey have received and reviewed the plan, the worker must document in SWC\nhow the PATP was provided and when/how the PATP was reviewed with the\nfamily. A family/youth's consistent failure to comply does not negate the need for\nconsistent, thorough documentation.\n• During monthly supervision with staff and during service plan reviews,\nsupervisors should be reviewing case contacts to ensure workers are\ndocumenting face to face meetings with youths and caregivers in the caregiver's\nhome as well as document quality contacts. Some contacts reviewed did not\nhave all participants added to the contact and did not have enough narrative to\ndetermine who was present. Multiple contacts reviewed would not meet quality\ncontact standards required by MDHHS policy.\n• The majority of PATPs reviewed with caregiver and/or parent signatures were not\nsigned by the worker and supervisor. When asking someone to sign a legal\ndocument, the document should be the current approved and signed document.\nThis is verified by the worker and supervisor signing prior to the other\nparticipants. Generating and signing the case service plans and PATPs at the\ntime of approval would negate the need to collect the signatures later.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere was 1 incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. The one special evaluation report, dated 1/30/2025, in which a\nnoncompliance related to corporal punishment was established was reviewed.\nBased on coordination with MDHHS and consultation with DCWL, the agency's\nrecommendation of a CAP was appropriate.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The first\nCAP was submitted in response to the 10/29/2024 licensing renewal inspection\nreport. That CAP was approved on 11/20/2024 and addressed four violation; one\nrelated to personnel records in which two of fourteen files were found in violation\nof timely completion of criminal history checks, one related to face to face visits\nwith youth and caregivers in the caregivers home located in one of eight files\nreviewed, one related to independent living contracts being updated and signed\nevery 90 days located in three of eight files reviewed, and one related to adoption\nfamily assessments being completed timely located in one of six files reviewed.\nThe CAP was monitored for six months during which CAP compliance was\ndetermined. The agency has demonstrated that CAP was effective overall as only\n6",
    "one violation addressed in that CAP was repeated during this year’s inspection.\nThis year, ten violations were established which have not been established in the\npast two years. Five of those violations were located in one closed independent\nliving youth file, two were located in one open independent living youth file, two\nwere located in two open foster care files, and the remaining violations were found\nin four open foster home files. The significant increase in number of violations this\nyear is, in part, attributed to one rule violation including five subsection violations.\nNo pervasive patterns of violations were identified.\nThe second CAP was submitted in response to licensing special investigation\nreport 2024SIC0001511 dated 8/30/24. The CAP was approved on 11/1/2024 and\naddressed a violation of licensing rule 400.12325(1). The CAP was monitored for\na six-month period during which it was determined the agency was in compliance\nwith all action steps identified.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment dated 10/1/2025 was reviewed and discussed\nduring the entrance meeting. The chief administrator identified several actions the\nagency took to improve new staff training and support. The agency experienced a\nperiod of full staffing and stability; however, recently, they have experienced foster\ncare worker turnover. Some of the staff turnover was related to staff self-\nidentifying inability to perform the requirements of the job while others were related\nto poor performance identified by leadership.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's financial audit for the year ending on December 31, 2024, was\nreviewed. No financial concerns were identified.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe staff members interviewed all reported it has been somewhat hectic as of late\ndue to staffing turnover and caseload shifts. They all reported getting good support\nfrom direct supervisors, the program manager, and the agency director. They\nindicated the agency has kept new worker caseloads at 11, which is helpful as\nthey learn the job. No concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency has adequate space and equipment to provide the delivery of foster\ncare, independent living, and certification services. Physical CHRI is stored\nsecurely within a dedicated locked cabinet, and a cross shredder is located next to\nthe physical CHRI. All other foster care, independent living, foster home, and open\nadoption files are stored securely in a file storage room. Closed adoption files are\nstored in a separate locked cabinet in an area separate from all other files to\nprevent unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified.\n7",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nOctober 22, 2025\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 22, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
