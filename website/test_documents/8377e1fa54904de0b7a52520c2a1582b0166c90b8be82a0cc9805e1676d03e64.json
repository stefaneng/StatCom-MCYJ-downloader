Caregiver E said, Worker 3 told the court she kicked\nParent C out of a doctor’s visit for Child A, which was not true.\nCaregiver E reportedly showed a note from the doctor’s office\nindicating it was the nurse not her who had asked Parent C to\nleave the room. Complainant X reported Caregiver E stated she\ndid not believe she was given permission to supervise medical\nappointments, but Worker 3 allowed Parent C to attend the\nappointment without approval. Caregiver E did not report to\nComplainant X whether Worker 3 had the aforementioned\ndoctor’s note nor whether Worker 3 had it at the time of Worker\n3’s testimony in court.\nAdministrator 2\n2",
    "On 11/9/2023 I spoke with Administrator 2 about the allegations\nby telephone. She reported Worker 3 and Supervisor 4 would\nbe best to address this allegation.\nWorker 3 & Supervisor 4\nOn 11/13/2023 I interviewed Worker 3 and Supervisor 4\nseparately by video conference via TEAMs. Administrator 1 was\nalso present as a support person during each staff person’s\ninterview.\nWorker 3 admitted there was an incident whereby Parent C\nwas not allowed in Child A’s doctor’s visit; and only Caregiver E\nand Caregiver E’s daughter (who reportedly wants to adopt\nChild A) were allowed to stay in the exam room. Worker 3\ndenied the allegations. She said she did not give false\ninformation about the situation in court. She acknowledged\nreceiving a note from the child’s doctor’s office about the\nmedical visit. She said the doctor’s office only indicated they\nonly allow two people to be in the exam room. It was Caregiver\nE who made the call about who stayed. That it was Caregiver E\nwho indicated to the doctor’s office which two people it would\nbe, her and her daughter. Worker 3 reported Parent C is\nallowed to be aware of and to attend Child A’s medical\nappointment. The court has not ordered against this.\nSupervisor 4 reported Parent C and Grand Mother H go to all\nof Child A’s medical appointments. During one visit, they were\nasked to go wait in the waiting room while Caregiver E and\nCaregiver E’s daughter met for Child A’s examination. Worker\n3 had contacted the doctor’s office, and the doctor reported it\ncould only be two people. Supervisor 4 reported there was\nconcern Caregiver E may not have been encouraging Parent C\nto be in the exam room. That when Worker 3 was reporting on\nthis situation in court Caregiver E became upset. Caregiver E\nfelt Worker 3 was trying to make it seem as though Caregiver E\nhad lied. Worker 3 was reporting to the court information she\nhad assessed about the situation. No false testimony was\ngiven.\nCaregiver E\nI interviewed Caregiver E by telephone on 11/17/2023.\nCaregiver E reported attending a court hearing via Zoom, at\nwhich time Worker 3 told the court Caregiver E asked Parent C\nto leave a doctor’s visit; but that never happened. Caregiver E\nsaid Worker 3 reported Caregiver E should have advocated for\nParent C. Caregiver E said the doctor’s visit was on 7/7/2023,\n3",
    "and attended by her, her husband, her daughter, Parent C and\nGrand Mother H. This was the first medical visit attended by\nParent C and Grand Mother H. Caregiver E said she thought\nthey all could go in the back for Child A’s medical visit; but a\nnurse came in and told them only two people who care for the\nchild could come into the exam room. So, she and her daughter\nwent to the back for the exam. Caregiver E said she just\nfollowed the nurse’s instructions. She denied telling Parent C\nthat Parent C could not come to the back with Child A for the\nexam. Caregiver E did not say why her daughter was in\nattendance at the visit or why she did not explain to the nurse it\nwould be okay for her and Parent C to go back for the exam.\nCaregiver E reported due to Worker 3’s false information in\ncourt about this matter, she obtained a letter from the doctor\nshowing it was the doctor not her who prevented Parent C from\ncoming to the exam room for that doctor’s visit. She emailed a\ncopy of the letter to the attorney.\nDepartment Worker F and Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) G\nDepartment Worker E and GAL G were interviewed by me via\ntelephone on 11/21/2023 and 12/5/2023 respectively.\nDepartment Worker F admitted attending Child A’s court\nhearings. She said she only vaguely recalled Worker 3\ntestifying in court that Caregiver E asked Parent C to leave a\nmedical visit. Department Worker F did not know whether\nWorker 3 was reporting false information or whether Worker 3\nhad direct information that what Worker 3 was reporting was not\naccurate. Department Worker F reported only knowing\nCaregiver E was upset after the court hearing; and contacted\nher via email in August. Caregiver E reported she had told\nWorker 3 she had not kicked Parent C out the doctor’s visit; and\nshe would get a letter from the doctor showing that.\nGAL G recalled Worker 3 reporting in court that Caregiver E\nblocked Parent C from a medical appointment. He reported he\nhas no reason to believe Worker 3 was reporting false\ninformation or knew she was reporting incorrect information.\nDocument review:\nChild A’s case record which showed:\n• She was placed in an unlicensed relative placement with\nCaregiver E on 1/19/2023.\n• Child A’s mother, Parent C is a 16-year-old and resides\nwith her mother, Grand Mother H.\n4",
    "Analysis Based on interviews there is insufficient evidence to support\nthat Worker 3 gave false testimony in court. Nor that Worker 3\ndid not have the character, suitability and ability to meet the\nneeds of children and families served by the agency.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(b) Facilitating services and parenting time for children for\npurposes of reunification.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The foster care worker had not completed a home visit at the\nparental home before allowing visitation to occur in the home. The\nhome may not be safe for such visits. The home is heated by a\nbuddy heater. Additionally, the birth mother’s younger brother,\nwho lives in the home has threatened to kill Child A should Child A\nreturn to the parental home.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant X\nOn 11/6/2023 I interviewed Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X affirmed the allegations. Complainant X reported\nCaregiver E expressed concern that Worker 3 allowed Child A to\ngo for unsupervised visits with Parent C, when Worker 3 has\nnever been at the parental home. Caregiver E reported Worker 3\nadmitted that in court. Additionally, Caregiver E expressed\nconcerns about the safety and appropriateness of the parental\nhome for unsupervised visit for Child A due to the home being\nheated by a “buddy type heater” and that it may not have water.\nAdditionally, Parent C’s home is not adequate for unsupervised\nvisit due to a teen in the home threatening harm to Child A if Child\nA returns to the home.\nAdministrator 2\nOn 11/9/2023 I spoke with Administrator 2 about the allegations\nby telephone. Administrator 2 reported with the exception of the\nalleged complaint of a relative threatening Child A(which she had\nno knowledge of), all the reported concerns were explored before.\nAdministrator 2 reported there has been meetings with the\ndepartment related to matters reported by Caregiver E. She\nreported Caregiver E has been expressing concerns since the\nstart of the case with Eagle Village. Administrator 2 reported the\nagency has spoken with the caregiver about the concerns. That\n5",
    "Supervisor 4 has gone on home visits with Worker 3 so as to\nanswer Caregiver E’s concerns. The agency offered to have\nCaregiver E meet and talk with them about her concerns.\nAdditionally, the GAL G offered to talk with Caregiver E; and there\nhave been meetings with Caregiver E along with Department of\nHealth and Human Services (DHHS) to address Caregiver E’s\nconcerns. Despite these meetings Caregiver E’s concerns were\nnot satisfied. Caregiver E has not been completely cooperative, by\nrefusing to provide medical information to the agency related to\nthe child.\nAdministrator 2 reported Parent C’s home is not heated by a\n“buddy heater’, the home is heated by propane, and this was\nverified by the worker as recent as 11/2/2023. Administrator 2\nreported Worker 3 and Supervisor 4 could best address more\ndetails on all the allegations.\nWorker 3 & Supervisor 4\nOn 11/13/2023 I interviewed Worker 3 and Supervisor 4\nseparately by video conference via TEAMs. Administrator 1 was\nalso present as a support person during each staff person’s\ninterview.\nWorker 3 reported being the foster care worker for Child A’s case\nsince its assignment to Eagle Village on 1/19/2023. Worker 3\ndenied the allegations. Worker 3 reported Child A’s permanency\nplan was initially termination of parental rights. A court hearing\nwas held in April of 2023, and a permanency trial was to occur in\nJuly 2023. Children’s protective services and the court agreed to\ntake termination of parental rights off table for six months; and the\ncurrent permanency plan is reunification with Parent C. Worker 3\nreported she has continually worked with Parent C, and Caregiver\nE; inclusive of discussing the child’s permanency plan, reviewing\nservice plans and informing her about the status of the case. She\nhas also worked with Parent C on court ordered\nservices/requirements.\nWorker 3 denied Caregiver E contacting her about nonreceipt of\nany documents. She said Caregiver E complained to DHHS not\nEagle Village. Caregiver E complained to DHHS that Caregiver E\nthought Worker 3 was not taking Worker 3’s job seriously.\nCaregiver 3 wanted DHHS to take the case back from Eagle\nVillage.\nWorker 3 denied home visits not occurring to Parent C’s home,\nwhich is that of Parent C’s mother’s home. Worker 3 denied the\n6",
    "home not being safe for Child A to visit. She said prior to an\n8/2/2023 assessment of the parental home, and the court ordering\nunsupervised visits for Parent C the third week of October 2023,\nweekly visits (sometimes twice weekly visits, if concerns or issues\nwere reported) occurred. Worker 3 said the home visits included\nunannounced home visits. She said at the home visit on 8/2/2023\nthere had been a concern about no running water. She verified\nthere is running water. She said there was also no operable\nsmoke detector; and the floors were not clean. The family was told\nto clean the floors and to take care of the smoke detectors and\ncarbon monoxide devices. At Worker 3’s home visit that occurred\non 10/18/2023, she observed that the floors were clean, and she\nchecked for batteries in the detector(s). She said a standard\nsafety plan was completed with the family on 10/23/2023 when the\njudge ordered unsupervised home visits for Child A.\nWorker 3 reported the parental home has been very warm during\nher visits to the home. She reported having no knowledge of\nwhat a buddy heater is. She reported Parent C does have a space\nheater in Parent C’s room, which has not been in use during her\nhome visits.\nWorker 3 denied knowledge of any child in the home threatening\nto hurt Child A. No such a concern was brought up to her. She\nreported Parent C does have two brothers in the home and both\nare minors. She said the younger brother is Child B, and he has\nsome behavior issues. She has observed both Child B and the\nolder brother in the home, and around Child A. Child B has\nbehaved well around Child A; and no issues have been observed\nor reported for the older brother.\nSupervisor 4, like Administrator 2 and Worker 3 also reported\nCaregiver E was reporting concerns to DHHS and not reaching\nout directly to Eagle Village. Supervisor 4 reported Caregiver E\nwas apparently contacting Osceola DHHS concerning Eagle\nVillage’s management of the case. Caregiver E began contacting\nthe DHHS licensing unit with general management concerns in\nMay 2023. This ramped up with more specific concerns related to\nthe parent and the parental home sometime in July 2023, after\nDHHS set aside permanent custody as an action it would pursue.\nSupervisor 4 reported due to these things happening she began\naccompanying Worker 3 to Caregiver E’s home visits for support.\nShe advised Caregiver E and Caregiver E’s husband when they\nhave concerns they can contact her; and can also go up the chain\nof command if they are not getting their concerns addressed.\nSupervisor 4 reported Caregiver E has her and Worker 3’s email\n7",
    "address and telephone number; but Caregiver E has never\nreached out to her with a specific concern. During Caregiver E’s\nattendance at a meeting with DHHS on this case to address the\ncaregiver’s case management concerns, Caregiver E only asked a\nquestion about the reunification process. That information was\nshared with Caregiver E. Supervisor 4 said that information had\nalso been shared by Worker 3 at Caregiver E’s home visits.\nSupervisor 4 reported when Parent C’s case was initially opened\nthere was concern that Parent C had a space heater and there\nwas no heat in the home. She affirmed what Administrator 2\nreported, that it has been verified during the worker’s home visits\nas recent as a November 2023 home visit that the home has an\nappropriate heat source.\nSupervisor 4 affirmed Worker 3’s reporting that there are two\nbrothers in the parental home. She said no one ever mentioned a\nconcern to her about another child in the home threatening to hurt\nor harm Child A.\nCaregiver E\nI interviewed Caregiver E by telephone on 11/17/2023.\nCaregiver E reported Parent D is her great nephew. She said\nChild A was placed in their unlicensed relative care by DHHS on\n12/6/2022 following Child A’s removal from Parent C’s and Parent\nD’s custody. She advised that for a brief while they had temporary\nguardianship for Child A. She reported since DHHS completed the\nplacement with them, and was at all court hearing, she thought\nDHHS was responsible for Child A’s case. She admitted to\ncontacting DHHS as opposed to Eagle Village with her concerns\nabout Parent C and the parental home. She reported she got\nconfused about who the responsible agency was, so she was\ncontacting DHHS and sending things to them. She reported later\nconfusion as she noted DHHS transferred the case to Eagle\nVillage in January 2023. She said when she started contacting\nWorker 3 three to four months ago she was not getting results,\nand so she was contacting both DHHS and Eagle Village. She did\nnot clarify what specifically she had contacted Worker 3 about\nwhich Worker 3 was not giving her results on. I asked Caregiver E\nwhether she had contacted Supervisor 4 related to concerns or\nabout any lack of contact from Worker 3. Caregiver E admitted\nshe had not. She reported she did subsequently contact\nAdministrator 0. Administrator 0 suggested they have a meeting;\nand a meeting was held with DHHS and Eagle Village. Caregiver\n8",
    "E reported she is now clear that Eagle Village has case\nresponsibility for Child A’s case.\nAs for Worker 3 not making home visits to Parent C’s home,\nCaregiver E reported not knowing how it would be possible that\nWorker 3 would not have completed a visit to Parent C’s home\nprior to Parent C being allowed to have unsupervised visits with\nChild A. She just reported knowing Worker 3 said Worker 3 had\nnot at a court hearing in October 2023. Caregiver E said Child A’s\nunsupervised visits started in October 2023. Notwithstanding\nCaregiver E reporting that Worker 3 said Worker 3 had not made\nhome visits; Caregiver E simultaneously reported Worker 3\nreported at that hearing that the home needed a smoke detector\nand the carbon monoxide detector needed batteries. Caregiver E\ndid not report taking into account Worker 3’s reports of what\ndevices were lacking the home likely came by way of a visit to the\nhome by Worker 3.\nAs to the allegation of the birth mother’s younger brother was\nthreatening to kill Child A, Caregiver E reported knowing this\nallegation to be true. She reported the threat was made by Parent\nC’s six-year-old brother, Child B, who has anger issues. She said\nshe saw a direct message post by either Parent C or Parent D\nmentioning it. She said she told Worker 3 about this matter early\non and Worker 3 said she would take care of it. Later Worker 3\nsaid Child B was getting counseling for his issues. Caregiver E did\nnot elaborate on when these conversations occurred.\nDepartment Worker F and GAL G\nDepartment Worker F and GAL G were interviewed by me by\ntelephone on 11/21/2023 and 12/5/2023 respectively. Neither\nreported having information about any child in the home\nthreatening harm to Child A.\nDepartment Worker F reported Eagle Village has case\nresponsibility; and as such she has not visited the parental home.\nShe did not recall Worker 3’s description of the parental home, but\nquestioned whether the condition of the home was minimized. She\nbased that on her contact with Caregiver E, GAL G and a\n11/14/2023 case contact denoting a concern. Notwithstanding\nthat, at the 10/2023 court hearing, the judge did not indicate a\nconcern with those environmental barriers. The court ordered the\nunsupervised home visits.\nGAL G denied the allegations related to the home. He said he has\nvisited Parent C’s residence, and the home has heat, electricity\n9",
    "and had a full inspection. He reported having no knowledge that\nthe home was not up to code.\nDocument review:\n• Social work contacts of announced and unannounced\nhome visits to Parent C’s home, which showed information\nas reported by Worker 3 related to the home’s condition,\ndiscussions on safety proofing of the home, removing sharp\nitems, having a baby gate and checking so such; checking\non the home’s heat source/noting the heat source as\npropane, checking devices in the home, exploration of a\nmarijuana concern that had been reported, verifying the\nhome still had running water; and the worker’s instruction to\nthe family related to cleaning the home, and the worker\nproviding support. Unannounced and announced home\nvisits were documented for 8/2/2023; 10/18/2023,\n10/16/2023; 11/7/2023, 11/14/2023; and 11/29/2023. Other\nprior visits were documented as 5/11/2023, 3/15/2023,\n2/9/2023; 1/31/2023 and 1/26/203 whereby case reviews,\npermanency planning discussion occurred and advisement\nand encouragement was being indicated.\n• A Safety Plan dated 10/23/2023 that showed Parent C\nagreed to do things to keep Child A safe in the home.\nParent C will utilize appropriate supervision of Child A at all\ntime; will be honest and report barriers and safety concerns\nto the worker; will not allow others to attend the parenting\ntimes unless approved by the worker beforehand; will keep\nthe home safe and clean; will use a baby gate if needed;\nwill put all medicines/chemicals/sharp objects out of reach\nof the child; will keep the floors/areas clean and free of\nsmall/non-safe objects; and practice safe sleep .\n• An email from Caregiver E of screen shots of what\nappeared to be text messages/communications between\nParent D (as well as photos of Child A) and someone (no\nname shown.\n➢ A couple of messages asked if the house was safe,\nclean; and a couple of messages appear to\nmention someone needing help. No names were\nmentioned.\n➢ One text did mention Child B’s name; liking to beat\non little kids; but no mention of Child B or anyone\nthreatening to hurt Child A.\n• A Central Michigan District Health Department (CMDH)\nComplaint Investigation Report related to a complaint\nreceived 10/24/2023 and denoting a 11/14/2023\ninvestigation start date.\n10",
    "➢ The complaint was from an anonymous source.\n➢ It alleged multiple single mobile homes on the\nproperty as well as camper trailers, believed to not\nbe hooked to a well or septic or electric. A trash\npiled six feet high.\n➢ The CMDHD complaint indicated the complaint\nclosed as the structure has functioning sewage\ndisposal and water supply. Owner, Grand Mother H\nreported appointment with the building department\nto verify home compliance. Grand Mother H was\nadvised to clean the debris on the property.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and case documentations, Worker 3 did\nconduct visits to Parent C’s home prior to unsupervised visits and\nthe home was deemed safe for those visits at the time. There is\ninsufficient evidence to support the allegations of a lack of effort to\nfacilitate services and parenting time for reunification.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) placing and supervising children in out- of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1: There are concerns that unsupervised visits are\npermitted with an underage parent using marijuana. Additionally,\nthat the worker admitted in court that she has not received drug\nscreens on the birth mother in two months.\nAllegation 2: The worker allows the birth mom to attend medical\nappointments without an approved visitation supervisor present.\nAllegation 3: There are numerous campers on the property\nwhere Parent C lives with people living in them; and it is unknown\nif background checks were completed before allowing visits at the\nresidence.\nInvestigation Allegation 1:\nInterviews:\nComplainant X\nOn 11/6/2023 I interviewed Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X reported it was reported to her by Caregiver E that\nWorker 3 is aware that Parent C uses marijuana; and Worker 3 is\nbelieved to be okay with that. Caregiver E further alleged that\n11",
    "Worker 3 reported even if Parent C uses marijuana, as long as\nthere is a sober caregiver in the home with Parent C and Child A,\nthen it’s acceptable. Caregiver E expressed to her this is not okay\nbecause Parent C is 16 and Parent C using drugs is not legal.\nAlso, that Parent C was still having “dirty” drug screen drops.\nAdministrator 2\nOn 11/9/2023 I spoke with Administrator 2 about the allegations\nby telephone. She reported the caregiver’s complaints were\naddressed via DHHS. She denied the allegations; and reported\nWorker 3 and Supervisor 4 could best address any details about\nthese allegations.\nWorker 3 & Supervisor 4\nOn 11/13/2023 I interviewed Worker 3 and Supervisor 4\nseparately by video conference via TEAMs. Administrator 1 was\nalso present as a support person during each staff person’s\ninterview.\nWorker 3 denied the allegations. She admitted a concern was\nreported about Parent C and the parental home. She said,\nCaregiver E reported smelling marijuana on 10/26/2023, though\nCaregiver E does not go into the home when she transports Child\nA to the home. Parent C comes to Caregiver E’s car to retrieve\nChild A. Worker 3 reported making a home visit to Parent C’s on\n10/26/2023, around 5:20PM. She did not smell marijuana in the\nhome or on Parent C. She had Parent C complete a drug screen\nthat day, which was the second drug screen for Parent C that\nweek. Both screens were negative. Worker 3 admitted Parent C’s\nsubstance issues were with marijuana. Parent C’s is court ordered\nto complete assessment and treatment for marijuana, with weekly\nrandom drug screens. Worker 3 also admitted she testified in\ncourt about Parent C’s drug screens, but reported the allegations\nas indicated in the complaint were not accurate. She repeated,\nthat Parent C is screened weekly. She said at that court hearing,\nshe did not have Parent C’s September drug screen results and\nthat’s what she reported. She reported she is not okay with Parent\nC smoking Marijuana, nor did she report that to Caregiver E or\nanyone else. She said she knows, as does Parent C, that Parent\nC is not old enough to legally smoke marijuana. That this is why\nthey conduct drug screens. She reported she only referred to\npolicy related to a sober caregiver being in the home.\nSupervisor 4 reported unsupervised visits for Parent C were\nordered by the court not Eagle Village. The court did not ask\n12",
    "whether Eagle Village was supportive of such. Supervisor 4\nacknowledged they had no concerns against it at that time.\nSupervisor 4 affirmed Worker 3’s reporting of the assessment of\nthe parental home; though advised another supervisor not her was\ninvolved in the full assessment of the home. She said she\nattended each court hearing with Worker 3; and Worker 3 never\nreported to the court that Worker 3 never visited Parent C’s home\nnor was it accurate that Worker 3 reported she was accepting of\nParent C using marijuana. Supervisor 4 affirmed Worker 3\nreported policy and it being technically illegal for Parent C to use\nmarijuana. Additionally, she reported there is a safety plan in\nplace related to this. As for the drug screens, Supervisor 4 said\nParent C is screened weekly for drug use. She reported the court\nreport spoke to the drug screens they had, and Worker 3 reported\nin court what test screen results were pending.\nCaregiver E\nI interviewed Caregiver E by telephone on 11/17/2023. Caregiver\nE affirmed the information as reported by the complainant.

    "reported Worker 3 and Supervisor 4 could best address this\nallegation.\nWorker 3 & Supervisor 3\nOn 11/13/2023 I interviewed Worker 3 and Supervisor 3\nseparately by video conference via TEAMs. Administrator 1 was\nalso present as a support person during each staff person’s\ninterview.\nWorker 3 reported these concerns relates to two people; Person\nXX and Person XY, both of whom were cleared by DHHS on\n10/18/2023.

    "Department Worker F reported that Caregiver E reported that a\nperson was moving in or living on the property where Parent C\nlives. That this person is on central registry. Department Worker F\nsaid she contacted Worker 3 with that name. Worker 3 did not\nknow the name and was going to follow up. On 9/8/2023,\nDepartment Worker F reported she ran clearance checks on all\nthe household members on the property due to Worker 3 not be\nable to do all. She said on 10/23/2023 she spoke with Worker 3\nabout the earlier person. Worker 3 reported no to the person\n(believed to be a mentor or neighbor, but no name given) living in\nthe home. Worker 3 reported advising Parent C that Parent C and\nChild A could not be around this person.\nGAL G reported with respect to clearances, Parent C met an adult\nfriend who was going to be a mentor, then that person’s husband\nbecame involved.
