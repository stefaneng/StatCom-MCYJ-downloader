Staff\n1 reported about 10-15 minutes later, Program Manager brought Youth\nA back into the home and was upset with Staff 1 that he did not assist\nwhen Youth A was outside. Staff 1 reported he was confused because\nhe had been told to walk away previously. He stated Program Manager\nthen left the home and Youth A was sitting in a chair near the front\nentryway door.

Youth A remained on the\nground throwing rocks, dirt, and grass at Program Manager for about 20\nminutes. He reported he called the therapist on call and Chief\nAdministrator about the situation. Staff 3 was able to come to talk with\nYouth A and walked her back to the house after about five minutes.\nWhen asked about the restraint policy, Program Manager reported staff\nare only to go hands-on when a youth is in immediate danger of harming\nthemselves or others.

He\nreported he has had no concerns with either of the staff’s performance.\nSupervisor reported Youth A does not fully get along with Staff 1\nbecause he follows through with the rules and does not let her get away\nwith things. He reported prior to this restraint Youth A had no issue with\nStaff 1.\nConference call was held with MDHHS Worker 1 on October 17,\n2023. MDHHS Worker 1 reported there are no findings to the\ninvestigation.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage of September 10, 2023, involving the use of restraint, was\nreviewed on September 20, 2023, in collaboration with Chief\nAdministrator and MDHHS Worker 1. The video begins with Youth A\nsitting in a chair next to Staff 1 in the main milieu area. Youth A is heard\nasking Staff 1 to push in her chair and he encourages her she can do it.\n7",
    "She continues to vocalize that she cannot do it herself and needs him to\ndo it because they are too heavy. Staff 2 is in the kitchen area\nencouraging Youth A that she can push in her chair and Youth A\ncontinues to yell at staff that she cannot. Youth A begins to kick the\ntable and Staff 1 gets up from the table and heads to the living room\narea. Youth A follows Staff 1 into the living room area and begins to\nthrow pillows and tip over chairs. Staff 2 comes into the living room area,\nwalks towards Youth A and continues to follow her as she throws items.\nBoth Staff 1 and Staff 2 are verbally encouraging Youth A to not throw\nthings. None of these items are thrown directly at staff. Youth A\ncontinues to yell at staff and Staff 1 is seen calling Program Manager on\nthe phone due to Youth A's behaviors as overheard on the phone call.\nYouth A then begins to hiss at staff and continues to knock things off all\nthe kitchen counters and Staff 1 and Staff 2 continue to try to verbally\nde-escalate the situation. Within two minutes of the phone call Staff 1\nmade to Program Manager, he arrived at the home. Both Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 tell Program Manager that they do not know what to do with\nYouth A. Program Manager attempts to verbally de-escalate Youth A\nbut then answers a phone call. While on the phone, Program Manager\ncontinues to try to verbally de-escalate Youth A while she is in the\nkitchen asking what is wrong. Youth A just continues to kick things\naround in the kitchen and hiss at staff. Youth A comes out of the kitchen,\nwalks up to Staff 1 and hisses in his face. Staff 1 attempts to walk away\nfrom Youth A and she continues to keep her body right up next to Staff\n1. Youth A pushes her chest onto Staff 1 and he continues to ask to give\nspace. Staff 1 is overheard asking about a restraint and Youth A takes\npushes Staff 1 with her right forearm. Youth A walks away and kicks\nitems on the floor. As Youth A was walking away, she turned back and\nhissed at Staff 1 who was following her. He then grabbed her right arm\nto go into a restraint when Youth A turned to hiss at Staff 2. Staff 2 then\ngrabbed Youth A’s left arm to go into a two-person restraint. During this\ntime Program Manager was on the phone and turned to watch the\nrestraint while on the phone. Youth A struggled with the restraint and it\nlasted about 40 seconds before, Program Manager told Staff 1 and Staff\n2 to release. After that release, Youth A begins to target both Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 and continues to approach them and jab at them. Program\nManager puts the phone down and attempts to help Youth A by telling\nher to stop and following her around the milieu. Staff 1 is overheard\nasking what to do to Program Manager since Youth A continues to push\nhim. Program Manager then walks in between Youth A and Staff 1 and\nengages in a two-person hold with Staff 2. Youth A drops her weight to\nthe floor and the staff disengages. Youth A attempted to pull at Staff 2’s\nsleeve but she was able to get away. Youth A continues to approach\nStaff 1 and Program Manager tells Staff 1 to go take a walk, which he\ndoes. Youth A then turns her attention to Staff 2 and Staff 2 takes a\nphone call and walks out of the home as well. Youth A attempts to follow\nStaff 2 but Program Manager blocks her from going out the door at first\nbut then she exits the home getting out of camera view.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n8",
    "- Facility Restrictive Intervention Administrative Review Form\ndated 09/13/2023- Administrator 1 completed video review of the\nrestraints that occurred on 09/10/2023. Administrator 1 reported\n“he does not see imminent risk of bodily harm to self or others\nprior to the first two restraint taking place. Youth A appeared to\nnot engage with staff while approaching Knapp Street, imminent\nrisk is present for the second two restraint.” The\nrecommendations requested was for Staff 1 and Staff 2 to meet\nwith the restraint training supervisors, conversations with Staff 1\nand Staff 2 completed by supervisors about appropriate use of\npersonal phones and appropriateness of conversation around\nyouth and follow up with Program Manager on delivery of\nfeedback in the moment.\n- MiSACWIS Restraint Reports: 163180206, 163170206,\n162570208, and 162590207- The restraint reports were\nconsistent with the interview completed with Program Manager.\n- Facility Restrictive Intervention Procedures last updated\n08/2022- The procedure form notes, “Restrictive interventions\nare only to be used in emergency situations and as a last resort\nwhen an event/action is likely to result in imminent, serious\nphysical harm and/or loss of life and less restrictive measures\nhave proven ineffective. The use of restraint is not permitted for\nyouth engaging in property damage. Imminent risk of substantial\nharm or loss of life must be imminent to engage in a restrictive\nintervention. When considering the use of restrictive\ninterventions, the following criteria are required: a. Harm to\nSelf- The youth is physically attempting to substantially harm\nthemselves to the point where a staff person cannot safely\nprotect the youth or prevent harm without engaging in a\nrestrictive intervention. Or b. Harm to Others-\nThe youth is physically attempting to substantially harm others to\nthe point where a staff person cannot safely protect youth or\nprevent harm to others without the use of a restrictive\nintervention.”\n- Staff 1 Human Resource File and Training Log- Staff 1 had no\ndisciplinary actions noted within his file prior to this incident. Staff\n1 is up to date on all required trainings and is noted to have the\nAEGIS Initial training dated 08/2/2023.\n- Staff 2 Human Resource File and Training Log- Staff 2 had no\ndisciplinary actions noted within her file prior to this incident. Staff\n2 is up to date on all required trainings and is noted to have the\nAEGIS Initial training dated 04/05/2023 and the Aegis\nBenevolent Holding Skills review training on 04/20/2023.\n- Program Manager Human Resource File and Training Log-\nProgram Manager had no disciplinary actions noted within his file\nprior to this incident. Program Manager is up to date on all\nrequired trainings and is noted to have AEGIS Initial training\n9",
    "dated 11/23/2022 and the Aegis Benevolent Holding Skills\nreview trainings on 03/2/2023, 04/20/2023 and 06/22/2023.\nAnalysis Facility is found in violation of the emergency restraint rule as it pertains\nto the first restraint Staff 1 and Staff 2 completed with Youth A. Per the\nreview of the video, Staff 1 initiated the restraint after Youth A had\npushed him and was walking away from him. At the time Staff 1\nengaged in the restraint there was no immediate danger to Youth A or\nStaff 1.\nTechnical Assistance\nThroughout the course of the investigation, it was found that the lack of\ncommunication within the team working in the home contributed to rule\nviolations found. This is seen within the situation as Staff 1 called\nProgram Manager for support and the Program Manager needed to take\na call for another crisis at the facility so there was no clear\ncommunication about action steps to help support with Youth A’s\nbehaviors. There was a lack of communication of where staff were going\nsuch as Staff 2 left Program Manager with Youth A in an escalated state\nbut never communicated that. There was also lack of communication\nwhen Program Manager brought Youth A back to the home of what next\nsteps were.
