    "ALLEGATION:\nStaff member shoved youth and held youth down. Staff member was terminated\nshortly after for reasons unknown.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 12/03/21 and investigated jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The initial allegations were as follows,\nYouth A (15) is a resident at Methodist Children's Home Society. Staff 1 is a staff\nmember at the residential home. Prior to moving to his current cottage, Staff 1\nshoved Youth A and held him down. Staff 1 was fired shortly thereafter this\nincident for an unknown reason. It is unknown if there is video evidence of this\nincident taking place or not. Youth A was not injured during this incident that is\nknown. It is unknown as to what was taking place prior to Staff 1 assaulting\nYouth A.\nYouth A was interviewed at the facility jointly with the DHHS Specialist on 12/06/21.\nYouth A reported he was hiding from the Supervisor and was redirected. Youth A\nsaid Staff 1 chimed in and was “talking stuff,” and told Youth A that he would have to\nremove items from Youth A’s room if Youth A didn’t come out from hiding. Youth A\nsaid that he “forcibly” went after Staff 1 and pushed Staff 1. Youth A said he did this\nbecause he was going to lose his personal items so “I fight back.” Youth A said Staff\n1 shoved him, picked him up by the legs and slammed Youth A on the ground.\nYouth A said his arm was behind his own back when this happened, and his arm\nwas sore for 2 weeks afterward. Youth A said he didn’t tell anyone about this\nbecause he thought he would heal up fast and it did. Youth A said that a\nmaintenance staff and Staff 2 were around when this occurred, but no kids were\npresent. Youth A said that Staff 1 and Staff 2 (who is reportedly Staff 1’s father)\nrestrained him on the floor with his arms spread out and legs together. Youth A said\nthe Supervisor held his legs and Staffs 1 and 2 held his arms, with Staff 1 putting his\nknee on Youth A’s chest. Youth A said Staff 1 was fired shortly after this incident and\nYouth A moved out of the shelter and into the residential program. Youth A went on\nto report that being at the facility raises his anxiety and he became hyperverbal and\nstarted talking about other, unrelated concerns and wanting to be in another\nplacement, so needed redirection to stay on topic. Youth A said he doesn’t feel safe\ndue to peers threatening to hurt him, but he provided no names. Youth A said he\ngets hurt regularly by peers and that is why is doesn’t feel safe. Youth A reported no\nother concerns with staff at the facility.\nDirector 2 was interviewed at the facility on 12/06/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Director 2 is the Director of Transitional Housing (Shelter). Director 2\nrecalled an escalated incident with Youth A at the shelter but did not recall Staff 1\nhitting Youth A or holding Youth A down. Director 2 said she processed an incident\nwith Youth A and Staff 1, but it was nothing like the allegations. Director 2 said there\n4",
    "had been a couple of incidents in Youth A’s time at the shelter when he hurt staff.\nDirector 2 did not know if Staff 2 had been fired. She confirmed that Staff 2 is a\nmaintenance person and a direct care staff for the residential program but does not\nwork shifts in the shelter. Director 2 confirmed the Supervisor voluntarily left the\nfacility.\nI interviewed Staff 3 at the facility jointly with the DHHS Specialist on 12/08/21. Staff\n3 said that she was working in the shelter and recalled in incident with Youth A being\ndefiant and escalating into aggression with Staff 1. This was the day Youth A was\nhiding and was told to come out and Youth A became verbally aggressive. Staff 3\nsaid that Staff 1 tried to deescalate Youth A, but Youth A went at Staff 1 swinging.\nStaff 1 reportedly backed away and tried to calm Youth A verbally. Staff 3 denied\nseeing Staff 1 push Youth A or slamming Youth A to the floor. Staff 3 denied\nwitnessing Staff 1 restrain Youth A, but Staff 3 said she was not in eyesight of the\nwhole incident as she was watching another youth who was on individual\nsupervision.\nThe DHHS Specialist and I interviewed the Chief Administrator (CA), on 12/08/21, at\nthe facility. The CA reported that to her knowledge, Youth A had assaulted Staff 1.\nThe CA said she was in the administration building when this occurred. The CA said\nthat the Supervisor was in the shelter and had called the police because she wanted\nYouth A hospitalized. The CA said that Director 2 went to the shelter and kept Youth\nA at the facility and the Supervisor was angry with this decision. The CA said that\nDirector 2 texted her for help because the Supervisor was yelling and swearing. The\nCA said that police were already onsite due to a separate event and accompanied\nthe CA to the shelter. The CA said that on their way from the administration building\nto the shelter building, the Supervisor drove past them, left campus, and quit. The\nCA said that when she arrived, there were other administrators there and the report\ngiven to her was that Youth A assaulted Staff 1. The CA went on to report that the\nmonth prior, someone sent a news article to the facility human resources department\nrelated to Staff 1’s criminal history. The CA said that all clearances done by the\nfacility showed Staff 1 as appropriate to work at the facility, however, with the new\ninformation, it was decided that he would be removed from the schedule. Staff 1 has\nsince been let go from employment as of 11/19/21 as they are an at-will agency. The\nCA said that prior to this, Staff 1 was a model staff and very good with the youth.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility, on 12/08/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 2 reported that he is the lead maintenance staff and also works as a direct care\nstaff on a contingent basis in the residential program, but not in the shelter. Staff 1\nsaid that on the day of this incident, he was working as maintenance and was in the\nshelter. Staff 2 said Youth A was attacking Staff 1 and was out of control. Staff 2\nsaid that Youth A and Staff 1 were “already in the throes of it when I came in.” Staff\n2 denied seeing Staff 1 pick-up Youth A and slam him to the floor. Staff 2 said Staff\n1 was protecting himself and put his arms up to hold Youth A in place for a while.\nStaff 2 said he helped Staff 1 hold Youth A. Staff 2 said that at one point they were\nholding Youth A on the ground, and they were also standing at times. Staff 2 said\n5",
    "Staff 1 was “doing the best he could” and noted that Youth A is a lot larger than Staff\n1. During the physical management on the floor, Staff 2 said that he held one of\nYouth A’s arms down while Staff 1 held the other while Youth A was struggling. Staff\n2 said the Supervisor tried to hold Youth A’s legs because Youth A was kicking. Staff\n2 said that Youth A and Staff 1 were “tussling.” The Supervisor left after this incident.\nPer Staff 2, the Supervisor just got in her car and drove off. Staff 2 said he didn’t\nwrite an incident report and noted that as a maintenance staff, they don’t write\nincident reports. Staff 2 said he “never handles situations like this.” The police\narrived as well as other administrative and support staff, but this was after the\nincident. Staff 2 said he was trained in CPI physical management but reported that\nthis was not a CPI restraint. Staff 2 said staff are not allowed to restrain anymore.\nStaff 2 confirmed that Staff 1 is his son.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with the DHHS Specialist on 12/08/21, via phone, as he is\nno longer employed with the facility,. Staff 1 recalled the incident and noted that\nYouth A had returned from school and was not following directions and then hid\nunder the desk. Staff 1 and the Supervisor directed Youth A out from under the\ndesk. The Supervisor then directed Staff 1 to remove Youth A’s personal items from\nYouth A’s room. It was at this time that Youth A charged at Staff 1. Staff 1 said this\nscared the Supervisor, who was new. Staff 1 said that he stepped away, but Youth A\nkept coming at him. Staff 1 said that he and the Supervisor each attempted to\nsecure an arm, but the Supervisor let go. The maintenance staff then helped Staff 1\nsecure Youth A. Staff 1 said Youth A bit Staff 1 before the incident ended.\nReportedly, several supervisors came to help and when the residential supervisor\narrived, Staff 1 left so that Youth A could calm down. Staff 1 said that the Supervisor\ncalled for support during the incident but got no response. Staff 1 said he did not\nwork anymore shifts at the shelter because it took too long for support to arrive. Staff\n1 additionally said that Youth A was spitting at him, so on the third time, Staff 1 put\nhis shirt in Youth A’s mouth. Staff 1 said this was while they were on the floor and\nStaff 2 had directed Staff 1 to do this. Staff 1 said that he didn’t slam Youth A but\nnoted that Youth A jumped on and over the staff desk, and when he jumped down,\nYouth A fell. That is when Staff 1 held Youth A on the floor. Staff 1 said he was\ntrained in CPI but did not use CPI because the Supervisor was scared and\ndisengaged. Staff 1 said that he wasn’t familiar with this youth’s behavior and didn’t\nknow the kid. Staff 1 said only he, Staff 2, and the Supervisor knew about this\nrestraint.\nI interviewed the Supervisor via phone, on 12/21/21, together with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The Supervisor reported Youth A was sent back from school and was\ndirected to do his chores and follow the daily schedule for the cottage. Per the\nSupervisor, when Staff 1 tried to talk to Youth A about being sent back from school,\nYouth A escalated. Youth A was not following directives and Staff 1 removed an item\nfrom Youth A’s room as a consequence. This further escalated Youth A, who tried to\nsnatch the item (thought to be an MP3 player) from Staff 1 and then began hitting\nStaff 1. The Supervisor said Staff 3 was there and she was staffing a youth 1:1, as\nwell as two maintenance staff were present. The Supervisor said she was also\n6",
    "redirecting Youth A. The Supervisor said Staff 1 tried to restrain Youth A from behind\nand Youth A kicked Staff 1 in the privates and Staff 1 let go. Youth A then spit at\nStaff 1 and charged at Staff 1. The Supervisor said Staff 1 then scooped/held Youth\nA against the wall but then they fell to the floor. The Supervisor said she tried to hold\nYouth A to help Staff 1, but Youth A kicked her in the stomach. The Supervisor told\nthe maintenance staff to call for another supervisor. One of the maintenance staff\n(reported to be the maintenance manager) helped Staff 1 hold Youth A down by the\narms and legs. The Supervisor said Youth A was punching and spitting and was\n“buck wild.” The Supervisor called the police because no one came to help them.\nThe police arrived about 30-40 minutes later and Youth A was still on the floor and\nstill struggling, swearing, and kicking. The Supervisor said that she wasn’t going\nback near Youth A since he’d already kicked her. The Supervisor said that there was\nno other way to manage Youth A. Youth A had reportedly also bit Staff 1 and drew\nblood during this incident. The Supervisor said that when the police arrived other\nstaff and supports came and Youth A got up and acted like nothing happened. Per\nthe Supervisor, Director 3 told the police not to take Youth A to the hospital. The\nSupervisor said that she turned in her keys and left the facility, quitting on the spot.\nShe said she didn’t write an incident report and didn’t feel the need because “they\ndon’t do anything to correct the kids.” The Supervisor had been employed there for\ntwo weeks. The Supervisor said that eventually, the residential supervisor came to\nhelp, but that was about 30 minutes into this incident. There was reportedly no\nresponse to the on-call supervisor number.\nDuring email correspondence with Youth A’s foster care worker, some concerns\nwere reported and noted to be in process of being addressed. One of the concerns\nwas that Youth A reported Staff Q called Youth A a “white prick” and threatened to\nkill his former foster parents. The foster care worker said that Youth A escalates\neasily and is easily triggered by other’s incidents. He is working on taking\nresponsibility for his own actions.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Incident Report, dated 09/15/21, authored by Staff 1. The report noted the\nYouth A was not following directions and was put on restriction, so staff were\nremoving some things from Youth A’s bedroom. Youth A charged at Staff 1\nand struck Staff 1 in the face twice. Staff 1 backed up and Youth A continued\nto charge at him. Staff on campus jumped in to help deescalate the situation.\nPolice were called and the director talked with Youth A. Staff 1 documented\nbite marks on his own hand but no child injury.\n Staff 1’s termination letter from the human resources department at the\nfacility, dated 11/19/21.\n Facility policy for Physical Intervention; notes the facility uses the CPI model\nfor physical intervention.\n CPI manual: does not provide for a floor restraint as reported by the staff.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their families,\nand referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as Youth A was restrained by staff and\nheld on the floor, which is not permissible within the facility\nrestraint model, CPI. This floor restraint was reported by Youth\nA, Staff 1, Staff 2, and the Supervisor.

The policy requires staff to document\nthe restraint in the incident report by the end of the shift and to include the\ndetails of the techniques used.\n Facility policy for Reporting and Documenting Critical Incidents, revised\n09/26/21. The policy notes the following:\n8",
    "o ‘… It is critical all staff understand that incident reports must be\naccurate and completed in its entirety because it is a legal document.\nAdditionally, it has an important role with DHHS and its entities,\nincluding the Division of Child Welfare Licensing (DCWL), and Child\nProtective Services (CPS).\no Any staff member can complete an incident report. If multiple staff\nmembers witness and unusual or critical incident, all staff members\nshould complete separate incident reports….\no Staff must complete incident reports that involve:\n• Aggressive behaviors that result in physical management.\nCritical incidents are of the following specific Unusual Incidents: …\naggression or violence, …\no By the end of the shift:\n1.
