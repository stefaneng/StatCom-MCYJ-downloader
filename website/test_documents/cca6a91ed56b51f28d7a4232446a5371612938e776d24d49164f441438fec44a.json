On\n05/26/2023 around 6:30pm, Youth S and other unknown youths\ngained access to cleaning products within the facility. Youth S and\nthe other youths ingested the cleaning products, which was a\npremeditated plan. Youth S was found lying on the ground having\ndifficulty breathing after she ingested the products. Youth S was\ntransported to Garden City Hospital, where she was evaluated for\nher physical and mental health. It was recommended that Youth S\nbe admitted to an inpatient psychiatric care, but they were not able\nto find a bed for her. Youth S was released from the hospital and\nsent back to Vista Maria on 05/31/2023. Youth S is on observation\nat the facility, but there is a high concern for her mental health. It is\nnot believed that Youth S was released with any additional mental\nhealth resources, and there is also concern how she was able to\naccess the cleaning products. Youth S is already high risk for\nsuicidal ideations and self-harm.\n2",
    "I interviewed Youth S face to face at the facility in collaboration\nwith the Government Worker on 6/2/23. Youth S is in the 9th\ngrade and is 15 years old. Youth S reported she was feeling\ndown and upset after a visit with her worker who reported to her\nthat they could not locate a foster home for her due to behaviors\nand that she would be at Vista until she was 19 years old. Youth\nS reported she has been at Vista for 2 years and feels stuck.\nYouth S reported she took a bottle of cleaning solution from the\nhallway closet and took it to her room and drank ½ the bottle as\nshe wanted to kill herself. Youth S reported Youth M saw her\ningest the solution and took the bottle from her and got staff.\nYouth S report that Youth Worker D came to her room and Nurse\nH came and checked on her before she was transported by\nambulance to Garden City Hospital. Youth S reported she took the\ncleaning solution from the hallway cleaning supply closet that is\nsupposed to be locked at all times. The closet was not locked so\nshe was able to grab the bottle and take it to her room. Youth S\nwas at the hospital for four days with Vista staffing there. Youth S\nreported they she was unable to shower due to the hospital not\nhaving enough staffing.\nAfter four days at the hospital Youth S reported she lied about no\nlonger feeling suicidal and was ready to come back to the facility\nas she had a plan to AWOL. Youth S reported that Supervisor F\nand Youth Worker C transported her back to the facility. Youth\nWorker S reported she got out of the car on Vista property and\nattempted to run and Youth Worker C grabbed her around the\nwaist and stopped her and then Supervisor F and Youth Worker C\ntransported her into the building. Youth S reported she was very\nupset and was crying, wheezing and felt like nobody was\nsupporting her. She reported requesting water and her inhaler\nand that nobody gave it to her. Youth S reported she started\nthrowing books, punching at staff, and that Supervisor F called her\na “slow ass kid” and told her she “stank”. Youth S reported\nhaving several bruises from the incident the evening she returned.\nYouth S reported Supervisor F slammed her head against the\nwall. Youth S reported she was given water and she drank it and\nthen spit in the cup and threw it on Supervisor F. Youth S reported\nshe took the sanitizer gel off the wall and drank some of it and\nattempted to suck the liquid out of alcohol wipes that evening.\nYouth S reported she coughed really bad from doing this. Youth S\nreported she got a metal spring off the ground and placed it in her\nbra and Supervisor F said she had a weapon, and he would\nrestrain her to get it. Youth S reported she was restrained by\nSupervisor F and Supervisor O and a female staff removed the\n3",
    "metal item from her shirt. Youth S reported she pulled the strip off\nthe side of the table and wrapped it around her neck, and she took\na piece of metal and tried cutting her wrist with it. Both items were\ntaken from her by staff.\nI interviewed Youth M at the facility on 6/2/23 face to face with the\nGovernment Worker. Youth M reported she is 17 years old. She\nreported she saw Youth S grab the solution and take it to her\nroom. Youth M reported she went into the room and saw Youth S\ndown the bottle of solution and drop the bottle. Youth M reported\nshe picked up the bottle and put the top back on and put it back in\nthe closet and got staff for help. Youth M reported Youth S was\nlying on the floor choking and the nurse forced Youth S to sit up\nwhen she arrived. Youth M reported she brought Youth S water,\nand they waited one and half hours for an ambulance. Youth M\nreported the staff working were Supervisor F, Youth Worker D and\nYouth Worker C. Youth M reported that Supervisor F slammed\nYouth S’ head into the wall when she returned from the hospital.\nYouth M denied seeing it but reported she heard it.\nYouth M reported Youth D drank widow spray a few days after\nYouth S and was taken to the hospital. Youth D got the window\nspray from the towel closet that was not locked but should have\nbeen locked as unopened cleaning products are also kept in that\ncloset. Youth D was taken to Garden City Hospital after drinking\nthe window cleaner solution.\nI interviewed Youth Worker D on 6/2/23 face to face at the facility\nwith the Government Worker. She reported she has been\nemployed at Vista for the past two months working the afternoon\nshift. Youth Worker D reported that she had the three girls from\nher wing (Youth S, Youth M and Youth D) at the park on campus\nand all seemed fine with them. A campus clear was called when\nthey were at the park, so they had to return to the wing. Youth are\nrequired to be in their rooms during a campus clear and if youth\nare in their room, you do not have to be in line of sight of them at\nall times. Youth Worker D reported she was at the desk and\nSupervisor F was in his office and they heard gasping breathing\nand Youth M saying “I told you not to do it “ over and over. Youth\nWorker D reported she went down the hall and Youth S was sitting\non the floor just outside her bedroom and then was laying on the\nfloor coughing and gasping for air. Youth Worker D reported she\nbelieves Youth S drank TB, a disinfectant solution. She reported\nSupervisor F had to ask Youth M a few times what Youth S drank\nand to get him the bottle and then he called poison control and the\ncampus nurse and someone else called an ambulance.

Youth Worker C reported that Nurse H came and\nasked what poison control said and then EMS came and got\nYouth S. Youth Worker C denied writing an incident report.\nYouth Worker C reported she went with Supervisor F to pick up\nYouth S from the hospital about 7:30pm and Youth S seemed fine\nand was apologetic to them about the situation.

Youth Worker C\nreported they were standing for the restraint, and it lasted about 1\nminutes. Youth Worker C reported the restraint was done against\nthe wall as they were standing by the wall. Youth Worker C denied\n5",

Youth Worker C reported Youth S was given\nwater and she drank it, and the cup was refilled for her, and she\nspit in it and threw the cup with water and spit on Supervisor F.\nShe reported additional staff were called to the unit during this\nincident to assist. Youth S’ therapist and staff psychologist were\nalso called. Youth Worker C reported that Supervisor F was\nunable to remove himself from the incident or wing as a male\ncouldn’t go work in another wing in the building alone with female\nyouth.\nI interviewed Team Leader JJ who reported working afternoons\nTuesday-Saturday.

He reported he has been a team\nleader for the past 5 years. He reported he came to DeRoy\nresponding to assistance being needed. When he arrived, he\nreported Youth S had a pen and wouldn’t give it up and Youth S\nwas cussing at everyone, was refusing to do many things asked of\nher and had pulled the fire alarm. Team Leader O reported Youth\nS attempted to self-harm by placing something around her neck\nand she placed something inside her shirt that she had attempted\nto self-harm with. He reported staff took away the item she put\naround her neck and he and Supervisor F restrained Youth S\nwhile a female staff removed the item in her shirt.

Nurse H reported on 5/26/23 she was in the\nmidst of several crises in more than one building. She was called\nto DeRoy and was driven there, and she ran inside and found\nYouth S lying on the floor by her room in the hallway breathing\nfast and saying, “I can’t, I can’t” and was crying. Nurse H reported\nshe asked Youth S can you breathe, are you having any pain and\nwhat hurts. Nurse H reported she could tell she was getting\noxygen and was breathing hard. Nurse H reported she sat on the\nfloor with Youth S until the ambulance came (approximately 10\nminutes). Nurse H reported she was informed that the hospital\nwas admitting her, and she was not working the day Youth S\nreturned.\nI interviewed Nurse T face to face at the facility on 6/7/23 with the\nGovernment Worker. Nurse T was not there when Youth S\ningested the solution but was called the evening she returned from\nthe hospital. She reported she was called when Youth S was\ndestroying property and was hyperventilating. Nurse T indicated\nshe heard that Youth S picked up sanitizer but did not ingest it and\nshe was told that Youth S had superficial cuts from self-harming.\nShe was not told about the item she put around her neck.

Nurse T reported she instructed the staff to\n7",
    "give Youth S her inhaler and to call her back in 10 minutes if\nYouth S got worse or not better.

The\npsychiatric and clinical director overruled her recommendation and\nplaced her on 100% supervision. The Therapist reported it was\nher understanding that Youth S’ recommendation was for in\npatient when she was at the hospital, and she was in the ER for\nfour days and her packet for inpatient was sent out but there were\nno beds. The therapist reported she recently did a screen on\nYouth S, and she was negative for suicide, and she was taken off\n100% and she is slowly stepping down to less supervision.\nI interviewed Supervisor F on 6/7/23 face to face at the facility with\nthe Government Worker. He reported on 5/26/23 right after\narriving Youth M reported Youth S had drank cleaning solution. He\nreported Youth S was on the floor holding her throat saying it was\nburning.

Youth S\nattempted to run when she was let out of the car and Supervisor F\nsaid he grabbed Youth S’ arm and Youth Worker C grabbed an\narm and her waist to stop her from running. Supervisor F reported\nthey cannot restrain a youth from AWOL but when they are\nthreatening suicide they can intervene. He reported they were\nafraid as Youth S had reported she was going to run in front of a\ncar. Supervisor F reported they restrained Youth S outside twice\n8",
    "during the escort inside for her to calm. Once they got inside, they\nlet Youth S go. He reported Youth S started kicking, fighting,\npunching, pacing, swearing and tearing up stuff.

Youth S was reportedly\nthrowing chairs, flipping over computer desks, and tables.\nSupervisor F reported Youth M was standing in front of Youth S\nsaying to staff “don’t touch her“ during most of the evening.\nWhen the campus clear was called additional staff came to DeRoy\nto assist. Youth Worker P and Team Leader O came to the unit.\nSupervisor F reported Youth S continued to be aggressive and\npulled down the shade pole from the wall and he immediately took\nit from her. He reported Youth S then found metal pieces on the\nground from the shade being ripped out and attempted to self-\nharm her wrist with it. He reported Youth S placed a piece down\nher shirt, and she had to be restrained to have it removed from her\nshirt by a female staff. Supervisor F reported Youth S continued to\nbe destructive and started hyperventilating so Supervisor F called\nthe nurse and was instructed to give Youth S her inhaler which\nthey did. He reported Youth S took 4 puffs of her inhaler after\nbeing instructed to take 2 and she was given water. He reported\nNurse T suggest having her take her medication, but Youth S\nrefused.\nSupervisor F reported Youth S was being provided a lot of\nredirections but continued to be destructive and then threw her\ncup of water with spit in it on him. Supervisor F denied that Youth\nS drank sanitizer, that he called her any names or said she\nsmelled bad or was a slow ass kid. Supervisor F indicated he\ncould not swap out with another staff due to being staffed with\nonly women that evening and Team Leader O had already left.\nSupervisor F reported that he never hit Youth S head or face\nagainst the wall.\nI interviewed Supervisor B on 6/7/23 face to face at the facility with\nthe Government Worker.

She reported she was told by Supervisor F\nwhen Youth S drank the cleaning solution, and she called the\nnurse and EMS and then went outside to direct the ambulance.\nSupervisor B was not working the night Youth S returned.\n9",
    "I interviewed Youth Worker CD face to face at the facility on\n6/7/23 with the Government Worker. She reported she came over\nto DeRoy from Freedom when the campus clear was called. She\nreported when she arrived at DeRoy Youth S was sitting on a\ntable and was very upset and told Youth Worker CD she didn’t\nwant to be here. Youth Worker CD reported they talked about\nways to handle anger and she was able to talk Youth S into taking\nher medication and a shower. Youth Worker CD reported she\nnever heard anyone say Youth S smelled but she could smell her.\nYouth Worker CD never saw Youth S restrained, and she did not\nsee any marks or bruises on Youth S. She did not hear Youth S\nsay she wanted to hurt herself and she was not there when the\nfire alarms were pulled/ringing.\nI interviewed Youth Worker P on 6/7/23 face to face at the facility\nwith the Government Worker. She has been employed at Vista for\ntwo years. She came over to DeRoy from Freedom where she\ntypically works for the campus clear that was called. She reported\nYouth S had torn up paper and thrown items and she helped clean\nup the mess.\nI interviewed Youth D on 6/21/23 face to face at the facility with\nthe Government Worker. Youth D is 14 years old and is going into\nthe 9th grade. Youth D and Youth S reside on the same wing in\nDeRoy. Youth D reported that she drank a cleaning solution from\nthe towel closet two days after Youth S as she wanted to kill\nherself. She reported there are two closets on the wing, the\nchemical closet and the towel closed. The chemical closet is\nwhere Youth S got the cleaning solution to drink, and Youth D got\nthe cleaning solution from the towel closet where extra unopened\ncleaning fluid is kept. Both closets are supposed to be kept\nlocked at all times. Youth D denied that anyone told her to ingest\ncleaning solution and that she did not have a pact with other youth\nto drink cleaning solution. Youth D reported drinking cleaning\nsolution is one of the only ways to try and kill yourself at Vista\nbesides self-harm. Youth D reported she wanted to die and\nwanted to “cease to exist” during the interview. The Government\nWorker indicated to Vista staff that Youth D needed to be taken to\nChildren’s Hospital for suicidal ideation following the interview.\nYouth D is currently in the hospital at Kingswood for suicidal\nideation.\nI interviewed Consumer Rights Officer on 6/21/23 who reviewed\nvideo and reported that no one checked the closet on 5/26/23\nfrom midnight forward leaving it open the day when Youth S got\naccess to cleaning solution and drank it. On 5/28/23 the linen\n10",
    "closet was left open during/after chores were completed. He\nreported the cleaning solutions Vista uses are nontoxic and can\nmake one feel sick but are not lethal if ingested.\nVideo:\n5/26/23 6:04pm Youth S goes to the supply closed and opens the\ndoor and grabs a bottle of cleaner and takes it to her room.\n6:06pm Youth M goes down the hall to Youth S’ room and then\ncomes out with a bottle of cleaning solution and puts it away in the\ncloset and then goes down hallway. Youth S can be seen at the\nend of the hallway in front of her bedroom door coughing and\ngrabbing at her throat. She is laying on the floor flopping around.\nSupervisor F and Youth Worker D come into the video and\nSupervisor F is getting the bottle of solution and Youth M is\nassisting him with knowing which bottle. Youth Worker D is\ntending to Youth S who continues to be on the floor.\nVideo 5/28/23 DeRoy wing 6:36pm. Supervisor F is observed\nopening the cleaning supply closet and the towel closet and\npropping them open and pouring cleaning solution into a mop\nbucket. 7pm Youth D gets towels from the closet. 7:02 pm Youth\nD picks up a bottle of cleaner in the towel closet and reads it and\nputs it back down. 7:05 Youth D is standing in front of the two\nopen closets and staff comes and closes and locks the cleaning\nsupply closet. Youth D is seen trying to open the door to the\ncleaning closet after the staff member leaves. 7:06pm Youth D\ngoes and stands by the towel closet and is pacing and then goes\ninto the towel closet and takes a bottle of cleaner and goes down\nthe hall and into a room with it. She then comes out and sweeps\nthe hallway. 7:28pm she goes to her room. 7:31pm Youth M\ngoes to Youth D’s room and then comes out and heads down the\nhallway. 7:33pm staff come and get the cleaning fluid bottle and\nput it away and lock the closet. Youth D is seen at the far end of\nthe hallway on the floor.\nDocumentation Review:\nIncident report dated 5/26/23 authored by Youth Worker D -\nreport consistent with all staff reports when Youth S ingested the\ncleaning solution.\nIncident report dated 5/28/23 no author is identified on the report.\nReport indicated Youth D drank cleaning fluid she obtained from\nthe towel closet at 7:35pm.
