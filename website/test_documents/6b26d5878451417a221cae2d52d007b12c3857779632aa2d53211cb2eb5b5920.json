There are 8 records that have\nnot been submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed the Program Director of foster care and adoption. He reported there\nwere eight files that were not sent to the local offices. He reported\ntwo adoption files were submitted to Macomb County DHHS on 6/2/2022. One\nadoption file was sent to Oakland County DHHS office on 6/2/2022, two adoptions\nfiles were sent to North Central DHHS office on 6/2/2022 and three adoption files\n2",
    "were sent to Western Wayne DHHS on 6/10/2022.\nThe Program Director reported these adoption files were not submitted timely\nbecause he was uninformed of the actual process of submitting the files and that he\ntakes full responsibility for not knowing who to contact. He said he was unaware of\nwhich offices were operational during the time the files were due because of the\npandemic. He said some offices were only open on certain days and some were\nclosed. He also reported that now the agency knows the process and moving\nforward files will be delivered on time.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12713 Adoption placement record.\n(5) The Michigan department of human services must\npermanently retain all adoption records for children\nadopted from Michigan's child welfare system. The\nadoption agency must forward any adoption records for\nchildren adopted from the Michigan child welfare system to\nthe department one year after finalization of the adoption.\nThe adoption agency may not retain the original copies or\nany other copies of the adoption records.\nANALYSIS:\nThe Facility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent\nretention one year following the final order of adoption as\nrequired. There were 8 records that have not been submitted\ntimely to the local DHHS offices. Therefore, this agency is in\nviolation with the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",

RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, I recommend that the license\nremains unchanged.\n08/5/2022\n________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 5, 2022\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
