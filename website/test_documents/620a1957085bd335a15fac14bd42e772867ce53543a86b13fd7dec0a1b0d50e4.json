In addition, the agency noted that staff turnover and retention\nimpacted overall compliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment reported the agency’s difficulty in meeting some\nof the requirements due to COVID 19. Specifically, the assessment mentioned\ncontract amendment requirements that were not accurately reflected in Book of\n9",
    "Business and MMR data, such as video conferencing. In addition, the agency\nexperienced staff turnover and difficulty hiring new staff due to a limited number of\nqualified applicants. It was noted that staff turnover had been reduced from the\nprevious year.\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment indicated the agency adopted Clinical Case\nReviews in response to the previous year’s audit. The agency began utilizing LEAN\nmethods toward the end of 2021 to retain staff and address compliance with policy,\nISEP and audit compliance. The agency has also implemented mandatory protected\ntime as well as training centered around planning and organization. The CA\nexpressed confidence that these changes will positively impact several areas of\ncompliance over the next review period.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted with six staff via telephone. Staff acknowledged some\nchallenges during the last review period regarding COVID 19 as well as difficult\nclients and the loss of face-to-face contact due to working remote. However, the staff\nreported those challenges were outside of agency control and felt the agency\nadapted well. Staff reported feeling supported by supervision and noted supervisors\nand co-workers are available to assist as needed. Staff also expressed the agency\nhas effective systems in place to ensure compliance.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy.
