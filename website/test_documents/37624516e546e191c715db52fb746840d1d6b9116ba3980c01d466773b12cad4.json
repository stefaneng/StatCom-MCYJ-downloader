Thorough background\nchecks were not completed, and the adult remained in the home providing care to\nand supervising the children.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe complaint was received via the DCWL online complaint portal on 04/07/2021,\nand I interviewed the complainant on the same day. The complainant verified the\ninformation in the online complaint. It was reported that a complaint was assigned to\na DHHS Specialist for investigation on 03/25/21 and the investigation was being\ncompleted jointly with the agency Licensing Worker and Licensing Supervisor.\nDuring the DHHS Specialist’s interview with the foster parent a review of household\nmembers occurred. The foster parent said that her adult brother was residing in the\nhome and the brother’s contact information was provided to the DHHS Specialist. It\nwas reported that the brother was called, his date of birth was verified, and a\ncriminal history was completed by the DHHS Specialist on 03/30/2021. The\ncomplainant said that it was found that the adult household member (brother) had a\ncriminal history consisting of multiple felony offenses including violent offenses. On\n03/30/21, upon learning of the household member's criminal history, the DHHS\nSpecialist called the Licensing Worker to inquire if this was brought to their attention.\nReportedly, the Licensing Worker confirmed that the Licensing Supervisor was\naware of the household member's felony criminal history and that he was released\nfrom prison 3 years ago. The complainant said the Licensing Worker referred all\nfurther questions to her supervisor.\nIt was then reported, on 03/31/21, that the Licensing Supervisor said she was\nnotified by the foster parent, on 02/18/2021, that the brother was going to be moving\ninto the home. The Licensing Supervisor reportedly stated that she ran a clearance\non the brother, and it yielded the felony convictions, but after a conversation with the\n4",
    "brother he stated that the convictions were for a different individual with the same\nname as him. The complainant advised that she contacted the adult brother on\n03/31/21, and the brother acknowledged that he had felony criminal history and\nstated that he was \"cleared by the Licensing Supervisor\". The complainant also\nreported being informed by foster care that the adult household member was\nproviding care, without the foster parent, for the MCI ward on 03/31/2021.\nThere was an emergency conference call for this case on 04/01/2021 with various\nparties related to this case. The complainant said that during the call, the Licensing\nSupervisor continued to question if the felony convictions were of this man or of\nanother individual with the same name. The Licensing Supervisor was then informed\nthat the DHHS Specialist looked up the offender profile on Michigan Department of\nCorrections and the adult's photograph is on his profile, and that the DHHS\nSpecialist confirmed the history with the adult brother directly. The complainant\nadded that the agency said the agency never added this adult as a household\nmember to the foster home record and it is believed that the adult was residing in the\nhome/providing direct care to the foster children for at least/approximately 30 days.\nThe complainant further reported that on 04/01/2021, the foster parent was asked if\nthe licensing agency was made aware of her brother's criminal history and the foster\nparent reported that the Licensing Supervisor was fully aware of the multiple felony\nconvictions. The complainant also reported that the Licensing Supervisor was aware\nthat the adult brother was sleeping in the same room as foster children and did not\ncorrect the situation.\nI discussed the complaint with the Chief Administrator via phone on 04/14/21. The\nChief Administrator was aware of this situation but referred me to the Licensing\nSupervisor and Licensing Worker.\nI interviewed the Licensing Supervisor (LS) on 04/16/21 via video meeting. The LS\nreported that she is assigned this foster home and the Chief Administrator is her\nsupervisor. The Licensing Worker is assigned to the complaint on this foster home.\nThe LS said that she learned from the foster parent on 02/28/21 that the foster\nparent had a very difficult incident with one of the children placed in her home\nresulting in the police being called to the home and the youth taken for psychiatric\nevaluation. The LS said that she then received a text message from the foster parent\nthat her brother was going to come and help her. The LS said that she was not told\nthat the brother was going to be staying in the home, but just helping. The LS said\nthat she asked for the adult brother’s information and submitted a Central Registry\nclearance on 02/28/21 since the foster parent said he was going to help her with the\nchildren. The LS said that she did not find out the brother was in the home at all until\n03/03/21, when she reviewed the police report related to the difficult incident with the\nfoster child. The LS also stated that, on 03/04/21, the foster parent sent her a copy\nof a safety plan she created herself that noted the adult brother and adult nephew\nwould be sleeping in the room with one of the foster children for safety reasons.\nWhen asked who the nephew belonged to, the LS did not know and acknowledged\nthat she had not asked the foster parent about this. The LS said she ran criminal\n5",
    "clearances on the adult brother on 03/05/21 and noted a criminal history but\nconflicting information with his middle initial and birthdate. The LS said she double\nchecked the middle initial with the foster parent, who said the brother did not have a\nmiddle name. The LS also said that the date of birth was different than the\nidentification provided by the brother. The LS said she met with the adult brother on\nor about 03/05/21 and he denied that the criminal charges on the background check\nwere his. He also denied having a middle initial. The LS said that she and the\nLicensing Worker advised the adult brother and the foster parent that this was an\nissue and that he needed to get the clearances resolved if this was not him. Per the\nLS, the adult brother and foster parent were told that he could not provide care to the\nfoster children. The LS said that the different birth date and middle initial from the\nadult brother’s identification made her unsure if the history was actually his. On or\nabout 03/13/21-03/15/21, the LS said that the DHHS Specialist advised her that the\nDHHS Specialist ran clearances and confirmed that the criminal history was for the\nadult brother and directed her how to view additional information in the public\ndatabase where there was a photo of the brother. During this period of time, the LS\nsaid that she did not know the brother was living in the home, but thought he just\ncame into the area to help, as reported by the foster parent. The LS said that she\ntold the foster parent again on, or about, 03/30/21, that the brother could not provide\ncare during a telephone call. It was not until the foster care workers and DHHS\nSpecialist advised that he was providing care unsupervised by the foster parent that\nshe learned of this.\nThe LS provided some additional clarification on this via email on 04/19/21. The\nfollowing was reported:\nThe foster parent notified me indicating that she was having a great deal of\ndifficulty with the children placed in her home on 2/18/2021. She indicated that\nshe spoke to her brother, and he may be able to provide some help to her. I\nindicated that she would need to provide his driver’s license and social security\ncard so that a central registry check and police check could be completed.\nIndicated that he could not provide care to children until he is cleared.\nThe agency was made aware that the adult brother was living in the home\nthrough an email that was sent at 7:19 pm on 3/4/21. Did not open email until\n3/5/21. This outlined a safety plan that the foster parent developed and sent to\nthe foster care worker as well as me. This was not a safety plan that I assisted\nthe foster parent in writing.\nAfter the agency was made aware that arrangements had been made for the\nadult brother to sleep in the same room as a foster child, the foster parent was\ncontacted to indicate that her brother was not cleared yet.\nThis email went on and the LS reiterated in the email that there was uncertainty\nrelated to the brother’s date of birth and middle initial. The LS also reiterated that\nshe told the foster parent that the brother could not provide care to the child. The LS\nnoted on 03/12/21 she had a meeting at the home with the foster parent, adult\n6",
    "brother, and Licensing Worker, where she reviewed the criminal history and the\nadult brother stated that was not him. She advised the brother how to clear his\nrecord and that it needed to be remedied before he could provide care. The LS also\nemailed, “The foster parent had indicated on a couple of occasions that her adult\nbrother was not staying in the home all the time.” The email further stated that the\nLS and LW were at the home on 03/26/21, along with the DHHS Specialist, when\nthe foster parent said that her adult brother would be moving out of the home and\nshould be gone by 03/28/21. The LS wrote that she told the foster parent that he\ncould not provide care and needed to be out of the home. The LS said that the foster\nparent advised on 03/31/21 that he was no longer in the home.\nI interviewed the Licensing Worker (LW) via video conference on 04/20/21. The LW\nreported that she has received several complaints on this foster home recently.\nRegarding the foster parent’s adult brother residing in the home, the LW said that\nshe became aware of it from the LS after the police report (from an incident in the\nhome) was reviewed. The LW said this is not her assigned home, so she was not\nsure when the adult brother moved in. The LW said that during her visit to the home\non 03/26/21 she did not notice belongings of the adult brother’s in the home, but the\nfoster parent said that he was storing some things in the garage and they were to be\ngone by 03/28/21. The LW said that she was aware that the clearance on the adult\nbrother yielded criminal convictions but noted there was a discrepancy in the middle\nname and date of birth. The LW said that she and the LS asked the foster parent\nand brother about this and they both said that the brother did not have a middle\nname and the convictions were not his. The LW said that they directed the foster\nparent and brother to clear this up before providing care to the children or being\nalone with the children. The LW said that it was not until later on, 03/31/21, that they\nwere advised the adult brother was watching the kids when the foster parent called\nthe LS while running an errand and told the LS that the adult brother was watching\nthe kids.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows, with applicable\ninformation noted:\n MiSACWIS review of the foster home information\no Household members did not include the adult brother, nephew, or son\n Safety plan email from foster parent sent to LS: dated 03/04/21 and noted\nthat her adult son, adult brother, and adult nephew were in the home with her\ndue to the difficulties with one foster child’s behaviors. This plan noted that\nthe adult brother and adult nephew would be sleeping in the room with one of\nthe foster children for safety due to the child’s behaviors, while she slept\nupstairs. It further noted that the foster parent would “one on one” with one\nfoster child, while “the men will each one on one with” the other foster child.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12309 Records check.\n(1) An agency shall, upon receipt of an application, request\nthe department of state police to conduct both a criminal\nhistory check and a criminal record check through the\nfederal bureau of investigation for applicants. The agency\nshall also request the department to conduct a criminal\nhistory check on all persons residing in the home over 18\nyears of age. Additional checks shall pertain to previous\nlicenses, and substantiated child abuse and neglect\nrecords for all applicants and persons residing in the home\n18 years of age or over in Michigan and in all states where\nthe applicant has resided in the 5 years preceding the\napplication.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation as the Licensing Supervisor became\naware of the adult brother staying/sleeping in the home when\nthe foster parent sent the Licensing Supervisor the safety plan,\non or about 03/04/21. The licensing Supervisor did not take\naction on the home to correct this situation. Although the\nLicensing Supervisor said she told the foster parent that the\nadult brother could not provide care, she did not direct him to\nleave the home until 03/26/21, or coordinate with the borrowed\nbed foster care workers for the children in the home related to\ntheir safety. Additionally, on 03/04/21, the foster parent advised\nin the safety plan that her adult son and an adult nephew were\nalso staying in the home to help her. When asked about this, the\nLicensing Supervisor said she was not sure who the nephew\nwas or how he was related. No clearances were provided as\ndocumentation for these individuals who the Licensing\nSupervisor was advised were staying in the home.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nAgency allowed an adult household member to sleep in the same room with the\nfoster children and provide care and supervision.\nINVESTIGATION:\nSee investigation notes above.\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12319 Substitute care policy.\nAn agency's substitute care policy shall, at a minimum,\ncontain provisions for all of the following:\n(a) Qualifications for substitute caregivers, consistent\nwith the requirements of 1973 PA 116 and child care\nlicensing rules.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation as the foster parent was advised on\n03/04/21, via the safety plan, that her adult son, adult brother,\nand adult nephew were staying in the home to help her with the\nchildren due to the intense behavior issues. The plan further\nnoted that the brother and nephew were sharing a sleeping\narea, to provide care and supervision to one of the foster\nchildren at night due to the child’s behaviors. Although the\nLicensing Supervisor reported that she told the foster parent the\nadult brother could not provide care due to his clearance, she\ndid not report addressing this situation in any other manner.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nStaff also compromised a DHHS investigation in this same home. Concerns that\nagency is not appropriately addressing issues through special evaluations of this\nprovider.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe complainant reported that a DHHS Specialist was assigned an investigation of\nthis foster parent on 03/25/21, and it was being completed jointly with the Licensing\nWorker. The complainant noted that the Licensing Supervisor was also very involved\nin this investigation. The complainant reported that the agency notified the foster\nparent of the allegations prior to the DHHS worker being able to interview the foster\nparent and expressed concern that the alleged perpetrator would coach the alleged\nvictim. It was alleged that the Licensing Worker initially said that the Licensing\nSupervisor had shared the allegations. The DHHS Specialist reportedly met with the\nLicensing Worker and Licensing Supervisor at the foster home on 03/26/2021, and\nasked what exactly they told the alleged perpetrator. The Licensing Supervisor\nreported that all they told the foster mother was that a DHHS complaint was received\nand that someone would be following up with her. The complainant said that the\nDHHS Specialist directly told the Licensing Supervisor that the foster care worker\nsaid the allegations were already shared with the foster parent. The complainant\n9",
    "said that the Licensing Supervisor’s explanation was that the foster mother has a\nright to know the allegations. The complainant acknowledged that the alleged\nperpetrator has a right to know the allegations but said that the investigative process\nshould be coordinated with all involved. The complainant also alleged that the\nLicensing Supervisor and Licensing Worker questioned the foster child after the joint\ninterviews were done and the DHHS Specialist had left the home. The complainant\nsaid that during this additional questioning, the child recanted their report, but said it\nin a manner that showed the child was coached. The complainant reported that at\nthe end of the joint interview of the child, the child disclosed that the foster parent\ntold him not to talk about the allegations. The child then disclosed that what was\nalleged actually did happen.\nDuring the LS interview on 04/14/21, the LS reported that she did tell the foster\nparent about the complaint. The LS said that the licensing rules require notification\nof the allegations within five days. The LS said that she had already talked to the\nfoster parent before she got notification of the DHHS Specialist being assigned and\nhad told her the allegations and that she would probably hear from DHHS. The LS\nalso said that she was not aware that they were not supposed to make the foster\nparent notification, which is outlined in the Technical Assistance manual. The LS\nreiterated this in a 04/19/21 email when she wrote, “The LW and I did not realize that\nthe foster parent should not have been advised until after the DHHS specialist had\nindicated that information to us.” The LS said that she was at the home during the\ninterviews and did not question the youth after the DHHS Specialist left. The LS said\nthat the foster parent approached her and the LW and told the child to tell them why\nhe lied. The child then said he lied about what happened to get off punishment. The\nLS said they did not continue to question the child.\nI interviewed the Licensing Worker (LW) via video conference on 04/20/21. The LW\nreported that she received an email related to a complaint on this foster home on\n03/24/21 and about 20 minutes later received notification that DHHS was going to\ninvestigate as well. The LW said that during a call from the foster parent on\n03/25/21, where she and the LS were both on the call, the LS notified the foster\nparent of the special investigation and the allegations. The LW said that the DHHS\nSpecialist called later on 03/25/21 and scheduled an unannounced home visit to\ninvestigate the complaint on 03/26/21. The LW said that the DHHS Specialist\naddressed the LW and LS on telling the foster parent about the allegations prior to\nthe interviews and advised them that on joint investigations they should wait until\nthey do the initial contact to notify in person, to try and prevent the children from\nbeing coached or threatened. The LW, LS and DHHS Specialist went in the home\nand conducted interviews. The LW said the LS stayed with the foster parent while\nthe children were being interviewed to ensure privacy. The LW said that during the\nfoster child’s interview, he said that the foster parent told him to tell the workers that\nhe was lying to get out of punishment. After the interviews, the LW said the DHHS\nSpecialist left. When the LW went back in the house, the foster parent directed the\nfoster child to tell them (the LW and the LS) why he was lying. The child said he lied\nto get off punishment. The LW said the child shut down then and would not respond\n10",
    "to her like he had during his interview. The LW said that they had not reinterviewed\nthe youth, but the foster parent just directed him to say this.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12206 Staff qualifications.\n(1) An agency shall require that a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the rule as they reported that they\nwere not told of the adult brother staying in the home, however,\nprovided documentation (safety plan) that they were advised on\n03/04/21. Specifically, they were advised that the adult son,\nadult brother, and adult nephew were staying in the home and\nthat the brother and nephew would be sleeping in a room with\none of the foster children for safety, to provide supervision. No\naction was taken by the Licensing Supervisor or Licensing\nWorker related to this information and the adult brother was still\nin the home through the end of March. The Licensing Supervisor\nprovided inconsistent information from her interview when\ncompared to her email and the provided documentation. The\nLicensing Supervisor did not know who the nephew was or how\nhe was related. Neither the Licensing Supervisor nor Licensing\nWorker reported addressing the sleeping situation in the home\nor the adult household members residing there.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt has been established in the CPA Technical Assistance\nmanual for some time that licensing workers and CPAs are not\nto advise foster parents of allegations of abuse/neglect when\nworking with DHHS until the day of the interview. Neither the\nLicensing Worker nor Licensing Supervisor reported knowledge\nof this. It is recommended, given violation and this TA that both\nattend licensing complaint training again.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n11",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nDuring the course of this investigation, the agency provided their completed Special\nEvaluation Report for review. The report condensed multiple intakes into one special\nevaluation which is not the intention nor direction of the Department. In this case,\nintakes were noted to have been received 03/03/2021 and two on 03/24/21. Multiple\nallegations were made within these intakes, but the agency combined the special\nevaluations into one report. Upon review, this Special Evaluation Report,\n2021C0629544, did not contain sufficient information to support the findings. One\nsection referenced during a review of MiSACWIS information related to this Special\nEvaluation Report, it was found that there were several uploaded documents of\nnotes and other supporting information. This information is required to be\nsummarized in the Special Evaluation Report to describe and support the findings\nand not on separate documents. The report had no description of interviews with any\nrelated parties upon which to base the findings or conclusions.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(c) Conduct a thorough investigation including all\nnecessary collateral contacts.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of\nthe following information:\n(a) The date the information was received.\n(b) Identification of the information source, unless\nanonymous or confidential, as specified in the child\nprotection law, 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\n(c) The allegations.\n(e) Findings of fact, based upon the evaluation.\n(f) Conclusions regarding licensing rules compliance\nor noncompliance based on the findings of fact.\n(g) Any change in the agency’s decision regarding\nthe number, gender, age, race, ethnic background,\nand specific characteristics of children who may be\nplaced that is based upon the documentation\ncontained in the summary and conclusions of the\nreport.\n12",
    "ANALYSIS: The agency is in violation of the rule as they did not document a\nthorough investigation of the allegations. They combined\nmultiple intake allegations, some received three weeks apart,\ninto one report and did not clearly identify all the allegations and\nwhen they were received. CPS was identified in the report,\nwhich is protected information and must be coded as DHHS.\nThe findings and conclusions are not supported by documented\nfacts and information, as the agency failed to include the\nworker’s analysis of gathered information, or descriptions of\nfindings, observations and supporting documentation.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the agency submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nJune 08, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 14, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n13"
