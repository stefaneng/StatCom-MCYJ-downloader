    "Investigation Interviews:\nComplainant/Foster Parent.\nOn 1/8/2023 I attempted to contact the complainant by telephone;\nand on 1/19/2023, I spoke with Youth A’s foster father, Foster\nParent B by telephone.\nFoster Parent B confirmed the information indicated in the\ncomplaint and provided further details. He reported the agency\nhad been helpful to him and his wife Foster Parent C, so he\ndebated about complaining. He reported on 1/13/2023 instead of\nYouth A taking the bus to school, as she normally did, he drove\nher; and arranged for Youth A to speak to/stay with her counselor\nbecause they were concerned about Youth A having “free rein”\nand running away. He and his wife also took Youth A’s cell phone\ndue to those concerns, and arranged for FCW 3 to pick Youth A\nup from school because Youth A did not want him, or Foster\nParent C to pick her up.\nFoster Parent B reported when FCW 3 picked Youth A up, FCW 3\nworked out a safety plan with Youth A, around what Youth A could\ndo if she felt like running away, without their input. The plan was\nthat Youth A could go to Friend D’s home, who would call the\nagency. Friend D is a young lady whom Youth A met while placed\nin the foster home of Foster Parents B and C. Friend D lived with\nher family in the same neighborhood as Foster Parent B and C.\nFoster Parent B said he and Foster Parent C were not okay with\nthe safety plan, but they understood the agency’s need to put\nsomething in place. Foster Parent B expressed they were\nconcerned because they viewed Friend D’s mother as being too\nlenient Additionally, he expressed that Friend D had her own\n“issues.”\nFoster Parent B reported on Saturday (1/14/2023) Youth A was\ngone when he and Foster Parent C awakened. He and Foster\nParent C discovered Youth A had gone to a store. Youth A had\ncalled Parent E who picked her up and called the agency. The\nagency then called Foster Parents B and C to make them aware\nof the situation. Youth A reported she did not want to return to the\nfoster home. Foster Parent B reported Youth A had been\nconsistently expressing that she did not want to return to the foster\nhome.\nFoster Parent B reported the agency told him they were going to\nallow Youth A to remain in Parent E’s home until another\nplacement could be found. He said, when the agency realized\n3",
    "they could not get another placement timely; the agency reported\nthey would just let Youth A stay at Parent E’s (identified by the\nagency as a Kinship person), but Youth A’s legal placement would\nremain with him and Foster Parent C. Foster Parent B said, he\nand Foster Parent C disagreed with that proposed plan out of\npossible liability concerns, and around disturbing items they had\nseen on Youth A’s phone related to contacts with Friend D about\nYouth A sneaking out to meet men. Foster Parent B said he and\nFoster Parent C put in a 30-day removal request on 1/13/2023.\nHe and Foster Parent C rescinded that request and completed\npaperwork for Youth A’s immediate removal on 1/14/2023 or\n1/15/2023. Foster Parent B said the agency kept Youth A in\nParent E’s home. Youth A was still at Parent E’s home as of\n1/19/2023. The agency was looking for a residential placement for\nYouth A.\nAgency Staff Interviews\nOn 2/3/2023 I interviewed Program Manager 2, and FCW 3 onsite.\nThey both indicated Youth A knew Friend D and Friend D’s family\nfor a while prior to the agency allowing Youth A to live with the\nfamily. Youth A met Friend D and Parent E a year ago, via Youth\nA’s school. Parent E worked at the school, and she had Youth A\nover to their home several times prior to Youth A’s placement\nthere. Youth A was having friendship visits with Friend D and the\nfamily while Youth A was in placement with Foster Parent B and\nFoster Parent C. Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C allowed,\nand were okay with, those interactions until an incident in October\n2022.\nProgram Manager (PM) 2 reported FCW 3, is the agency’s\nlicensing manager whose has been serving in a dual role. FCW 3\nwas working with Youth A and Foster Parent B and Foster Parent\nC. PM 2 reported on 1/14/2023 she gave the verbal approval for\nYouth A to stay with Parent E’s family. The agency completed a\nwritten Relative Placement Safety Screen (MDHHS-5770)\nassessment on 1/24/2023.\nFCW 3 (Licensing Manager) affirmed that Youth A AWOLed on\n1/12/2023. Youth A reportedly ran to a male friend of her father’s.\nYouth A was returned to the foster home by the police. FCW 3\nsaid Youth A has a history AWOLing as well as, vaping, and\nmarijuana use, but Youth A did not begin AWOLing from this\nplacement until after a 10/31/2022 incident. On 10/31/2022,\nFoster Parent B picked Youth A up from Friend D’s Home, earlier\nthan planned, after discovering Youth A had not completed her\nhomework. At that time Youth A refused to go back to Foster\n4",
    "Parent B’s and Foster Parent C’s home. Youth A was upset about\nbeing picked up early, that the foster parents had taken her\nphone, and about other foster home family rules. Youth A refused\nto get in Foster Parent C’s car and FCW 3 was contacted. FCW 3\nencouraged Youth A to get in the car. At that time, Foster Parent\nC reported smelling marijuana on Youth A and Youth A gave an\nexcuse that it was due to Friend D’s whole house smelling of\nmarijuana. FCW 3 said she helped Youth A, and Foster Parent B\nand Foster Parent C work things out. She convinced the foster\nparents to give Youth A’s phone back and they all addressed\nYouth A completing her homework. FCW 3 reported throughout\nYouth A’s placement, with Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C,\nthey reported concerns with Youth A not being truthful and not\ncompleting her homework, which was not unusual for Youth A.\nFCW 3 said after Youth A ran on 1/12/2023, she was to complete\na well-child check on 1/13/2023. Her plan was to go to the foster\nhome, but after Foster Parent B advised her of Youth A’s refusal\nto come home with him from the school, she went to Youth A’s\nschool. She denied that she did not apprise Foster Parent B and\nFoster Parent C of what was going on with Youth A after she\npicked Youth A up from school on 1/13/2023. She said she\npicked Youth A up from school around 2:30PM. Youth A was\nanxious and very upset over her phone being taken, Foster Parent\nB and Foster Parent C being controlling, and issues with her\nfather. Youth A’s distress and anxiety was very visible, and to the\npoint that verbal intervention via New Oakland Crisis Center was\nsought to calm Youth A. FCW 3 said afterwards she took Youth A\nto McDonald’s to talk. She contacted Foster Parent B and Foster\nParent C by telephone and texted to let them know what was\ngoing on. She returned Youth A to the foster home around\n6:00PM and stayed for a while to get Youth A more stabilized.\nThey completed a safety plan during that time to identify things\nYouth A could do around AWOLing. FCW 3 reported the safety\nplan included:\n• Youth A calling the help network, and or FCW 3.\n• Youth A asking a to use the foster parent’s phone to make\nthe calls.\n• Youth A having time in her room or watching T. V. to de-\nstress.\n• Youth A having time alone, not being required to talk with\nFoster Parent B and Foster Parent C unless it’s her choice.\n• No cell phone media use, unless under one of the foster\nparent’s supervision with the foster parent’s phone.\n• If Youth A was to run away, she will go Friend D’s home.\n5",
    "FCW 3 said the foster parents agreed to the safety plan but did\nnot like it because they questioned whether it would avert Youth A\nfrom AWOLing. Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C also did not\nlike that Youth A would not talk with them about what she was\ngoing through. Nor that Youth A could use Youth A’s cell phone.\nThey were opposed to the latter because they had seen\ninappropriate pictures of a sexual nature, Youth A naked in a\nvideo on the phone, and an explicit text message between Youth\nA and a male person. Additionally, a text from Friend D to Youth A\nasking Youth A not to tell Parent E that Friend D was with a\ncertain person. FCW 3 reported those things and a belief that\nParent D would allow Youth A to use Friend D’s phone to reach\nout to inappropriate men fueled Foster Parent B’s and Foster\nParent C’s concern that Parent E’s home was not an appropriate\nplacement for Youth A. Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C\nwere concerned Parent E could not provide Youth A the level of\ncare and supervision they would/that Youth A needed.\nFCW 3 reported Youth A living with Parent E was not planned and\nthe family is not blood related to Youth A. Youth A identified the\nfamily as a safe place to stay in a safety plan that was developed\naround Youth A AWOLing. FCW 3 reported when Youth A ran the\nmorning of 1/14/2023 and refused to return to the foster home, the\nagency reached out to the licensed foster homes they have, that\ntypically take teens. The agency did not have a foster parent\nwilling to take placement of Youth A. At that point, the agency\nbelieved it was okay to leave Youth A in temporary placement with\nParent E and Parent F until Tuesday (1/17/2023), when they could\ncontact RPU (Regional Placement Unit) to conduct a statewide\nsearch for a residential placement. FCW 3 said the agency did\nnot reach out to the Department of Health and Human services\n(DHHS) or DHHS on-call at that time, because it was the\nweekend. They also believed Youth A was okay in Parent E’s and\nParent F’s home until the agency could finalize another placement\non that Tuesday, since Monday (1/16/2023) was a holiday.\nFCW 3 reported by 1/17/2023 they identified there was a\nbed/residential placement via Girl’s Town (a program through their\nagency); but the process through RPU was dragging on.\nAdditionally, Youth A’s birthday was near (2/3) and Youth A and\nFriend D’s family wanted to celebrate the birthday event together.\nFCW 3 said the re-placement process dragged on and Youth A\nremained with Parent E and Parent F. Youth A’s replacement was\npending for 2/13/2023.\n6",
    "FCW 3 reported meeting with Parent E on 1/13/2023 and she\nvisited the family’s home on 1/14/2023. She said Parent E stayed\nhome with Youth A on 1/17/2023 and brought Youth A to the\nagency for most of the day on 1/18/2023. FCW 3 reported daily\nphone contacts with Youth A and Friend D’s family. She\ncompleted ICHAT and central registry clearances for the Parent E\nand Parent F on 1/14/2023. She said she had not completed the\nclearances before because there was no placement exploration\nbefore. She did not observe any marijuana/substance concerns.\nShe said Youth A’s Guardian Ad Item (GAL) and DHHS case\nmonitor were aware of the placement situation with Youth A. Both\npersons attended a Team Decision Meeting (TDM) on Youth A’s\ncase, on 1/18/2023. She said, the GAL proposed completing a\nmotion to have the court do an order that stipulated to Youth A’s\nplacement at Parent E’s and Parent F’s home. She said the\nmotion was done, but held off on, because it had been agreed that\nYouth A would be placed in a residential setting. Additionally,\nParent E had made it clear they were not willing to plan for Youth\nA long term. FCW 3 said Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C\nattended the TDM but did not want Youth A to return to them, and\nthey were not supportive of Youth A’s placement with Parent E\nand Parent F. FCW 3 reported Foster Parent B and Foster Parent\nC felt Youth A should remain at the agency’s office until the\nresidential placement occurred. FCW 3 reported Foster Parent B\nand Foster Parent C are conscientious and caring people, but they\ntended to be very strict. Additionally, they were not allowing her to\ndo her job and they did not seem to fully understand various\nissues of trauma and how such would be impacting on Youth A’s\nbehaviors.\nReviewed:\nYouth A’s physical file and MISACWIS case record which\nshowed:\n• Youth A is a temporary court ward.\n• She was placed with Foster Parent B and Foster Parent C\nfrom 1/28/2022 until 1/14/2023.\n• She was placed with Parent E on 1/14/2023.\n• A Case Service Referral Acceptance -Individual Service\nAgreement (DHS-3600) for Guiding Harbor -Girls town for\nYouth A, effective 2/6/2023.\n• ICHAT clearances for Parent E and Parent F dated\n1/4/2023 which showed no criminal notations.\n• Undated Central registry and sex offender registry search\ndocumentation for Parent E and Parent F, which FCW\nreported completing on 1/14/2023, which showed no\nnoncompliance.\n7",
    "• A 2/15/2023 email from Foster Parent B to Chief\nAdministrator 1, FCW 3 and two other agency staff\nindicating their objection/concern with Youth A’s placement\nwith Parent E.\n• Copy of a Safety plan for Youth A as outlined above, in this\nreport.\n• A TDM dated 1/17/2023 via TEAMS that showed:\n➢ Attendance by the TDM facilitator, FCW 3, PM 2,\nGuiding Harbor’s licensing worker, and foster care\nsupervisor, Foster Parent B, Foster Parent C, the\nDHHS POS (Purchase of Service) Monitor and the\nPOS supervisor, Youth A’s father; Parent E, and\nYouth A’s GAL.\n➢ Youth A AWOLed on 1/13/2023 and again on\n1/14/2023. Youth A went to Friend D’s/Parent E’s\n(“fictive kin/support”) home and arrangements were\nmade for her temporary stay at this home over the\nweekend.\n➢ Youth A is currently at the office, but arrangements\nhave been made for her to stay the night at the\n“fictive kin/support” person’s home if a placement is\nnot located for her.\n➢ The foster parents are not willing to resume\nplacement and Youth A is refusing to return to the\nfoster home.\n➢ It is anticipated Youth A will remain with the “fictive\nkin/support” caregivers until her replacement,\npending completion of a MDHHS- 5770.\n• A 1/18/2023 MISACWIS social work contact entry by the\nTDM facilitator of all attendees for the 1/17/2023 TDM as\nlisted earlier in this section. The social work contact also\nindicated Youth A’s mother was invited but did not attend\nand Youth A refused to attend.\n• A DHHS-69 (Action Summary) documenting:\n➢ Youth A’s replacement from Foster Parent B’s and\nFoster Parent C’s foster home on 1/14/2023 to\nParent E’s and Parent D’s home.\n➢ Reason for the replacement.\n➢ The reason why Youth A’s replacement to her\nparents is not appropriate and feasible at this time.\n➢ Youth A’s legal parent/guardian were notified of the\nplacement change by telephone on 1/14/2023. That\nthe court was notified via email on the same date.\n• A copy of a MDHHS-5770 completed by FCW 3 on\n1/24/2023 and approved by PM 2 on 1/31/2023. The\n8",
    "agency recommended Youth A’s placement with Parent E\nand Parent F based on the following:\n➢ The family is willing to have Youth A stay at their\nhome until another placement is found.\n➢ The family has been a past foster and adoptive\nfamily and is somewhat familiar with the effects of\ntrauma.\n➢ The family has been fully informed of Youth A’s\nbehaviors and needs and they are willing to support\nand assist Youth A as needed until another\nplacement is found.\n➢ The family is aware of a safety plan put in place\nwhile Youth A was in placement with Foster Parent\nB and Foster Parent C and on 1/14/2023 and\n1/18/2023 Parent E agreed to follow that safety plan.\n➢ The agency assessed the placement as appropriate\nand suitable for an emergency/respite placement for\nYouth A.\n• Youth A ended up remaining in placement with Parent E\nand Parent F for 23 days.\nAnalysis The agency assessed Parent E’s and Parent F’s home, made\nYouth A’s DHHS worker, parents, and GAL aware of the\nplacement circumstances, and those individuals were in support of\nYouth A’s temporary placement with Parent E and F. The agency\nmade home calls to the home of Parent E and F to assess safety\nand found no problems. The agency described the family as a\nconnection/fictive kin.\nNotwithstanding the situation and the agency’s notable efforts, the\nagency is in noncompliance of the rule. The agency allowed Youth\nA’s to be placed in an unlicensed, unrelated home for 23 days\nfrom 1/14/2023 until 2/6/2023.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency current licensing status is recommended.\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date March 16, 2023\nLicensing Consultant\n9",
