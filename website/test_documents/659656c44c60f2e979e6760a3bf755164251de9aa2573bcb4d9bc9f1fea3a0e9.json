Complainant was contacted by phone on\n1/7/25. Complainant indicated Youth A stated he was sleeping on\nthe floor as punishment.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator was interviewed face-to-face at the facility\non 1/8/25. Chief Administrator reported Youth A briefly slept in the\nhallway, due to some youth having COVID and his room being\nused to quarantine the sick youth. Follow-up occurred with Chief\nAdministrator on 1/29/25. Chief Administrator clarified Youth A\nwas out of the facility, on a pass from 12/24/24 to 12/25/24. Youth\nA returned to the facility on 12/26/24. However, all bedrooms were\nfully occupied due to needing to use two bedrooms to quarantine\nCOVID positive youth. Therefore, Youth A slept in the hallway on\na mattress. The quarantine lasted until 1/6/25, at which time,\nYouth A was able to move back into his room. Youth A slept in the\nmiddle bed, of three beds in the room. On 1/7/25 Youth A moved\nto the bed closest to the door to due to being placed on increased\nsupervision. The bed closest to the door allowed for better\nsupervision of Youth A during sleeping hours. Youth A only slept\nin the hallway during the COVID quarantine.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25.\nYouth A stated he slept on a mattress in the hall for a few nights.\nYouth A reported he returned from a family visit and several youth\nhad COVID. Because of that, Youth A had to sleep on a mattress\nin the hallway. Youth A was provided with blankets and pillows for\nthe nights he was in the hallway. Youth A reported there was\nsome discussion about sleeping in the hall while on suicide\nprecautions, but that did not happen.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25.\nTherapist reported Youth A was on a pass to visit relatives over\nthe holidays. However, there was an incident during his visit, and\nhe returned to the agency earlier than expected. When Youth A\nreturned, his bedroom was unavailable. Youth A’s bedroom and\nanother bedroom were being used to quarantine youth that were\npositive for COVID. When everyone was healthy again, Youth A\nand his belongings returned to his room. Therapist recalled Youth\nA was out of his room for approximately nine days. Therapist\nnoted Youth A was placed on “individual focus” recently due to\n2",
    "statements that he wished to kill himself. Because of that, it was\nsuggested Youth A return to sleeping in the hallway at night so\nstaff could better supervise him. Therapist stated this was\ndiscussed as Youth A typically slept in the middle bed, of the three\nbeds in his room. However, it was later decided Youth A would\nmove to the bed closest to the doorway, not into the hallway.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25. Nurse\nreported Youth A returned from a pass and his room was in use\nby two youth that tested positive for COVID. More youth became\nill, and the unit ended up using two bedrooms to quarantine the\nsick youth. The decision was made to have Youth A sleep on a\nmattress in the hallway, as there was not another bed available.\nYouth A stated he was “okay” with that decision, but also stated\nhis rights were being violated.\nTour observation:\nYouth A’s bedroom was observed on 1/8/25. Youth A’s mattress\nwas placed on a frame, in his bedroom, with seasonally\nappropriate sheets, blankets and pillows.\nDocuments reviewed:\nCOVID-19 Emergency Plan dated 4/1/2020. “If resident\ndemonstrates positive symptoms of COVID-19, the following will\noccur: Resident will be placed in a room by himself, staff will be\nassigned to monitor him 1:1 24 hours a day. He will have access\nto his own bathroom.”\nConsultation\nConsultation was provided to the agency regarding their COVID\nEmergency Plan. As the plan was completed in 2020 and Center\nfor Disease Control guidance has evolved, the agency should\nupdate their plan. In addition, the 4/1/2020 plan did not address\nadditional sleeping areas that would be used in the event rooms\nwere occupied for quarantine. The updated plan should address\nthis issue. Lastly, although it did not occur in this situation, there\nwas discussion about having the youth sleep in the hallway while\non precautions. The agency was reminded this is not permitted.\nThe action to move the youth to the bed closest to the door for\nincreased supervision is appropriate and can be used in the\nfuture.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on interviews and\ndocuments reviewed, the agency followed their COVID\nEmergency Plan to quarantine youth. While sleeping on a\n3",
    "mattress on the floor was not ideal, it was temporary and\nnecessary to prevent the spread of COVID.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(b) Denial of any essential program service as punishment.\nThese include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(iv) Shelter, clothing, medical care, or essential personal\nneeds, including culturally specific items.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was denied access to their personal belongings.\nInvestigation On 1/7/25 Complainant reported Youth A was denied access to\nhis personal belongings.

Youth A confirmed he had access to hygiene\nand other necessary items as needed.\nTherapist was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25.\nTherapist reported Youth A was known to steal things from peers.\nYouth A had accumulated several items that did not belong to him,\nas well as items from a visit with relatives. Therefore, the decision\nwas made to put some of his belongings in storage while ensuring\nhe had access to necessary items. With fewer items in his room,\nstaff would be able to determine which belongings were his. Youth\nat the facility were typically permitted to have 7 days-worth of\nclothing in their room. Youth A had significantly more than that.\n4",
    "Youth A had 42 pair of underwear, 16 hoodies, and several pair of\nshoes. Many of these items were sent by relatives when Youth A\nreturned from a recent visit.

Since his return, Youth A made several self-harm\nstatements and was therefore placed on suicide precautions. As\nYouth A was under increased supervision, some items were not\naccessible, such as pencils and other sharp objects. Youth A\nexpressed to Therapist he was upset about the plan. Shortly after\nremoving the items, Therapist received an email from Youth A’s\ncase worker about the allegations and discussed it with Youth A.\nYouth A was smiling throughout the discussion, as if he thought it\nwas funny.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/8/25. Nurse\nreported Youth A returned from a pass with a significant amount of\nclothing. Nurse went through his clothes and pulled out enough\nclothing for 7 days, to be stored in his bedroom. All other items\nwere packed in totes and placed in storage. Nurse provided\nphotos of all of Youth A’s clothing, to ensure they could account\nfor all of his belongings in storage. The photos were viewed by\nDCWL. Nurse reported she was present with Youth A for a\nconversation regarding this allegation. Youth A implied that the\nsituation was funny and laughed that the facility could be shut\ndown.\nTour observation:\nA walk through of the facility was completed on 1/8/25. Youth A’s\nbedroom was viewed. Youth A had a storage tote and shelves for\nhis personal items. Several outfits consisting of pants, shirts,\nsweatshirts, socks, underwear, and shoes were observed.\nDocuments reviewed:\nA current “list of belongings” outlining the items available to Youth\nA in his bedroom detailed the following items:\n• 5 sweatpants\n• 13 pair of socks\n• 8 t-shirts\n• 1 A-line shirt\n• 3 sweatshirts\n5",
