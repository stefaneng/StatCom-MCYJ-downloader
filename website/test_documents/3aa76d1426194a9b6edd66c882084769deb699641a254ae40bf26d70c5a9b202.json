EMT 1 reported she and EMT 2 were called to\nthe hospital to take Youth A back to the facility on 6/9/24. EMT 1\nreported Youth A told hospital staff she was scared to go back to\nthe facility. However, Youth A was sweet, calm, and cooperative,\nand got onto the stretcher fine with no objection. EMT 1 reported\nin the ambulance, Youth A reported she wasn’t safe at the facility,\nthere was a lot of verbal abuse going on and “they” were going to\nhurt her. EMT 1 reported Youth A did not specify whether the\nverbal abuse was by youth or staff and did not provide any\nexamples. Youth A also did not specify whether she was afraid of\nbeing harmed by youth or staff. EMT 1 reported she offered to talk\nto someone about what Youth A was experiencing at the facility,\nbut Youth A got very wide-eyed and said, “No, no, no, don’t do\nthat. It’ll make it worse”. EMT 1 reported Youth A had a bruise on\n2",
    "her forearm but didn’t want to elaborate on how she received the\nbruise. EMT 1 reported Youth A was still in the hospital gown\nwhen she arrived back at the facility. EMT 1 reported a male staff\nand a female staff escorted EMT 1, EMT 2, and Youth A on the\nstretcher to the facility. EMT 1 reported there was a Caucasian\nfemale staff with dark hair and glasses who was on the unit when\nthey arrived. EMT 1 reported Youth A asked the female staff if she\ncould go to her room and change out of her hospital gown, but the\nfemale staff yelled at Youth A and said, “No you can’t go back to\nyour room. You made the choices you did yesterday, so this is\nyour fault why you can’t go back to your room”. EMT 1 reported\nthe response seemed very uncalled for and inappropriate.\nEMT 2 was interviewed via phone on 6/10/24. EMT 2 reported\nwhen she and EMT 1 arrived at the hospital to transport Youth A\nback to the facility, Youth A began freaking out and acting scared.\nEMT 2 reported Youth A said she was dizzy, lightheaded, was\nprediabetic, and didn’t know why she was being sent back to the\nfacility when it wasn’t safe there. EMT 2 reported Youth A had a\nbruise on her forearm, but hospital staff and Youth A did not tell\nEMT 1 or EMT 2 where the bruise came from. Youth A told EMT 2\nshe didn’t want to go back to the facility because “they” are\nverbally abusive, but Youth A did not specify whether it was youth\nor staff. Youth A did not provide any names for youth or staff who\nwere verbally abusive towards her. EMT 2 reported when they\narrived at the residence hall, there was a female staff behind the\nreception desk. EMT 2 reported Youth A asked the female staff if\nshe could go to her room to get changed. EMT 2 reported the\nfemale staff was aggressive and forceful in her response and said\n“No, you can’t go back there. You know why you can’t go to your\nroom”. EMT 2 reported Youth A was very polite in her interactions,\nbut the female staff’s reaction was loud, aggressive, unnecessary,\nand made EMT 2 very uncomfortable.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/11/24.\nYouth A reported all staff except Staff 3, Staff 4, Staff 5, Staff 6,\nand Staff 7 are verbally abusive, but could not provide any\nexamples of verbal abuse she has witnessed or been victim of.\nYouth A reported staff can be threatening by saying “Alright, y’all\nwant to act like this. I got something for y’all” and proceed to shut\ndown the program. Youth A could not name a specific staff\nmember who has said that and could not name any other ways\nany staff have been threatening. Youth A reported Supervisor 2 is\nthe staff who gets mad when youth ask to have doors opened, or\nrequest items. Youth A reported Supervisor 2 frequently yells at\nthem and shows she’s irritated. Youth A reported on 6/9/24, she\n3",
    "arrived on the unit after being brought back from the hospital, and\nStaff 4 was fine, but Supervisor 2 was not. Youth A reported she\nasked Supervisor 2 if she could go to her bedroom to get\nchanged, and Supervisor 2 told her no. Youth A reported\nSupervisor 2 did not yell at her or speak to her inappropriately.\nYouth A reported she was irritated Supervisor 2 wouldn’t let her\nget clothes out of her room, but Supervisor 2 and Therapist talked\nto her and explained why, so she understood even though she\nwasn’t happy about it. Youth A reported she when she told EMT 1\nand EMT 2 about being fearful of someone physically harming\nher, she was speaking about Youth C because they weren’t on\ngood terms prior to Youth A going to the hospital. Youth A\nreported no staff at the facility have physically harmed her. Youth\nA reported the bruising on her forearm/wrist came from her falling\nwhen she was running through the woods on 6/8/24 when she\nwent AWOL. Youth A reported Staff 1 cusses at youth sometimes\nand has told her she needs to “get her shit together”. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 is very stern, and he becomes angry very quickly,\nwhich he demonstrates by being loud. Youth A reported one time\nStaff 1 told a youth (couldn’t remember who), “I’m so sick of your\nfucking bullshit”. Youth A reported when Staff 1 reacts in those\nways or becomes loud, it scares her.\nYouth B and Youth D were interviewed separately face to face\nat the facility on 6/20/24. Youth B and Youth D reported they do\nnot have any concerns with staff’s interactions with youth. Youth B\nand Youth D reported no staff yell, scream, cuss, or threaten\nyouth.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/20/24.\nYouth C reported there are certain staff, such as Supervisor 2,\nwho will match energies of the youth they are interacting with.\nYouth C reported if she yells at Supervisor 2, then Supervisor 2\nmight raise her voice or yell back. Youth C reported the only times\nshe has heard any staff yell is when they’re trying to get a youth’s\nattention during an escalated situation, but not as a sign of\ndisrespect or being verbally abusive. Youth C reported she has\nnever heard any staff yell, scream, cuss, or threaten any youth\nexcept Staff 1. Youth C reported one time around Mother’s Day\n2024, Staff 1 was asked to stay and work a double shift, and she\nheard him say “this is fucking irritating”, but he wasn’t cussing at a\nyouth. Youth C reported another time she was escalated, and\nStaff 1 said, “If this was out in the real world, I would put my hands\non you”. Youth C reported recently she was talking to another\nyouth about her history and expressed her frustration about being\nin the foster care system since she was 11 years old without a\n4",
    "family wanting to adopt her. Youth C reported Supervisor 2 was\nlistening to the conversation and scoffed when Youth C mentioned\na family. Youth C reported she became frustrated and asked\nSupervisor 2 to stop because it was bothering her. Youth C\nreported Supervisor 2 said “well that’s why you’re here, because\nno family wants you”.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 6/11/24. CA reported the female staff who was present\non the unit on 6/9/24 and matches EMT 1’s description was\nSupervisor 2. CA reported Supervisor 2’s tone of voice and pace\ncan come off wrong to youth and staff, so it is a continued work in\nprogress being addressed with her.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n6/11/24. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A has a low IQ and has\nPTSD, which frequently manifest in misrepresentation of facts and\nnuances of social interactions with others. Supervisor 1 reported\nYouth A perceives people not doing what she wants or putting\nboundaries up as “abuse” or “disrespect”. Supervisor 1 reported\nwhenever Youth A has brought him a concern about staff, he has\nfollowed up on the concerns by reviewing paperwork, conducting\ninternal investigations, or sending the information to the recipient’s\nrights office for investigation. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A has\nhad specific complaints about every staff who works at the facility\nat one time or another. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A has\ncomplained Supervisor 2 is too loud, speaks too quickly, or\nspeaks over her. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A has never\ncomplained any staff have been verbally abusive towards her.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A has never complained about Staff\n1 cussing at her, and Youth C has never complained about Staff 1\nthreatening her. Supervisor 1 reported no staff, including Staff 1,\nhave ever been mandated for a shift, so he’s not sure where\nYouth C received her information for her complaint about Staff 1\ncussing.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/20/24.\nStaff 1 reported he has never heard any staff yell, scream, cuss,\nor threaten any youth. Staff 1 reported he hasn’t seen Supervisor\n2 do any of those things either, but sometimes she gets into power\nstruggles with youth, which he doesn’t feel are always necessary.\nStaff 1 reported his voice is deep and loud, but he doesn’t ever\nraise his voice or yell at youth. Staff 1 reported he is a tall and\nstocky male, and knows he has to be very self-aware in his\ninteractions with others, especially female youth. Staff 1 reported\nhe knows his voice tends to carry, so when he is speaking directly\n5",
    "to a youth, he provides reassurances such as “I’m not yelling” or\n“I’m not upset”, to ensure his intentions are understood. Staff 1\nreported cussing is not in his verbiage, and he has never said the\nstatements Youth A or Youth C reported. Staff 1 reported when he\nis speaking to the youth, he is respectful, even to the point of\nsaying “yes ma’am” or “no ma’am”. Staff 1 reported he has never\nworked a double shift or been forced to stay after his shift, so he\nisn’t sure what situation Youth C is referring to. Staff 1 reported he\ntries to teach the youth life lessons, and sometimes he provides\nreal life examples of consequences for behaviors to prepare them\nfor life outside of the facility. Staff 1 reported youth are quick to\nbecome physically or verbally assaultive with each other or staff,\nso he might say “if you were to put hands on someone outside of\nthe facility, there could be consequences (i.e. physical fight,\ngetting shot, etc.), and staff won’t be there to redirect you, so you\nhave to change your behaviors”. Staff 1 reported he is always\nreminding the youth their goal is to get out of the facility, and they\nneed to grow so they’re prepared for the real world. Staff 1\nreported he has never threatened to put his own hands on the\nyouth or threatened to use physical violence against any of the\nyouth.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 7/17/24. Staff 4 reported\nshe was present on 6/9/24 when EMT 1 and EMT 2 brought Youth\nA back to the facility. Staff 4 reported when Youth A returned,\nYouth A asked Supervisor 2 if she could go into her room and get\nchanged. Staff 4 reported Supervisor 2 let Youth A know she was\nmoved to a stripped room for suicide precautions, so she could\nnot go into her room. Staff 4 reported when Supervisor 2\nresponded, she wasn’t loud, aggressive, or inappropriate. Staff 4\nreported Supervisor 2 and Youth A went down a bedroom hallway\nto have a private conversation, but she didn’t hear what they were\nsaying. Staff 4 reported Youth A and Supervisor 2’s interactions\ntypically tend to be louder in nature, but she didn’t hear an\nescalated or loud conversation between them in the hallway. Staff\n4 reported Youth A and Supervisor 2 have a unique relationship,\nwhich ends up being more like a mother-daughter relationship.\nStaff 4 reported they have disagreements and arguments, but\nYouth A gets over them quickly. Staff 4 reported she has never\nseen or heard any staff scream, threaten, yell at, or cuss at Youth\nA.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 7/17/24.
