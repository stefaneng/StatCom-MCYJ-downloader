    "INVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Complainant 1 via telephone on January 28, 2021. She reported she\noverheard a conversation on January 17, 2021 where Staff 1 and Youth A were\ntogether after Youth A was discharged from Wedgwood. She also reported she was\ninformed by another person in her home that Youth A and Staff 1 were in an intimate\nrelationship. However, the person later said they were not being truthful.\nI interviewed Youth A via telephone on January 25, 2021 in collaboration with\nMDHHS worker. Youth A stated he knows Staff 1 as she worked at Wedgwood and\nthey had a brother/sister like relationship. Youth A denied having any relationship\nwith Staff 1. Since he left the facility, he has had no contact with her. Youth A\nreported his aunt began to make false accusations of him being in a relationship with\nStaff 1. He does not know why she did this, only reporting while he was on the\ntelephone with another girl, his aunt claimed he was talking with Staff 1.\nI interviewed the Foster Care Case Manager on January 25, 2021 via telephone. He\nreported he was informed by Youth A’s family members that Youth A is in an\nintimate relationship with Staff 1. Youth A plans to reside with her and he has spent\ntime with her since he was discharged from Wedgwood. No specific information was\nprovided regarding the length of time Staff 1 and Youth A have been in a\nrelationship.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on January 28, 2021. She denied having an\nintimate relationship with Youth A. She denied having any contact with him following\nhis discharge from Wedgwood.\nI interviewed Assistant Supervisor and Therapist at the facility on January 28, 2021\nand House Supervisor via telephone on January 28, 2021. They all reported no\nknowledge or reports of Staff 1 having an intimate relationship with Youth A, until\nthese allegations in January 2021.\nAssistant Supervisor additionally reported she had multiple conversations with Staff\n1 due to boundary concerns but not of a sexual nature. She stated Staff 1 was\nassigned a goal worker for Youth A. She had received complaints by other youth\nthat Staff 1 showed favoritism with Youth A. She also received complaints by staff of\nStaff 1 buying items for youth, braiding youth hair, standing by youth’s bedroom\ndoor, and wrestling with Youth A on one occasion. Assistant Supervisor stated that\nYouth A was upset on at least two occasions ,crying, as Staff 1 was not working and\nhe wanted to talk with her. In the Fall, Assistant Supervisor changed Youth A’s goal\nworker due to the continued boundary concerns.\nAssistant supervisor provided three supervision notes dated 2/24/20, 5/5/20 and\n1/7/21 with Staff 1 where they discussed boundaries concerns that included braiding\nyouth hair, giving gifts to youth, wrestling with youth, and alleged dating of Staff 1.\n3",
    "I reviewed Staff 1’s disciplinary record and she does not have any disciplinary record\nsince her employment in November 2017. I reviewed Staff 1’s training record. She\nparticipated in multiple trainings that address appropriate boundaries with youth.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in compliance as there is no information to\nsupport Youth A and Staff 1 were in an intimate relationship\nwhile he resided at Wedgwood.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance regarding\nsupervision and documentation. During Assistant Supervisor’s\ninterview, she reported she had concerns and many\nconversations with Staff 1 regarding her boundaries. There\nwere three conversation within a year documented in\nsupervision notes. Assistant Supervisor changed Youth A’s\ngoal worker from Staff 1 due to these concerns. Even following\nthe conversations, Staff 1 continued to engage in concerning\nbehaviors, specifically gift giving. There were no disciplinary\nreports on file for Staff 1. When boundary issues are present,\nconsistent supervision should be provided, documented and\ndiscussed to prevent further issues. If staff are not changing\ntheir behavior, disciplinary action should be sought.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nA staff member in providing gifts to a youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring interviews with Staff 1, Assistant Supervisor, House Supervisor, Therapist,\nYouth A and Youth B (who was interviewed at the facility on January 28, 2021), they\nall reported staff give youth gifts. These gifts have included cards, gift cards, pens,\nclothes, holiday bags and Nintendo switch. Staff reported conflicting information\nregarding the gift giving practice. Gifts can be given if you are giving all the youth the\nsame gift, if the gift is not too excessive, or if you are their goal worker.\n4",
    "I reviewed Wedgwood Professional Staff Relationships Procedure. This policy\nprohibits staff from spending their own money on youth with rare exceptions allowed\non special occasions, and only with prior approval from clinician and home\nsupervisor.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents'\nneeds, implementation of treatment plans, and discharge of\nresidents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as staff are using their\nown money to provide a variety of gifts to youth without getting\npermission from clinician and home supervisor. Additionally,\nstaff were unaware of what direction the Wedgwood policy\nprovides.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSpecial Investigation 2020C0223046, CAP approved\n10/14/20\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended, upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, no changes\nbe made to the status of the license of this child caring institution.\nFebruary 1, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 2, 2021\n5",
