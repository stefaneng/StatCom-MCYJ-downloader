After the restraints, Youth A reported Staff 3 had his knee on\nhis back and was bending and twisting Youth A's arm. Youth A is now complaining\nthat his arm hurts.

He provided the requested paperwork including the safety plan\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "for Youth A. He denied witnessing the incident but speaking to Youth A the next day\nand then making the report to DHHS. Youth A told him he has “issues with Staff 3”\nand Youth A “bragged about wanting to get Staff 3 into trouble”. He reported Staff 3\nas the identified staff and Supervisor 1 and Staff 1 as witnesses to the incident. Staff\n3 has worked at the facility for the past nine plus years Administrator 1 reported the\ntechnique used in the restraint was approved and taught to all staff. He also reported\n“if a youth goes to the ground, staff are to disengage and help them back to their\nfeet. Two staff will engage in a Team Control which involves staff on each side of the\nyouth holding their arm and shoulder with their leg in front of the youth. Staff’s hips\nare to be next to the youth’s hip for support”. He was asked about the delay in\nmedical treatment for Youth A and reported a wellness check was completed by the\nsupervisor on site and it was determined that medical care was not needed at the\ntime. He reported staff witnessed Youth A engage in several actions such as\npunching and pounding on a glass window and door to playing basketball following\nthe incident. He reported these actions supported staff’s decision to not provide\noutside medical care at the time.\nI interviewed Administrator 2 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the\nfacility on 9/9/2021. He reported being aware of the incident but not present at the\ntime of the incident. He took Youth A to the doctor’s office on Tuesday, September\n7th. Youth A told the doctor that he had pain in his left shoulder and left arm. The\ndoctor asked him about the marks on his face and Youth A said the “marks were\ncaused by him picking pimples”. The x-rays were negative, and Youth A received a\ntetanus shot for the abrasions.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the\nfacility on 9/9/2021. She reported entering the incident and observing Staff 1 and\nStaff 3 engaged in a Team Control with each staff on a different side of Youth A,\nholding his arm with one hand on his shoulder. Youth A was “cursing, spiting and\nthreatening to kill Staff 3 if the staff did not let go of him”. She attempted to\ndeescalate Youth A and eventually switched out with Staff 3 because he appeared\nto be the focus of Youth A’s anger and Youth A threatened to get Staff 3 fired. Youth\nA kept trying to drop his weight and the two staff would release him and help him\nback to his feet. She denied the allegations of Youth A’s arm being twisted or a staff\nplacing their knee in his back. She reported the behavior management techniques\nshe observed were appropriate. Youth A threatened her with being fired because\nshe didn’t take him to the doctor when he reported his arm was broken. She\nreported he finally calmed down and he left the area with her. A few minutes after\nthis, Youth A started walking around campus and ended up at the administration\nbuilding. She reported he was “pounding on the door and windows in a very violent\nmanner with both arms” after saying his arm was broken. She reported his actions\nwith his arms lead her to believe that he didn’t need medical care at the time. She\ntold Youth A at the time that there didn’t appear to be anything wrong with is arm\nbecause of his actions. Supervisor 1 reported she is trained to observe the reported\ninjury and determine if additional medical help is needed and believing that it was\nnot.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the facility on\n9/9/2021. He reported being part of the incident with Youth A and described the\nincident stating, “Youth A was having a good day up until we went to the gym. While\nin the gym he asked to go back to the house to get his water bottle and I told him\nthat he could just use the drinking fountain in the gym. Youth A said he would go\nmobile (described when a youth leaves the area without permission and staff must\nfollow the youth) and left the gym with Staff 3 following him.” Staff 1 followed behind\nthem and when he caught up to them, Youth A was attempting to climb through a\nwindow into the house. He initiated a Team Control which he described as\nSupervisor 1 had described after Staff 3 positioned himself to keep Youth A from\nclimbing through the window. Youth A became very aggressive and began to\nthreaten and spit on Staff 3. This led to the restraint of Youth A. Staff 1 reported\n“Staff 3 had Youth A’s arm too high for my comfort and I told him to lower his arm\nwhich he did immediately”. Youth A began to say Staff 3 was twisting his arm at this\ntime and increased his threats towards Staff 3. He reported Youth A dropped his\nweight causing the three of them to move forward with Youth A going to the ground.\nBoth staff released Youth A at this time before helping him back to his feet. They\nattempted to escort Youth A to a “safer area without rough ground” but during the\nescort, Youth A continued to be very aggressive and dropped his weight again. Staff\n1 reported, Supervisor 1 came onto the scene at this time and swapped positions\nwith Staff 3. Youth A walked to a bench with Supervisor 1 and told staff to call an\nambulance because he believed his arm was broken. Staff 1 reported going to get\nwater for Youth A at which time, Youth A left the bench and went to the maintenance\nshed where he began to pound on the door with both hands. Youth A then walked to\nthe Administration building where he began to pound on the windows and door with\nhis arms. He reported Supervisor 1 let him into the building and he calmed down but\nwas still demanding that staff call child protective services. Staff 1 reported Youth A\nhas been having issues with Staff 3 and doesn’t like him. He also reported this was\nover Staff 3 confronting him for being on an inappropriate website during school and\ntaking the computer away. He reported the restraint and behavior management\ntechniques used were appropriate and denied any twisting of his arm or a knee in\nhis back. He reported the marks on Youth A’s face were caused by the dirt and\nrough ground when he dropped his weight and went to the ground. He also reported\nthere were other youth at the administration building for a work session, but he is\nunsure if they observed the incident. He identified three staff (Staff 2, Staff 4, and\nStaff 6) as staff with the other youth and possible witnesses. Staff 1 reported\nobserving Youth A using his hurt arm to play basketball and was throwing a ball in a\ngame at the house following the incident.\nI interviewed Youth A in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the facility\non 9/9/2021. He began the interview by reporting an incident with Staff 3 prior to the\nrestraint. He reported Staff 3 came to his room one hour before the incident and\nsaid, “I’m not playing with you today and will slap the shit out of you”. He also\nreported Staff 3 blocked his exit from the room and he responded by saying he only\nwanted to read his book. He reported Youth B was witness to this exchange.

    "A reported forgetting his water bottle in the house as the underlying reason he asked\nto return to the house for the water bottle during the time in the gym. He left the gym\nafter being told he could not go back to the house. He reported being told by Staff 3\nthat “no one was going to let me in the house” so he went to the side and opened\nthe window. Youth A reported, “as I opened the window, Staff 3 grabbed my arm and\nslammed me”. He reported, Staff 3 “wrapped my arm around my neck and when he\nslammed me on the ground, he had his knee in my back pushing down and pulling\nmy arm behind me”. Youth A reported hearing a “popping noise” and he began to\nscream. He reported Staff 1 came to help after being slammed to the ground by Staff\n3. Staff 1 told him to “chill out” several times before telling Staff 3 to let him up. Staff\n3 let him up only to slam him on the ground a second time. He reported landing on\nhis face when Staff 3 slammed him to the ground. He also reported other youth were\nwatching him at this time but was unable to identify who these youth were. He\nreported Staff 3 “slammed me four more times before Supervisor 1 showed up and\nswitched out with Staff 3”. He told Supervisor 1 prior to the switch that Staff 3 was\nattempting to break his arm. He reported having a “panic attack and not being able\nto breath” while sitting on the bench with Supervisor 1. He reported “Youth B\nwitnessed the whole incident” and Staff 4 was also present. Youth A reported he\nwas unable to move his arm the rest of the day following the incident and did not\nparticipate in basketball or any other activities.\nI interviewed Youth B in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the facility\non 9/9/2021. He reported living in the same house as Youth A but did not report any\nawareness of any situation between Youth A and Staff 3 in the house prior to the\ngroup going to the gym. He gave a similar report to the situation with the water\nbottle, and he observed the restraint from the gym. He reported seeing a knee on\nYouth A’s back but was unable to identify who’s knee it was. At first, he reported\nobserving staff slam Youth A to the ground but changed his story to only observing\nStaff 3 grab Youth A’s arm. He also reported Staff 1, Staff 3, and Staff 5 were\npresent. Youth A was in the gym after the incident “shooting hoops” and later playing\na ball game in the house.\nI interviewed Youth C in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the facility\non 9/9/2021. He reported living in the same house as Youth A and reported only\nwitnessing Youth A “drop” from the gym. He further explained “drop” meant Youth A\ndropped his weight while being restrained and staff released him. Youth A appeared\nto be struggling with the restraint. Four staff were present at the time of the restraint\nincluding Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Supervisor 1. He also reported observing\nYouth A’s arm and stated, “his arm turned purple”. He reported observing staff bend\nYouth A’s arm and being told by staff that he should not say anything. He was\nunable to identify the staff that told him this. He reported talking to all staff and\nhaving them tell him that Youth A’s arm was alright.\nI interviewed Staff 2 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the facility on\n9/9/2021. He reported being with another group of youth in front of the\nAdministration building when he heard Youth A screaming. He observed Youth A in\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "a standing restraint with Staff 1 and Staff 3. He never observed Youth A on the\nground and what he observed of the restraint was appropriate. He described the\naction staff are to take when a youth drops their weight during a restraint in a similar\nmanner to the other descriptions by staff.\nI interviewed Staff 3 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist at the facility on\n9/9/2021. He reported expectations were given to all the youth prior to the activity in\nthe gym. Youth A left the gym after Staff 1 told him he could not leave to go back\nand get his water bottle. Staff 3 reported following Youth A to the house and to the\nwindow Youth A attempted to enter. He stood near Youth A to keep him from going\nthrough the window to which Youth A responded with a “fighting position and spiting\non me”. Staff 1 was present and both placed Youth A in a team control position. He\ngave a similar description of the actions of both staff and Youth A as described by\nStaff 1. He reported Youth A spit on him several times and was threating to kill him if\nnot released. Youth A dropped his weight twice causing him to go to the ground at\nwhich time they disengaged. He reported trying to escort Youth A to a safer location\nbefore Supervisor 1 switched position with him. He denied engaging in a restraint\nwhile Youth A was on the ground and never putting his knee in Youth A’s back. He\nreported Youth A went to the ground twice after dropping his weight which caused\nthe staff to also fall but not on top of Youth A. Staff 1 informed him that he was\nholding Youth A’s arm too high of a position, so he lowered the arm at which time,\nYouth A began to say his arm was broken. He reported he left the situation but was\ncalled for assistance to help Staff 1 after Youth A went “mobile” again. Once arriving\nback on the scene, he found Staff 1 and Youth A near the Administration building\nwith Youth A banging on the windows and door. Staff 3 reported Youth A was\ncomplaining of a broken arm while using this arm to bang on the windows and door.\nFollowing the incident, Staff 3 observed Youth A playing basketball in the gym and\n“dribbling with both hands”. He reported following the behavior management\ntechniques and engaging in an appropriate restraint.\nI interviewed Staff 4 by phone on 9/14/2021. She stated, “I didn’t see enough to\nbe helpful”. She reported being near the administration building when Youth D said,\n“Youth A was tackled by Staff 3”. She also reported not being able to hear anything\nbecause they were using lawn mowers at the time. She reported observing Staff 3\nlaying on top of Youth A and after calling for “emergency procedures, Staff 1 came\non the scene and placed Youth A into a “team control”.\nI interviewed Staff 5 by phone on 9/14/2021. She reported being the third staff\nwith the youth in the gym. Staff 1 and Staff 3 left to deal with Youth A and after\ngetting the emergency call, she began the process of escorting the other youth to\nthe house. She reported several other youth attempted to go into the hallway to\nwatch but she redirected them back into the gym to pick up the basketballs. She\nreported never witnessing Youth A or the two staff on the ground. She also reported\nnever observing the twisting of Youth A’s arm or a knee in his back. She reported\nobserving Youth A getting his arm free during the standing restraint and attempting\nto hit Staff 3.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "I interviewed Staff 3 by phone on 9/14/2021. He confirmed that Youth A did take a\nswing at him and spit on him as the reasons to initiate the restraint. He also reported\nStaff 5 observed Youth A take a swing at him while Youth A was being held in the\nteam control position. He reported not sharing Youth A tried to swing at him during\nthe first interview because “I thought you already knew about it from reading the\nincident report”.\nI interviewed Staff 6 by phone on 9/16/2021. She reported being with another\ngroup of youth at the administration building during the time the incident with Youth\nA took place. She heard Youth A yell and turned around to see what was happening.\nIt looked like only Staff 3 was present with Youth A before Staff 1 showed up. Both\nstaff were standing next to Youth A when he went to the ground. She reported “it\nlooked like Staff 3 was also on the ground, but I couldn’t tell if he was on top of\nYouth A or not”.\nI interviewed Youth D in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist by video\nconference on 9/20/2021. He reported being involved in a work session at the\nadministration building when he observed Youth A coming out of the house. He also\nreported operating a lawn mower at the time and his focus was more on the lawn\nmower than the incident. He reported not being able to identify the two staff but\nreported observing “Youth A was on the ground with staff trying to hold him still”. He\ndenied observing Staff 3 on top of Youth A while Youth A was on the ground. He\nreported being confused about Youth A yelling his arm was broken when he\nobserved Youth A playing basketball later in the day.\nI interviewed Youth A in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist by video\nconferencing on 9/30/2021. He gave the same information that he reported in the\nfirst interview. He also reported the injury to his face was caused when he was\n“slammed on the ground”. He reported being on his stomach while on the ground\nwith Staff 3 having a knee in his back.\nI interviewed Staff 1 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist by video\nconferencing on 9/30/2021. He reported the same information given during the first\ninterview. He reported both Youth A and Staff 3 were standing when he reached\nthem, and Staff 3 was standing between Youth A and the window. He reported there\nwas “not enough time for Staff 3 to put Youth A on the ground” before he showed up.\nHe reported the marks on Youth A’s face occurred “when he dropped his weight”. He\nreported the reason for the restraint was Youth A’s “risky behavior” of trying to get\nthrough the window. He denied observing Youth A try to hit Staff 3.\nI interviewed Staff 3 in collaboration with the DHHS Specialist by video\nconferencing on 9/30/2021. He reported never touching Youth A until Youth A\n“stepped back in a fighting stance and took a swing”. He gave two different reports\nabout the location of Staff 1 when Youth A attempted to hit him. He first reported\nStaff 1 was present and then reported not knowing where Staff 1 was at the time. He\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "described his reaction to the swing, “I stopped the swing with my right arm when I\nput a bear hug on his arm which was across my chest and his arm was under my\narm”. He denied placing Youth A in a prone position and reported the only time\nYouth A was in a prone position was when he dropped his weight and went to the\nground. He denied observing any marks on Youth A’s face and reported an\nunderstanding that if a youth is spitting on a staff the youth can be restrained.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\nI reviewed the video footage of Youth A playing basketball and using both arms\nseveral hours after the restraint and Youth A stating his arm was broken.\nI reviewed the HR documents for Staff 3. There was no disciplinary action located\nwithin the file.\nI reviewed the Residential Initial Treatment Plan for Youth A. This document is dated\n7/7/21 and covers a period of 6/9/21 to 7/7/21. Goals identified included learning to\ncope with his emotions in a safe and productive manner and understanding\nconsequences relative to negative behavior patterns under the Peer/Adult social\nrelationships domain.\nI reviewed the documents from the doctor’s visit by Youth A on 9/7/21. The\ndocument is dated 9/7/21 and identifies the reason for the visit as “Shoulder Pain”.\nAlso identified as “Current Visit Problem(s)/problem list” are injury due to altercation,\nelbow abrasion, muscle strain of left scapular region and strain of left elbow. “Plan of\nCare” has instructions of “Ice, Gentle Rom. Keep abrasion clean and dry, report\nsigns of infection, recheck 2-3 days if any problems. Tetanus was given today.\nPlease update your records.” (there was no mention of the marks on Youth A’s face)\nI reviewed the incident report of the restraint that occurred on 9/4/21.This document\nlists staff involved as Staff 1 and Staff 3. It also lists the following staff as witnesses,\nStaff 1, Staff 2, and Staff 5. Youth A is listed as the Youth A involved. This report\npresents the same as the statements by Staff 1 and Staff 3 reported. This document\nstates “Youth A turned to Staff 3 in an aggressive, challenging position and tried to\ntake a swing”. It is also documented that staff completed a “wellness check” on\nYouth A. It is documented, “Youth A complained his left arm hurt but was able to\nmove it and some scratches on the side of his face”.\nI reviewed the medical procedures for the facility. This document states “if a medical\nsituation occurs that appears to be an emergency, take all necessary steps to\nensure the safety, comfort and proper care of the student. Then contact the Resident\nManager / Supervisor in Charge advise of the emergency and act on their\ninstructions.”\nI reviewed the behavior management policy/procedure. The policy states staff are to\ndisengage in a restraint if a youth drops weight and reengage once they are\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "standing again if needed. Staff can help bring the youth back up to his knees or a\nstanding position without the use of force.\nI reviewed the “Non-Violent Crisis Intervention” manual used by the facility for the\nphysical management of youth.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Although there was not consistent evidence to support Staff 3\nhad his knee on Youth A’s back and twisted Youth A's arm, the\nfacility is found in non-compliance as Staff 3 did not use proper\nrestraint technique.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe facility followed their protocol in response to Youth A\nreporting he was injured. However, it is recommended the\nfacility protocol be updated to include a medical professional\nassessment be obtained if a youth reports an injury.\nAdditionally, the facility’s nurse recently resigned.
