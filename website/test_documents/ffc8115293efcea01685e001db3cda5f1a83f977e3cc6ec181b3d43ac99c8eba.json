    "Maltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\n• 2023 Renewal Inspection: Corrective Action Plan was recorded during\nthis reporting period as a result of the Renewal Inspection completed\n5/22/2023. The violations were noted for employee personnel files,\nemployee training, and treatment plans. The CAP contained action items\nto ensure documents required for employee files were obtained prior to\nhire by utilizing a checklist to confirm all required documents were\nobtained. The facility implemented a system for human resources to\nemail prompt sheet reminders to supervisors a month prior to evaluations\nbeing completed, it appears this system did not work as there was no\nfollow up from human resources on obtaining the evaluations that were\ndue to be completed. The facility created a prompt sheet reminder for\nwhen treatment plans were due, it appears that the date was calculated\nby month and did not consider one of the months had thirty-one days\nresulting in a treatment plan being overdue by one day. The facilities\nCAP was effective as marked by significant improvement of rule\nviolations found during this interim inspection.\n• SIR2023C0000720SI, CAP approved 10/9/2023 was a result of repeat\nviolations for Rule 400.142(1) (e) due to the facility not reviewing hospital\ndischarge paperwork summary resulting in the facility not obtaining\nmedication and providing the medication to the youth, and Rule 400.4112\n(4) (a) due to staff unprofessionalism and the facility not ensuring the\nhospital safety plan was implemented into the facilities safety plan. The\nfacility implemented a formal discharge protocol to be used when youth\nare discharged from the hospital and the social service worker and on-\ncall supervisor are informed of the instructions on the discharge form.\nProfessionalism training was provided to all staff and has been added to\nthe new hire training.\n• SIR2024SIC0001200, CAP approved 4/3/2024 was a result of repeat\nviolation for Rule 400.4159 (5) due to three restraints not being\nperformed per the facilities restraint model technique and Rule 400.4163\n(5) as the facility had three restraints that were not documented as\nrestraints in MiSACWIS. The facility retrained the staff who was involved\nwith the restraints, discussed restraint to be used with specific youth at\nteam meetings, and has implemented restraint reviews to be completed\n4",
    "by the Handle with Care trainer and/or Chief Administrator to ensure\nproper techniques are being used. The facility restrained all staff on\nrestraint definition per PA 116 and amended the incident reports in\nMiSACWIS to accurately reflect the incidents as restraints.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facilities financial audit was reviewed by Michigan Department of Health &\nHuman Services Bureau of Audit due to concerns noted in past audit findings.\nProgress was noted, but there were repeated findings for the 2022 audit. Corrective\naction will be requested and required to mitigate the finding by the Bureau of Audit.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. Chief Administrator reported\nfindings in Renewal inspection had a positive impact as the CAP assisted in\nensuring compliance for this interim inspection as human resources now utilizes a\nchecklist that is reviewed by both human resources and the training coordinator\nprior to an employee starting preservice training to ensure all required documents\nhave been received.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported feeling supported by management at the facility and well trained.\nStaff like the refresher training opportunities that are available and feel the facility\nmeets all training needs. Staff reported feeling safe and youth being well cared for.\nStaff did not have any concerns. The facility is short staffed currently as this time of\nyear is when several staff complete school and return home for the summer. Staff\nhave been working to fill shifts as well as upper management has been assisting in\nshift coverage to avoid staff burn out. The facility has new staff currently completing\nnew hire training and is looking to start another new hire training in the next few\nweeks.\nYouth interviews were conducted during the inspection. All youth report their needs\nare being met at the facility and no concerns. Youth report feeling safe. Youth did\nindicate not liking some of the food options on the menu and staff have worked to\nchange the menu to have meals the youth prefer.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\n5",
    "An onsite inspection and walk through of the facility occurred on May 14, 2024.\nThe facility was clean and there were no safety concerns. All youth bedrooms were\nviewed to have appropriate bedding, medications and cleaning supplies were\nsecured as required. There was sufficient food in the home.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n5/15/2024\n_____________________________________\nJennifer Pastorick Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 16, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
