    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription • (1) An agency shall require a staff member who has\nongoing contact with children or parents to be a person\nwho has the ability, experience, education, and training to\nperform the duties assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency staff attempted to remove food from youth's mouth to\nprevent choking and left mark on his face.\nInvestigation Foster Care Supportive Visitation worker (FCSV worker) was\ninterviewed via video conference on July 29, 2025, with\nMDHHS worker. She stated she meets with parents to conduct a\n1 hour lesson on nurturing parenting and then observes 1 hour of\nparenting time and steps in if needed. The program is based on\nnurturing parenting skills such as knowing age-appropriate\nbehaviors, emotional development, recognizing child needs,\nappropriate punishment and rewards, etc. She has been working\nwith Parent since April 10, 2025. Holy Cross has case\nmanagement, but she is involved as a contracted service provider.\nFCSV worker stated on July 22, 2025, a meeting/parenting time\noccurred with Parent. Youth A was served peanut butter and jelly\nsandwich on white bread and macaroni and cheese for lunch.\nYouth A was observed to take big bites and she and Case Aide\nreminded him to take smaller bites and ensure it was chewed\nthoroughly. At the end of the visit while putting Youth A in the\nvehicle she noticed Youth A’s mouth was full of some of the\npeanut butter and jelly sandwich that he had not finished chewing\nup and swallowing. She notified Parent who then opened his\nmouth and confirmed this. FCSV worker had him open his mouth\nand was able to get him to spit out a small amount. She then gave\nhim sips of water, but Youth A still had a good amount of the\nsandwich in his mouth. She stated to Parent and Case Aide she\nwas concerned they needed to get this out of his mouth or have\nhim chew and swallow the remaining amount of food since they\nwere concerned he would choke during the 45 minute car ride\nback to the foster home.\nCase Aide and Parent opened the trunk of the Holy Cross car and\nthey sat Youth A down. They were trying to give him sips of a\ndrink and were rubbing his cheeks to encourage him to finish\nchewing the food or have him spit it out. FCSV worker stated from\nwhere she was standing, she wasn’t able to see who was doing\n2",
    "what. After approximately 10 minutes, FCSV worker switched with\nCase Aide, and she was trying to get Youth A to laugh or stick his\ntongue out and a small amount of food came out. She also tried\nrubbing his checks. Parent held his face while FCSV worker did a\nfinger swoop to remove most of the food. There was a small\namount of the sandwich in Youth A’s mouth, but he swallowed\nthat, and they gave him a drink. FCSV worker stated Youth A\nnever showed any signs or made an audible noise showing any\ndiscomfort. She never observed anyone being rough or doing\nanything that would have caused any mark or bruise on Youth A’s\nface. She stated he was squirming a bit but nothing excessive.\nThe overall concern was the long car ride and the risk of Youth A\nchoking on the food in his mouth. FCSV worker stated she didn’t\nnotice any redness or marks on Youth A’s cheeks after the visit.\nShe stated the entire incident took approximately 20 minutes.\nYouth A’s face was not continuously held; the efforts were made\nin short intervals.\nCase Aide was interviewed via telephone on August 8, 2025.\nShe stated she was the Case Aide for Youth A but is no longer\nemployed with Holy Cross. On July 22, 2025, there was a\nsupervised parenting time with Parent and Youth A as well as\nFCSV worker. At the conclusion of the visit, it was noticed Youth A\nhad a lot of food in his mouth and wouldn’t swallow it. There was\nconcern he would choke during the long car ride back to foster\nplacement. Case Aide stated she and Parent sat Youth A on the\ntruck of the vehicle. Parent was trying to get the food out of his\nmouth by massaging his cheeks and giving him sips of water.\nSince it was peanut butter and jelly sandwich it was more difficult\nto get it out of Youth A’s mouth. Youth A was turning his head and\ntrying to slide down the car. Case Aide stated she and Parent tried\nfor about 10 minutes and FCSV worker and Parent also tried for\nan additional 10 minutes. She didn’t notice anything that was\naggressive or inappropriate. The intent was so that he wouldn’t\nchoke. Youth A has a history of pocketing food. The car ride was\nfrom Saginaw to Midland. Alexis didn’t notice any marks or\nredness until they arrived in Midland. When she went to get Youth\nA out of the car seat, she noticed redness and informed Foster\nParent they had attempted to get food out of his mouth.\nFoster Parent (FP) was interviewed via telephone on August\n11, 2025. She stated her biggest concern is she has repeatedly\nverbally told Parent during the 2 years Youth A has been placed in\nher care different techniques to utilize and foods he should and\nshouldn’t be given based on his ability to chew and swallow. She\nclarified when he was initially placed in her care he was being fed\n3",
    "through a GI tube in his stomach. He has participated in feeding\ntherapy. He is now eating food by mouth and had his GI tube\nremoved in January 2025. Youth A needs thinner fluid like foods\nsuch as apple sauce and yogurt to assist with his swallowing. It’s\nalso important that Youth A sits in a highchair so he can focus on\nhis eating. FP stated she has repeatedly told Parent these things\nand is frustrated to know during the incident Youth A was given a\npeanut butter and jelly sandwich and was walking around while\neating. If he’s given the appropriate food and the appropriate time\nfor him to eat, he can eat on his own.\nFP stated upon returning from parenting time on July 22, 2025,\nCase Aide reported to her there was a mark on Youth A’s cheek.\nFP asked what caused the mark and Case Aide reported he had\nfood stuck in his cheek and they didn’t want him in the car for that\nlength of time with that amount of food still in his mouth. FP stated\nshe asked Case Aide what type of food was provided and\nindicated the fact it was peanut butter and jelly was probably what\ncaused it. Case Aide reported she and FCSV worker were taking\nturns pushing on his cheek for approximately 20 minutes to get\nthe food out of his mouth. She was concerned based on the\nredness and bruising on Youth A ‘s face she ended up taking him\nto Urgent Care. She stated the incident happened on Thursday\nand the marks on his face were still visible the following Monday\nor Tuesday.\nParent was interviewed via telephone on August 11, 2025.\nShe stated she had a supervised visit with Youth A. At the end of\nthe visit it was noticed Youth A had a lot of food in his cheek that\nhe wasn’t swallowing. She stated he had eaten peanut butter and\njelly and had pocketed it in his cheek. She stated she was\npreviously advised by Complainant to massage his cheek or give\nhim sips of a drink to encourage him to swallow. She stated she,\nCase Aide and FCSV worker tried those techniques for\napproximately 15 minutes. Youth A would slowly swallow some\nbut still had a large amount of food and Alexis needed to leave to\ntransport him back to the foster placement timely. Eventually Case\nAide grabbed Youth A’s cheeks and FCSV worker put her finger in\nhis mouth and was able to get the food out of Youth A’s mouth.\nParent stated she didn’t feel that she, Case Aide or FCSV worker\nwere rough or aggressive. Youth A never showed any signs of\ndiscomfort. She never noticed any marks on Youth A’s face when\nthey left the visit. His next visit with Parent was the following\nTuesday and there wasn’t a visible mark at that time.\n4",
    "Documents reviewed:\n• Foster Care Supportive Visitation & In-Home Parent\nEducation Weekly Progress Report summary from July 22,\n2025, visit. Report summarized the incident of Youth A\nobtaining a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and pocketing\nin his mouth. The report documents appropriate attempts\nby Parent, Case Aide and FCSV worker as described in all\n3 interviews.\n• Picture of Youth A’s face showing red mark on the left side\nof his face. Mark is consistent with the efforts described in\ninterviews to remove pocketed food. No bruising is visible.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of Youth A’s MISACWIS case file, Case\nAide, FCSV worker and Parent attempted to remove food Youth A\nhad pocketed in his mouth and would not swallow prior to a 45-\nminute commute back to Foster Parent. It was reported there was\nconcern Youth A would choke on the food during the car ride. A\nred mark was later observed on Youth A’s cheek because of\nattempts to remove the food, however it was inadvertent and not\nmalicious in nature.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n__________8/26/2025_________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 26, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n5"
