The report\nwas due 2/25/2025 and was completed 3/03/2025.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The agency was provided technical assistance regarding the timely uploading\nof Parent Agency Treatment Plan (PATP) signature pages. Two PATP's were\ncompleted with signatures on time however there was a delay in uploading\nthem.\n• The agency was informed that DCWL is no longer auditing any DHHS policy.\nAudits will involve the auditing of DCWL rules (Pink Book) only.\n• The agency was also informed that a social work contact documenting that\nthe foster care worker reviewed the PATP with the foster parent and other\nrelevant parities and provided them with a copy of the treatment plan would\nmeet the rule when obtaining signatures was not possible.",
    "V. CONSULTATION\n• Consultation was not requested or required at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency submitted an approved corrective action plan on 9/04/2024 in response to\ntwo violations established during the 6/12/2024 Interim Inspection. The violations\nwere R 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy, and FOM 722-08D Treatment\nPlans. The current Renewal Inspection did not establish any repeat violations\ntherefore indicating the CAP was successful in preventing repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrators Assessment was reviewed. The assessment details the\nagency efforts to achieve CAP compliance. The assessment also addressed\nbarriers to compliance with policy and rules. Barriers included staff turnover as\nwell as document uploading requirements and extra parenting time supervision.\nThe agency currently has a staff vacancy and the licensing worker has had to\nassist with carrying a partial caseload. The assessment also identified the new\nCWLM system as an additional challenge. One disrupted placement was\naddressed and discussed the high mental health needs of the child involved.\nThe assessment was well written and very thorough as it addressed all areas the\ndocument asks for.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency is a local DHHS office. Financial records were not available.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported enjoying working for the agency. They reported that\nsupervision is very supportive of them and easily assessable. Staff further\nreported that they are part of a supportive team and that makes their job easier.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in a modern building in Cheboygan. There is sufficient office\nspace and the facility is well maintained. CHRI documents were observed to be\nsecured as required.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe CPA Analyst identified one safety concern during her visits to the homes and it\nis as follows:\nSafety Alert #1 A safety alert was generated on 5-8-25 as an unlicensed home was\nmissing a smoke alarm between the master bedroom and the rest of the house. A\nsmoke alarm was also missing between the children's bedroom and the rest of the\nhouse.\nResolution: Resolution was achieved on 5-12-2025 as alarms were installed and\nphotos provided.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly 11, 2025\n_____________________________________\nDouglas Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 14, 2025\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
