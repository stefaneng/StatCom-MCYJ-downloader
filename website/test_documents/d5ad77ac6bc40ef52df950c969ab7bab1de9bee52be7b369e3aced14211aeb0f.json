    "I interviewed Youth A on 05/13/2024 at the agency. Youth A is 16\nyears old and has been at the agency for 16 months. Youth A\nadmitted he AWOLed on 04/30/2024 and walked around the\ncampus for about 30 minutes. Youth A said when he returned to\ncampus Supervisor sat with him outside the cottage and tried to\ntalk to him, but Youth A didn’t want to talk. Youth A said he was\nplaying around with Supervisor and tried to take his gloves and\nhat. He said Supervisor put his hand up blocking him from taking\nhis hat and his hand brushed against Youth A’s face. Youth A\ndenied Supervisor hit him in the face or intentionally brushed him\nand he did return to campus. Youth A said he sat outside with\nSupervisor for several hours, but Supervisor did offer him to go to\nthe gym or the office building. He admitted he was agitated and\nchose to stay outside with Supervisor.\nI interviewed Supervisor at the agency on 05/13/2024. Supervisor\nhas been working at the agency for 7 years. Supervisor reported\non 04/30/2024 Youth A had AWOLed and when he returned to\ncampus, he was outside with Youth A. Youth A was agitated and\nrefused to be searched. Youth A has a history of substance abuse\nand being assaultive with staff and his peers. Supervisor sat with\nYouth A outside the cottage and was trying to get him to calm\ndown, he suggested they go to the gym or the administrative\nbuilding, but Youth A refused to go. Supervisor sat outside the\ncottage with Youth A for a couple of hours until he calmed down\nand agreed to be searched. Supervisor said at one point Youth A\nreached over and tried to grab his hat and he put up his hand\ntrying to block Youth A from grabbing his hat. Supervisor’s hand\nbrushed against Youth A’s face. Supervisor denied hitting or\nintentionally touching Youth A’s face. Supervisor said he moved\naway from Youth A after this, but stayed with Youth A outside until\nYouth A calmed down and went back to the cottage.\nI interviewed Staff on 06/04/2024 at the agency on 06/04/2024.\nStaff is a shift leader and was working the evening in question.\nStaff said Youth A refused to be searched and therefore\nSupervisor sat with Youth A outside until Youth A agreed to be\nsearched.

Staff reported all youths must be\nsearched when they return after they AWOL.\nVideo Review:\nVideo footage from 04/30/2024 was reviewed on 05/13/2024\n(Note: video has no audio). Supervisor is observed sitting on the\nbench outside the cottage, Youth A was standing facing\n3",
    "Supervisor. Youth A attempted to grab Supervisor’s cap,\nSupervisor put his hand up blocking Youth A’s hand, Supervisor’s\nhand touched Youth A’s face. Supervisor stood up and moved\naway from Youth A.\nDocumentation Review:\n• Incident report dated 04/30/2024, written by Supervisor.\nIncident report is consistent with Supervisor’s interview.\n• Personnel file for Supervisor: no disciplinary action.\n• Youth A 30-day letter dated 03/08/2024. Over the course of\nthirteen months, Youth A’s behaviors have increased and\nbecome more unstable. Youth A requires constant\nredirection and 1:1 supervision, when on campus. Even\nwith this 1:1 supervision, Youth A continues to engage in\nbehaviors that put himself, his peers, and the staff that is\nworking with him in danger. Youth A’s physical aggression\nhas led to him being placed in a Detention Facility.\nYouth A has been arrested for physically assaulting a staff\nresulting in the staff having to take time off work due to the\ninjuries. Recently Youth A struck another youth so hard in\nthe eye and ear that the youth required multiple visits with\nour campus nurse and urgent care. Youth A regularly\nAWOLs from campus and his school to utilize substances\nand returns combative. He refuses to utilize the\ninterventions created with him in individual therapy and is\nresistant to the multiple interventions that have been\nprovided to him.\n• Agency Search Policy: All residents: can be searched upon\nreturn to campus upon return from AWOL.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted, video footage, and\ndocumentations reviewed, there is insufficient evidence to support\nthe allegations staff hit Youth A. Staff and Youth interviewed\ndenied staff hit youth. Youth A AWOLed on 04/30/2024 and when\nhe returned to campus he refused to be searched, documentation\nand staff interviews confirmed staff followed facility’s policy\nregarding Youth A AWOLing and refusing to be searched.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
