INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12507 Medical/dental and mental health care.\nSection (1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent living\nDescription receives any needed medical, dental, and mental health care as\nrequired in R 400.12413. Medical, dental, and mental health care\nprovided shall be documented in the youth’s record.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The foster care worker has failed to obtain insulin or follow\nthrough with medical care for a diabetic youth.\nInvestigation On 5/16/23 DCWL received an intake stating that Youth A did not\nhave access to insulin, as Foster Care Worker did not fill the\nprescription and provide it to her. Foster Care Worker was\nprovided with two phone numbers to pediatric endocrinologists to\nmake an appointment for Youth A to obtain insulin. Five days after\nthe phone numbers were provided, Complainant spoke with\nFoster Care Worker and determined an appointment had not been\nscheduled. Complainant then spoke with Youth A and spoke with\nher about scheduling an appointment with the endocrinologist.\nYouth A stated she had a prescription, but Foster Care Worker\nhad not picked it up yet.\nDHHS Worker was interviewed by phone on 5/17/23. DHHS\nWorker stated this complaint was filed with DHHS on 5/8/23; their\ninvestigation was complete and without findings. Youth A is\npregnant and diabetic. Youth A currently has the insulin she\nneeds, although she may stay at the hospital until delivery, as it\nwas determined she was not managing her diabetes effectively.\nDHHS Worker indicated the complainant may not have been\naware that Youth A already had her insulin prescription filled, prior\nto making the complaint. DHHS Worker explained there was a mix\nup about a month prior when Youth A was discharged from the\nhospital for another medical issue. Youth A was given\nprescriptions for prenatal vitamins, insulin, a glucose meter, and\ntest strips. Foster Care Worker was unable to take Youth A to pick\nup these items due to an emergency with another youth on her\n2",
    "caseload. Someone else took Youth A to the pharmacy, where the\nvitamins and insulin were filled. However, the pharmacy did not\nhave the glucose meter or strips. The prescriptions were returned\nto Youth A and she was instructed to get the items from a medical\nsupply company. This information was not relayed to Foster Care\nWorker. Therefore, Foster Care Worker was unaware Youth A did\nnot receive these items.\nComplainant was contacted by phone and email on 5/17/23.\nComplainant responded on 5/18/23 and provided identifying\ninformation for Youth A. A follow-up email occurred with\nComplainant on 6/7/23 in which they stated they were aware\nYouth A had insulin. The complainant was concerned Youth A did\nnot have a glucometer. Complainant stated she was aware Youth\nA would be staying in the hospital and her diabetes was under\ncontrol. However, she filed the complaint as she believed she was\nmaking a complaint against Foster Care Worker’s social work\nlicense. It appeared Complainant did not intend to file a complaint\nregarding the agency’s license.\nChief Administrator was contacted by phone and email on\n5/18/23. CA was informed of the investigation and allegation. On\n5/19/23 CA provided contact information for Program Manager,\nFoster Care Supervisor and Foster Care Worker.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed by video\nconference on 5/30/23. FCW reported that until the complaint\ncame in, she was unaware that Youth A was not taking her insulin.\nFCW stated that during monthly visits she would ask Youth A if\nshe needed anything or needed help with managing diabetes.\nYouth A would respond no and indicate she had her medication.\nWhen Youth A found out she was pregnant, her blood work\nshowed elevated sugar levels. Youth A told FCW that she did not\nhave insulin. FCW immediately scheduled an appointment with an\nendocrinologist and obstetrician where she was prescribed\nprenatal vitamins and insulin. FCW believed Youth A was taking\nboth medications from that point on. However, Youth A’s blood\nsugar was very high recently and she was admitted to the\nhospital, where she will remain until the baby is delivered. FCW\nreported that she asked Youth A why she was not taking her\ninsulin as needed and Youth A did not have an explanation. FCW\nstated that Youth A is in independent living and able to fill her own\nprescriptions. FCW reported that after discharge from the hospital,\nthe agency hopes to have Youth A living in a Mommy & Me\nprogram, as it appears she is not able to properly care for herself\nin independent living.\n3",
    "Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) was interviewed by video\nconference on 6/8/23. FCS reported she became aware that\nYouth A was not taking her insulin on the day DHHS began their\ninvestigation. FCS stated that she knew Youth A had insulin, as\nFCW had dropped it off at her apartment two weeks prior to the\ncomplaint. However, Youth A was not administering it. FCS\nreported going to Youth A’s apartment with DHHS on the day their\ninvestigation started. FCS observed multiple bottles of unopened\ninsulin at the apartment. It was unknown why Youth A was not\nusing the insulin. It was noted that the insulin was not stored\nproperly. FCS and DHHS both spent time educating Youth A on\nproper storage and administration. FCS also noticed some unfilled\nprescriptions at Youth A’s house. FCS filled the prescriptions and\ndropped them back off with Youth A that day, ensuring they were\nstored correctly. Regarding the glucometer, Youth A had one\nwhile living with her sister, prior to independent living. It is\nunknown when Youth A lost the device as she did not tell FCS or\nFCW that she needed help getting a new one. FCS spoke with the\nmedical supply company, which stated insurance will only replace\nthe device every five years. Therefore, the agency has ordered\none online and will be paying out of pocket for it. The device will\nbe provided to Youth A when she is discharged from the hospital.\nFCS reported she did not have any concerns about Foster Care\nWorker or her management of this case. FCS stated that Youth A\nhas struggled to do things for herself. Foster Care Worker has\nbeen very supportive and went out to see Youth A every week to\nassist her with obtaining food stamps, managing money, buying\ngroceries, and addressing school absences. Youth A received\ndaily transportation to school but would frequently refuse to go.\nThis information was all documented on a behavior plan in\nMiSACWIS. FCS stated that Youth A also signed a medication\nagreement, to acknowledge that she understood it was her\nresponsibility to manager her insulin. FCS indicated that due to\nYouth A struggling in Independent Living, they are currently\nlooking for a mother/baby program for her.\nYouth A was interviewed via telephone on 6/9/23. Youth A\nreported having her glucometer while living at her sister’s home.\nHowever, it was lost, or left at her sister’s home. Therefore, Youth\nA did not have a glucometer for several months. Youth A reported\nshe did not have difficulty obtaining insulin. But the insulin could\nnot be taken if she did not test her blood sugar with the\nglucometer. Youth A recalled being at the hospital a few months\nago for another health issue. When she was discharged, she\nreceived a prescription for a glucometer, test strips and insulin. An\n4",
    "unknown person, not Foster Care Worker, took her to the\npharmacy and dropped the prescriptions off. When she picked\nthem up, they only had one bottle of insulin in stock and did not\nhave the glucometer, or strips. Youth A received the prescription\npaperwork back from the pharmacy but did not take it anywhere\nelse to be filled. Youth A stated she also did not have needles to\nadminister the insulin. Youth A indicated she was waiting for the\nagency to bring all of these items to her. When asked if she\nrequested these items from Foster Care Worker, Youth A said no.\nYouth A did not identify any barriers to filling the prescriptions\nherself, other than stating she did not want to take public\ntransportation. When asked if she needed more support that\nindependent living offered, Youth A stated no, she did not need\nmore support.\nDocuments reviewed\n• DHHS report dated 6/7/23 indicated no findings.\n• Youth A’s case record was reviewed in MiSACWIS.\nInformation relevant to this investigation is as follows:\no IL placement began on 8/12/22\no Medication agreement 8/16/22. “By signing below,\nyou are agreeing that you understand the statement\nabove and agree to administer the medication to\nyourself, following directions provided by the\nphysician.”\no Emergency Room visit 3/23/23 confirmed\npregnancy. Lab work completed.\no Home visits documented monthly as required. Noted\nYouth A prescribed insulin.\no 3/23/23 Beaumont ER- summary. Positive for\npregnancy, lab work completed. No mention of\ndiabetes concerns.\no Youth A did not attend four medical appointments in\nMarch and April. Youth A did not inform Foster Care\nWorker.\no 5/8/23 home visit noted “Youth was in the hospital\nfor a few hours they gave her ultrasound to see how\nthe baby was doing. Checked her blood levels and\nVitals. Youth was released and was transported\nback home by hospital transportation afterwards.”\no 5/9/23 Safety plan- youth agreed to keep worker\ninformed of all appointments dates/times/locations.\nAgreed to take all prescription medications. Attend\nall medical appointments. Inform worker and\nsupervisor of any issues with appointments.\n5",
    "Transportation by (agency) to all appointments.\nWorker will text (Youth A) at least weekly to see if\nthere are any concerns. (Youth A) will send pic proof\nof attending appointments, attending school, and 3\nmeals a day.\nAnalysis Based on interviews completed and documents reviewed, Youth A\nhad access to insulin. There was insufficient information to\ndetermine when the agency became aware of the youth’s need for\na new glucometer. However, Youth A reported that she previously\nhad one, lost it, and knew she needed one. Youth A stated she\nwould not use public transportation to obtain it. As Youth A is in\nIndependent Living and responsible for her own medication and\nmedical devices, no violation is found.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe agency was advised to document that medication has been\nviewed at every home visit with IL youth. In addition, the agency\nwas advised to document attempts to help youth obtain medical\ndevices if the youth is struggling to obtain it on their own.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_ ______________June 20, 2023_______________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 23, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
