Youth A did\nnot recall what happened previously while in school before he\nwent out to the parking lot. Youth A reported he remembered he\nwas throwing rocks and a staff restrained him. The restraint\nlasted one to two minutes. Youth A was released from the\nrestraint and returned to the school building. Youth A reported he\ndid not have any concerns with the restraint and stated, “there\nwere no marks, scratches, and nothing hurt after.” Youth A\nreported he was restrained for throwing rocks.

Youth A\napproached Staff 7 and began punching Staff 7 in the face three\nto four times and Youth A was placed in a restraint. After Youth A\nwas released from the restraint, Youth A walked willingly out of the\nschool. Staff 1 went outside approximately five minutes after\nYouth A exited the school. Youth A was outside talking with Staff\n2, Staff 3, and Staff 4. Staff 1 noticed the conversation with Youth\nA, Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 was increasingly getting louder and\nStaff 1 heard sounds that he thought were rocks hitting cars. Staff\n1 heard Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 giving Youth A prompts that\nincluded “you don’t need to do that”, and “stop throwing rocks”.\nStaff 1 started to head over to where Youth A was and saw Youth\nA grab a handful of rocks. Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 all initiated\na restraint with Youth A however the restraint was unsuccessful as\nYouth A pulled his arms away.

Staff 1 did not specifically\nrecall but thought Youth A pushed Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 four\nto five times. Staff 1 reported he was also concerned as Youth A\nhad assaulted Staff 3 one to two weeks prior and due to Youth A\ntargeting staff that he feels he can assault, he did not know if\nYouth A would attempt to assault Staff 3 again in this incident.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n3/20/2024. Staff 2 reported Youth A left the school upset and was\n“explosive” and making threats that he was going to throw rocks at\ncar windows and assault staff if he did not get to talk to Supervisor\nwho was not on shift at the time.

    "summary": "The report details two separate incidents where a youth (Youth A) was physically restrained by staff at Eagle Village - Hainley House. The state investigation found both restraints to be unwarranted, as the youth's behavior (throwing rocks, flipping tables, pushing) did not meet the legal threshold of 'severely aggressive behavior' creating a 'serious threat of violence or injury' required for emergency restraint. The facility also failed to submit required incident reports within mandated timeframes. Culpability lies with the facility for improper application of restraint protocols and administrative failures, marking a repeat violation.",
