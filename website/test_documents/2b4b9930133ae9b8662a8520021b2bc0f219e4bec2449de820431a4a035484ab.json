    "Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 14,\n2025. Youth A reported he likes living at the facility and does not\nwant to ever go to another facility. When asked why he liked it\nthere, Youth A reported he gets to go on outings and the staff are\nvery nice. Youth A reported he had a hard day on July 6, 2025.\nWhen asked what happened, Youth A reported he was struggling\nand was not kind to Staff 1. He reported on July 6, 2025, he was\nriding bikes with Staff 2, and they went near the basketball court\non the other side of the facility. He reported he saw Staff 1 and\ntried to joke around with him. Youth A reported he called Staff 1 a\n“bitch” and Staff 1 responded by calling Youth A, a “bitch”. He\nstated this was not in a mean way, it was just them joking around\nbecause he does that with Staff 1. Youth A denied Staff 1 calling\nhim any other inappropriate names or swearing around him. When\nasked about what he said to Therapist and Supervisor, he\nreported he just said those things because he did not want to get\nin trouble. Youth A then went on to talk about how he does not\nwant Staff 1 to get fired and does not want to move from this\nfacility. This consultant reassured Youth A they do not have\nanything to do with Youth A’s placement or Staff 1’s employment.\nConsultant explained to Youth A it is their responsibility to ensure\nYouth A is treated well at the facility, and Youth A confirmed he\nwas being treated well.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 14,\n2025. Staff 1 reported Youth A has a negative history with him. He\nreported last month he picked up a shift on the unit that Youth A\nlives on. Staff 1 reported Youth A became upset because Staff 1\nwas talking with the female staff, and Youth A has a crush on the\nfemale staff. He reported Youth A refused to talk with him at that\ntime. Staff 1 reported one time he saw Youth A walking around\nand told him he had a nice shirt, and Youth A responded by\nstating, “Don’t fucking talk about my shirt, I am fat.” He reported\nhe did not respond to him. Staff 1 reported about three weeks ago,\nhe was working at Youth A’s unit, and Youth A came up to him\nand shoulder-checked him for no reason. He reported he verbally\nredirected Youth A for doing that. Staff 1 reported about a couple\nof weeks later, Youth A was riding his bike with Staff 4. When\nYouth A saw Staff 1, he stuck up his middle finger at him. Staff 1\nreported he told Staff 4 what happened and for her to redirect\nYouth A. He reported on July 6, 2025, that Youth A was outside\nhis unit with Staff 2. Staff 1 reported Youth A had made eye\ncontact with him across the facility because Staff 1 was at the\nbasketball court with Youth C. He reported Youth A rode his bike\nup to Staff 1 with Staff 2 following behind him. Youth A came up to\n3",
    "Staff 1 and told him he was a “bitch ass nigga.” Staff 1 reported he\ntold Youth A, “I am not a bitch ass nigga, and you cannot say that\nto me.” He reported Youth A then got more escalated and\nattempted to do property damage and assault other staff. Staff 1\nreported he did step away and tried to apologize to Youth A for\nmaking him upset. When asked why he used the words “bitch ass\nnigga” to Youth A, he reported Youth A has autism and he needs\nto be told directly what he cannot say. This consultant asked Staff\n1 if he was trained to have this response, and he stated no, he\nwas not. Staff 1 reported he worked with Youth A at his unit but\nwas never trained to work with them specifically. He reported he is\nunaware of any safety plans for the youth at that program or how\nthe program is run. Staff 1 reported he does not understand why\nthe youth in that program do not receive consequences like the\nyouth at the other programs at parts of the overall facility. He\nreported he never called Youth A “bitch ass nigga” or any other\nnames mentioned in the allegations. Staff 1 reported he only said\nthose words to redirect Youth A to make sure he knows he cannot\nsay those things. Staff 1 denied ever reporting the negative\ninteractions he had with Youth A before this incident to any\nleadership team members or Youth A’s therapist.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 14,\n2025. Staff 2 reported on July 6, 2025, she was supervising Youth\nA outside. She reported during that time, Youth A was in a good\nhead space, so she chose to take him for a bike ride around the\nfacility. Staff 2 reported Youth A and she rode their bikes near\nStaff 1, who was playing basketball. She reported Youth A rode\ntowards Staff 1 and called him “pussy ass bitch”. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 attempted to redirect him, and she reported she heard Staff\n1 repeat “pussy ass bitch” back to Youth A. She reported that from\nwhat she heard, it was Staff 1 who was clarifying what Youth A\nhad called him and not him calling Youth A those names. Staff 2\nreported she does not remember what happened afterwards\nbecause she was focused on keeping Youth A calm. She reported\nYouth A became increasingly aggressive and physically\naggressive towards others. Staff 2 reported when Youth A was still\nescalating, Staff 1 did say he was sorry to Youth A for making him\nupset. She does not remember exactly what Staff 1 said in his\napology, as she was trying to redirect Youth A from throwing rocks\nat the parked cars. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 should have stepped\naway from the situation with Youth A earlier and should not have\nrepeated the swear words back at Youth A.\n4",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 14,\n2025. Staff 3 reported on July 6, 2025, he was out playing\nbasketball with Youth B. He reported Staff 1 was also out on the\nbasketball court with Youth C playing basketball. Staff 3 reported\nwhen Youth A rode on his bike towards Staff 1, he was sitting on\nthe bench, and Staff 1 was playing basketball. He reported he\nheard Youth A say something to Staff 1 when he approached but\ndoes not remember exactly what Youth A said or what Staff 1’s\nresponse was. Staff 3 reported he does remember Staff 2 trying to\nverbally de-escalate Youth A. He reported Youth A ran over to\nwhere the employee cars are parked and started to throw rocks.\nYouth A then became physically aggressive towards staff, and\nStaff 3 assisted Staff 1 and Staff 2 with restraint. Staff 3 reported\nhe never heard Staff 1 or any other staff at the facility call Youth A\nor any other youth an inappropriate name or swear in front of\nthem. When asked if the situation could have been handled\ndifferently, Staff 3 reported Staff 1 and Youth A could have been\nseparated more quickly but noted everyone involved did the best\nthey could. He does not remember hearing any inappropriate\nlanguage being said.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 14,\n2025. Staff 4 reported on July 6, 2025, she was outside near the\nbasketball courts. She reported she saw Youth A ride his bike\ntowards the basketball court and stopped to talk with Staff 1. Staff\n4 reported Youth A told Staff 1 he is a “bitch ass nigga.” She\nreported Staff 1 responded by asking Youth A if he indeed called\nhim a “bitch ass nigga” which Youth A then began to escalate in\nbehaviors. Staff 4 reported she does not remember what else was\nsaid after this because she was trying to verbally de-escalate\nYouth A with Staff 2. She reported Staff 1 should never have\nrepeated what Youth A said and should have walked away from\nthe situation. Staff 4 reported Youth A continued to get escalated\nand went toward the car to throw rocks at it. She reported Youth A\nthen became physically aggressive towards her and Staff 2, which\nled to Youth A being restrained due to his physical aggression\ntowards staff. Staff 4 reported when they were by the parked cars,\nStaff 1 was standing away, apologizing to Youth A, stating he was\nsorry for making him upset and was trying to calm him down. She\nreported Youth A does not get along with Staff 1 because he is a\nmale staff member. Staff 4 reported one day she was riding bikes\nwith Youth A around campus, and they saw Staff 1. She reported\nshe had to verbally redirect Youth A because he was giving Staff 1\nthe middle finger for no reason.\n5",
    "Youth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 14,\n2025. Youth B reported on July 6, 2025, he was playing basketball\nwith Staff 1 and Staff 3. He reported Youth A came riding on his\nbicycle toward the court and started “talking crazy” to Staff 1.\nWhen asked to explain “talking crazy”, Youth B reported Youth A\nwas calling Staff 1 a bunch of inappropriate names but could not\nremember exactly what was said. He reported it appeared to him\nthat Staff 1 and Youth A were joking around. Youth B denied ever\nhearing Staff 1 swear or call Youth A any names. He reported he\nhas never heard any staff at the facility call a youth an\ninappropriate name or swear at them.\nYouth C was attempted to be interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on July 14, 2025, but was deemed AWOL from his\nhome visit.\nDocuments Received\n- Email from Foster Care Worker dated 07/09/2025- Foster\nCare Worker is Youth A’s assigned worker and was\ninformed of these allegations. She reported Youth A has\nhad many issues at the facility including assaults, cursing,\nsexually driven comments towards staff and concerns of\nAWOL. Foster Care Worker reported Youth A has some\nstories that have been proven false and even with proof,\nYouth A will always stick to his story.\n- Human Resource File for Staff 1- Staff 1 is employed for\nthe overall Wedgwood Organization but is specifically\nassigned to East Campus License. He has one disciplinary\naction noted in his HR file. Staff 1 was provided a last\nchance agreement form on 01/29/2025 due to being heard\nsaying “f—k you” to a female youth at the facility when that\nyouth was behaviorally escalated. Staff 1 took responsibility\nfor this incident and completed additional training and\ncoaching from supervision. Staff 1 has all required trainings\nto work at the facility but does not have any specific training\nto note to work under West Campus license to have the\nunderstanding of the program. Staff 1 did complete the\nfacility’s general residential training in April 2024 which\nreviews the policies of appropriate communication with the\nyouth.\n- Facility Employee Handbook- The handbook notes,\n“Each client must be recognized and treated as a unique\n6",
    "individual created by God. Employees’ interactions with\npersons served must: reflect the client needs, choices,\npreferences, and individuality; meet the highest\nprofessional, ethical, and legal standards.” The handbook\ngoes on to state, “Employee’s responses/involvement with\na client should always reflect what is therapeutic and\nappropriate. In general: Every client must be treated with\ndignity and respect.”\nAnalysis The facility was found in violation as Staff 1 was not following the\nemployee handbook that notes all staff that are employed at\nWedgwood must treat every client with dignity and respect and all\ninteractions with persons served must meet the highest\nprofessional, ethical, and legal standards. Even if Staff 1 was\nrepeating back the inappropriate name back to Youth A that is still\nnot a professional response to have back to a youth.\nTechnical Assistance:\nTechnical assistance was offered to make sure staff are crossed\ntrained within the different license programs at Wedgwood if they\nare to pick up a shift. This should be documented within that\nstaff’s training record they were trained to work within the specific\nlicense.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR 2024C0001001SI dated 01/17/24 CAP approved 01/24/24\nSIR 2024C0001102SI dated 03/05/24 CAP approved 03/14/24\nSIR 2024SIC0001499 dated 08/06/24 CAP approved 08/23/24\n7",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nAugust 4, 2025\n______________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 7, 2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n8"
