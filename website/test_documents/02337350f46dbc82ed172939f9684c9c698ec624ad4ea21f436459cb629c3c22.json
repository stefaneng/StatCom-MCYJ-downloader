INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Program statement\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth has multiple incidents of self-harm and reports having cuts\nfrom their shoulder to wrist. Youth reports that staff have been\ninformed and have not responded nor sought treatment.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant was interviewed on May 29, 2024, and reported\nthey had no additional information.\nYouth was interviewed face-to-face at the hospital on May 30,\n2024, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Youth said she\nhas been in the hospital for two days and prior to that was placed\nat Osceola Youth Center Shelter program. Youth said her DHHS\nworker “stressed her out” because she was told she was going to\nVista Maria. Youth said she did not want to, and DHHS worker told\nher she would “force” her to go. Youth said her DHHS worker then\nwent on vacation, was not around for her to talk with, and\nsomeone she did not know was supposed to transport her to Vista\nMaria which made her more upset. Youth said this made her feel\nsuicidal so she talked to Nurse who allowed her to call and talk to\nClinical Director. Youth said she told Clinical Director she was\nfeeling suicidal and “did not have the capacity to live” and that she\nwas feeling very unsafe. Supervisor brought her to the hospital for\nan evaluation. Youth said wrote two notes, one listing the reasons\nto live and one the reasons not to live however she ripped both\nthe notes up and threw them away. Youth denied self-harming the\nday she was sent to the hospital. Youth said she felt the staff at\nthe facility and Clinical Director are taking her mental health\nseriously. Youth said she was supposed to be transported to Vista\nMaria today but now cannot go due to being in the hospital. Youth\nsaid she called Clinical Director and said she is now feeling better\nand would like to return to Osceola Youth Center Shelter program\nbut was told that she had to remain in the hospital until assessed.\nYouth said she had cut one other time while at Osceola Youth\nCenter, which was “a few weeks ago”. Youth said at that time she\n2",
    "had received another upsetting phone call from her DHHS worker\nabout placement at Vista Maria and it “stressed her out” so she cut\nseveral superficial marks into her arm and wrote “FAT” into her\narm. Youth said she was stressed due to needing “a new\nwardrobe” prior to going to Vista Maria however not having had\ntime to go shopping since being placed at Osceola Youth Center.\nYouth said she had a small piece of glass she found in the gravel\nparking lot at the facility. Youth said another youth had broken out\na van window and despite the staff trying to get all the glass\ncleaned up she still found a piece. Youth said cutting was her\n“coping skill” and not done out of suicidal feelings. Youth said as\nsoon as she cut, she talked to Staff 1 who called and had her talk\nto Assistant Facility Administrator briefly, and then she saw Nurse\nwho cleaned her up and placed in on 5-minute observation. Youth\nsaid she meet with Clinical Director the following morning and she\nwas removed from 5-minute observation. Youth said she meets\nwith Clinical Director about “six times a week” and feels all the\nstaff take her seriously whenever she is saying she is having an\nissue. Youth said all staff will complete the 5-minutes checks when\nshe is on that status and they will come into her room and ensure\nshe does not have anything unsafe, make her “shake out” her\nclothing, and if under her covers in her room make her show staff\nshe is not harming herself.\nClinical Director was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nMay 30, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Clinical\nDirector said Youth was previously placed at Osceola Youth\nCenter Shelter program however ended up leaving due to laying in\nthe road attempting to be hit by a vehicle and being sent to\ninpatient hospitalization. Clinical Director said when Youth\nreturned to Osceola Youth Center, she immediately was placed on\n5-minute observation due to arriving in the evening hours and not\nbeing able to assess her current emotional state at that time.\nClinical Director said she completed a risk assessment the\nfollowing day and removed the heightened supervision due to the\nresults of Youth’s assessment as well as information provided by\nher prior placement that she had not self-harmed in seven\nmonths. Clinical Director said she also visually inspected Youth’s\narms during the initial meeting as that was where she would\nnormally cut herself and she had no new cuts. Clinical Director\nsaid Youth did well for a little over a week, she had been\nparticipating in outings and did not have any self-harm behaviors.\nClinical Director said on May 21, 2024, she received a call\nregarding Youth self-harming by cutting her arm. Clinical Director\nsaid she talked to Youth over the phone who reported it was a\ncoping mechanism and she reported no suicidal ideations or plans\n3",
    "to commit suicide, therefore Clinical Director said she placed her\non 5-minute observation checks. Clinical Director said when she\ncame into work on May 22, 2024, she completed a risk\nassessment with Youth and viewed her cuts. Clinical Director said\nYouth’s cuts were superficial in nature and she did not have an\nelevated score for suicidal ideations or a plan to commit suicide\nand therefore she was removed from 5-minute observation at that\ntime. Clinical Director said Youth had become very attached to\nanother youth at the facility and that youth did not reciprocate the\nsame feelings which resulted in Youth’s emotional instability and\nself-harming behavior. Clinical Director said on the evening of May\n28, 2024, she received a phone call from Supervisor who reported\nYouth was making suicidal statements and reported having 47\nways to commit suicide. Clinical Director said she talked to Youth\nover the telephone who disclosed she had a plan to lay in the road\nand get hit by a vehicle and no safety plan would prevent her from\ndoing so, therefore Clinical Director had her brought to the\nemergency room for further evaluation.\nNurse was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 4,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Nurse said a few\nweeks ago Youth had an ace wrap around her arm, so she asked\nher what had happened, and Youth showed her she had cut her\narm. Nurse said Youth’s cuts were superficial vertical lines and a\npeer’s name scratched into her left arm. Nurse said she cleaned\nYouth’s arm, disinfected it, put Neosporin on it and covered it with\na clean bandage. Nurse said Youth reported the ace wrap was\nsomething she had in her room and was a personal belonging.\nNurse said Youth reported she cut with a small piece of glass she\nfound after another youth had broken a van window in the gravel\nparking lot. Nurse said staff had attempted to clean all the glass\nup however must have missed some. Nurse said Staff 1 was on\nthe unit with Youth that evening. Nurse said Youth talked to\nClinical Director who placed her on 5-minute observation. Nurse\nsaid she informed staff and started the observation log. Nurse said\nshe did not know how long Youth was on 5-minute checks or if\nClinical Director assessed her the following day as Nurse said she\nwas not working. Nurse said a few days ago when she was\nworking, Supervisor came into her office and told her Youth\nreported she has forty-five ways to commit suicide. Nurse said she\nwent to the Shelter to check on Youth and while there had her call\nand talk to Clinical Director. Nurse said Youth reported to Clinical\nDirector she would lay in the middle of the road if left at the facility\novernight and so Clinical Director told Nurse to bring her to the\nhospital for an evaluation. Nurse said she brought Youth to the\nhospital and sat with her until the following morning. Nurse said\n4",
    "Clinical Director is always available to talk with the staff or youth\nand always takes the youth seriously when they report any\nconcerns.\nSupervisor was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\nJune 4, 2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Supervisor\nsaid he was not working the evening Youth cut herself a few\nweeks ago however was working on May 28, 2024, when Youth\nwas sent to the hospital. Supervisor said Youth was on an outing\nwith Staff 2 when she reported she wanted too “unalive” herself.\nSupervisor said Staff 2 had reported this to him when they came\nback from the outing so he went and talked to Nurse regarding\nwhat had been said. Supervisor said Nurse went to the Shelter\nunit and talked to Youth and had her call Clinical Director.\nSupervisor said after the phone call Youth was brought to the\nhospital by Nurse for an assessment. Supervisor said he believed\nYouth had additional fresh cuts on her arm the night she went to\nthe hospital. Supervisor said Youth had reported to Clinical\nDirector she was going to lay in the road if left at the facility.\nSupervisor said he has no concerns about staff response to self-\nharm or suicidal ideations. Supervisor said all staff take youth\nseriously when they report any emotional concerns.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 4,\n2024, in collaboration with the MDHHS worker. Staff 1 said he\nwas working on the detention the night Youth cut her arms. Staff 1\nsaid he went outside and saw Youth with Staff 2 and noticed\nYouth’s arms were wrapped in a bandage. Staff 1 said he asked\nYouth what had happened, and she reported she cut her arms.\nStaff 1 said Youth did not provide any additional details on the\ncutting and he did not see it occur. Staff 1 said he was made\naware Youth had gone to the hospital on May 28, 2024, however\nhe was not working that evening and did not have anything to do\nwith that situation. Staff 1 said when a youth harms themselves\nstaff are supposed to intervene and stop them immediately, tend\nto the wound, and tell supervisor. Staff 1 said the supervisor on\nshift will then make the additional calls and direct staff what they\nare supposed to do. Staff 1 said he has not had concerns that\nstaff ignore or do not follow protocol when youth self-harm.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on June 4,\n2024, in collaboration with MDHHS worker. Staff 2 said she was\nworking on both May 21, 2024, when Youth cut her arms, and May\n28, 2024, when Youth had suicidal statements. Staff 2 said on May\n21, 2024, Youth came out of the shower with a wrap on her arm.\nStaff 2 said she asked Youth why she had on the wrap and Youth\n5",
    "did not answer. Staff 2 said Nurse arrived at the facility the same\ntime she was asking Youth about the wrap, and Youth walked over\nto Nurse and told her she had cut her arms. Staff 2 said Nurse\ntook her to her office and took care of Youth’s arm and then\nbrought her back to the unit a little while later and said Youth was\non 5-minute observation. Staff 2 said she completed the 5-minute\nobservation for the duration of her shift however then did not work\nagain for five days and when she returned to work Youth was no\nlonger on 5-minute observation. Staff 2 said on May 28, 2024, she\nbrought the Shelter youth on an outing to a park. Staff 2 said\nYouth did not want to go at first but once at the park Youth sat and\ntalked to Staff 2 about “so many things” including her past, family,\nand next placement. Staff 2 said Youth told her she wanted to kill\nherself and had a plan on how to die. Staff 2 said Youth talked\nabout wanting to go to the hospital and get an evaluation due to\nhow she was feeling. Staff 2 said she returned to the agency and\nwent and told Supervisor who then told Nurse who came and got\nYouth and took her to the hospital. Staff 2 said whenever a youth\ntalks about suicide or has any self-harm, she immediately tells the\nsupervisor on shift, and they take over and make any additional\ndecisions and calls.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth’s Corewell Health Hospital documents dated May 28,\n2024, were reviewed.
