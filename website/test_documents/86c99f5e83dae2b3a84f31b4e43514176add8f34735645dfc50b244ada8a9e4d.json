    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4150 Incident reporting.\nSection (1) Any incident resulting in serious injury of a resident or\nDescription illness requiring inpatient hospitalization, shall be reported to\nthe parent/ legal guardian, responsible referring agency, and\nthe licensing authority as soon as possible, but not more than\n24 hours after the incident.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On or around 12/09/23 or 12/10/23, Youth A was stabbed in the\nleft forearm with a pencil by another youth while trying to break up\na fight. Youth A has bruising on the left forearm and was treated\nby a nurse at the facility. The facility did not notify Youth A’s foster\ncare worker, probation office, or parents of the incident.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n12/18/2023.\nInterviews:\nI contacted complainant on 12/18/2023, no additional information\nwas provided.\nI spoke with Youth A’s Foster Care Worker on 12/18/2023. She\nreported Youth A has been at the facility for five months and\nusually she is notified of incidents involving Youth A, but she was\nnot notified of this incident.\nI interviewed Clinical Manager on 12/19/2023 at the facility.\nClinical Manager reported there was a physical altercation\ninvolving three youths, Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D, on\n12/12/2023. Youth A was not directly involved but she tried to\nbreak up the fight. She said Youth A reported after the fight she\ngot poked with a pencil. Youth A was seen by the nurse and the\nnurse removed a small piece of lead from her lower arm. Clinical\nManager reported the supervisors would have notified the parents,\nguardians, and workers of an incident involving a youth requiring\nmedical care for a serious injury. Youth A was not directly involved\nin this incident and did not sustain a serious injury.\nI interviewed Youth A on 12/19/2023 at the facility. Youth A has\nbeen at the facility since August 2023. She reported last week\nthere was a fight between three youths, Youth B, Youth C, and\nYouth D, on the Pod. She said Staff 1, Staff 2 and Supervisor 1\nwere on the pod. Staff 1 initially tried to talk to the youths, but the\n2",
    "youths kept arguing and they attacked each other. She said Staff\n1 immediately tried to separate the girls and she also intervened\ntrying to help the staff. Youth A thinks Youth B stabbed her with a\npencil and that’s how she got the lead in her arm. Youth A was\nexamined by the nurse, who removed the piece of lead from the\narm. Youth A reported feeling safe and did not express any\nconcerns regarding the staff or the facility.\nI interviewed Youth B on 12/19/2023 at the facility. Youth B has\nbeen at the facility for three months. She recalled getting into a\nfight with Youth C and Youth D on 12/12/23. She said Youth A\nwas not involved in the fight. She denied having a pencil or\nstabbing anyone with a pencil during the fight. She said Staff 1\nand Staff 2 immediately intervened and separated her and Youth\nC. Youth B denied getting hurt or needing medical care.\nI interviewed Youth C on 12/19/2023 at the facility. Youth C has\nbeen at the facility for one month. She recalled she and Youth B\nwere involved in a fight on 12/12/23. She said Staff 1, Staff 2 and\nSupervisor 1 were on the Pod. Youth C said staff immediately\ncalled security and stopped the fight. She does not recall Youth A\nintervening in the fight. She denied having a pencil during the fight\nand did not witness Youth A getting stabbed with a pencil.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 on 12/21/23 at the facility. Supervisor\n1 reported she was on the pod with the staff during the incident on\n12/12/2023. She said Youth A was not involved in the fight and\nwhen she tried to intervene, she was redirected away. She said\nafter the fight Youth A reported she got struck with a pencil, so\nsupervisor 2 took Youth A to be examined by the nurse.\nSupervisor 1 said they searched the pod and the bedrooms after\nthe incident and did not find a pencil. Supervisor 1 thinks Youth A\nmay have poked herself with the pencil during school, because\nthat is the only time the youths have access to pencils. Supervisor\n1 said Youth A did not have a serious injury and that is the reason\nthe foster care worker was not notified. The facility’s policy is the\nsupervisor would immediately notify the parent, guardian, and\nworker when a youth has a serious injury that requires medical\nattention.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 12/21/2023 at the facility. Staff 1 reported\non 12/12/2023 a fight broke out between Youth B , Youth C and\nYouth D; staff called for security and immediately separated the\ntwo youths. Youth A did attempt to intervene, but she was\nredirected away from the other youths. Youth A reported after the\nfight, that she got stabbed with a pencil. She denied Youth B had\na pencil and did not witness anyone stab or strike Youth A. She\nsaid the pod and rooms were searched and there was no pencil\n3",
    "found. Youth A was examined by the nurse, and she did have a\nsmall piece of lead in her lower arm. The nurse removed the lead,\ncleaned the area, and put a band-aide on her arm.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 on 01/10/2024 at the facility.\nSupervisor 2 has been working at the facility for one year.\nSupervisor 2 reported she was called to the Pod on 12/12/2023\nwhen the fight broke out. Supervisor 2 didn’t witness the fight,\nbecause when she arrived on the Pod, staff had already\nseparated the youths. Supervisor 2 said Youth A was upset and\nreported that she got stabbed with a pencil during the fight. She\ntook Youth A to see the nurse and the nurse removed the lead\nfrom her arm. Supervisor 2 reported the facility’s policy is that the\nsupervisor notifies the parents, guardians, and workers of an\nincident involving a youth requiring medical care for a serious\ninjury. Youth A was not directly involved in the fight and did not\nsustain a serious injury, therefore it was not required that the\nworker be notified of the incident.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 12/12/2023, written by Supervisor 1,\nYouth B and Youth C engaged in a verbal dispute. Staff 1\nand staff 2 attempted to verbally de-escalate the situation\nbut was unsuccessful. Youth C struck Youth B in the face,\nYouth B punched Youth C, Staff 1 and Staff 2 intervened\nand separated the Youths. Youth B and Youth C were not\ninjured.\n• Medical assessment for Youth A dated 12/12/2023,\ncompleted by Nurse. Youth A was seen in the clinic after\nbeing poked with a pencil during the incident on the pod.\nNurse removed a pointed edge with tweezers from Youth\nA’s left arm.\n• Facility’s Critical Incident Policy. This policy outlines the\ncriteria and requirements for staff to complete an unusual\nincident report and a critical incident report. Critical\nIncidents are of the following: allegations of abuse and/or\nneglect, incident requiring police involvement, incident\nrequiring medical attention from an outside provider, death,\nsuicide attempts, and youth escapes.\n4",
    "Analysis Based on interviews conducted and documents reviewed, no\nviolation is found. The staff responded appropriately in their\napproaches to keep all youth safe during the fight. Youth A was\nseen by the nurse, and a medical assessment was completed.\nYouth A was not directly involved in the fight and did not sustain a\nserious injury; therefore, it was not required that the worker be\nnotified of the incident involving Youth A.\nTechnical Assistance\nIf a youth becomes involved in a situation to help protect another\nyouth, staff need to instruct youth to back away and not get\ninvolved for their own safety.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJanuary 26, 2024\n_________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n02/06/2024\n_________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
