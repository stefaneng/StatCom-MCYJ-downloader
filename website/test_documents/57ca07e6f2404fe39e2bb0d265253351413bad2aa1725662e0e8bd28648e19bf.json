    "Chief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. The CA indicated the agency\nwas in compliance for the previous year's audit, therefore a Corrective Action Plan\nwas not required. The agency holds monthly supervisor quality team meetings to\nreview data and create solutions to address any barriers. The assessment noted\nlimited dental providers as well as delays with immigration attorneys on new\ncases. In addition, recent staff resignations have created a staff shortage. The\nChief Administrator expressed confidence with continued compliance over the\nupcoming review period.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors and coworkers are available to assist as\nneeded. Staff did not report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and independent living services. All files were\nstored securely and there is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThis agency is not contracted with MDHHS to provide foster care placement or\ncertification services; therefore this is not applicable.\n3",
