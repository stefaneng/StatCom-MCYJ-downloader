    "Investigation I reviewed intake dated 12/20/2022. It states Youth A assaulted Staff\nPerson 1during the weekend of 12/16/2022 because Staff Person 1\nallegedly threatened to kill Youth A and because Staff Person 1 pushed\nYouth A. Youth A had no injuries.\nI review incident report dated 12/18/2022. It states Youth A left the tv\nlounge with the purpose to AWOL and that Staff Person 1 attempted to\nverbally redirect him back. Staff Person 1 stood in front of the parking\nlot door as Youth A repeatedly stated that he was going to kill Staff\nPerson 1 and that Youth A spit in the direction of Staff Person 1 at\nwhich point he moved front in front of the door. Youth A then ran up to\nStaff Person 1 and began punching him as he stood in a protective\nstance. Staff Person 1 fell to the floor at which point Youth A was\nscratched and that other staff and residents got Youth A off of Staff\nPerson 1. Notation indicates Youth A wanted to AWOL to smoke.\nPolice were contacted and an assault complaint was filed by Staff\nPerson 1.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite on 12/20/2022 with DHHS Worker. He\nreports placing a shoe in the stairway door so he could leave the facility\nto go smoke and return later. He reports Staff Person 1 took the shoe\nfrom the door, stood in the hallway, and that Youth A spit in the\ndirection of Staff Person 1, but not on him. He reports Staff Person 1\nsaid, “If you spit on me, I’m going to kill you” and then pushed Youth A.\nYouth A states that is when he started punching Staff Person 1 and that\nStaff Person 1 was punching back. Youth A then indicates that he\npushed Staff Person 1 to the floor and that he continued to attempt to\nhit Staff Person 1. Youth A reports Staff Person 2 and other residents\ncame over and pulled Youth A off of Staff Person 1. Youth A states no\none initially saw what had transpired between he and Staff Person 1.\nYouth A states he does not know how he got the scratch to the side of\nhis neck, stating it could have occurred from Staff Person 1 or when\nothers were pulling him off of Staff Person 1.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 via telephone on 01/19/2023. He reports\nterminating his employment with the facility for reasons not related to\nthis investigation. He was employed by the facility for five months and\nreceived behavior management training. He reports standing in the\ndoorway by the parking lot when Youth A was attempting to AWOL\nfrom the building. He recalls Youth A say that he was going to kill Staff\nPerson 1 and began spitting at him. Staff Person 1 states Youth A\nstarted to charge at him and that he placed himself in a protective\nstance. Youth A swung at Staff Person 1 with his casted arm and kept\npunching at him when he tripped on his shoelaces causing him to fall to\nthe ground. Staff Person 1 states he held up his left hand, blocking\nYouth A’s swings with his cast, and notes Staff Person 2 and other\n4",
    "residents pulled Youth A off him. Staff Person 1 denies telling Youth A\nthat he will kill Youth A and states that is what Youth A kept telling him.\nStaff Person 1 also denies punching at Youth A and states that Youth A\npushed and started punching him causing him to fall to the floor and got\non top of him and continued to hit him with his cast. Staff Person 1\nstates he contacted the police and filed a report.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 onsite on 01/10/2023 with DHHS Worker.\nShe reports being employed by the facility for one year and up to date\non her behavior management training. She reports entering the\nhallway with an unknown number of residents to see Youth A on top of\nStaff Person 1 swinging at him. She states that she, Staff Person 3,\nand some of the residents pulled Youth A off Staff Person 1. She did\nnot observe how Youth A got to be on top of Staff Person 1, though\nheard that Youth A propped the door to AWOL, and that he spit at and\nstarted to hit Staff Person 1 in the process.\nI interviewed Youths B and C onsite on 01/10/2023 with DHHS Worker.\nThey do not report having any problems with Staff Person 1 or with the\nfacility.\nThere is no video surveillance to review.\nAnalysis There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Staff Person 1\nthreatened to kill Youth A or push him as Youth A alleges. Youth A was\nplanning to AWOL from the facility and propped the door for his return\nwhen Staff Person 1 intervened. Youth A then spit at and pushed Staff\nPerson 1 causing him to fall and began punching him with Youth A's\ncast before being pulled off by staff and other residents.\nConsultation: Staff are not to permit or encourage residents to restrain other\nresidents.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract and policy.\nIt is recommended that the current license status be continued.\n4",
