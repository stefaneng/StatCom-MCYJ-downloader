Case service plan approval process\nrequires the foster care supervisor to review and approve the USP\nwithin 14 calendar days of the report date.\nOne of three foster care cases (one of eleven USPs) was not approved within the\nrequired timeframe. The 8/26/20 USP was not approved until 10/1/20.\nREPEAT VIOLATION:\nRenewal dated 8/12/19, 1st provisional recommendation, CAP approved 10/24/19.\nFOM 722-08E Foster Care Juvenile Justice Action Summary\nThe caseworker must complete the DHS-69, Foster Care/Juvenile\nJustice Action Summary, and upload to MiSACWIS within the\ntimeframe required for the specified action/change:\nPage 3- Prior to a planned placement change, or within three\nbusiness days of an emergency placement change, the\ncaseworker must document…\nPage 6- Within three business days of foster care and/or juvenile\njustice program/case closure, the caseworker must document…\nOne of three open cases and three of three closed cases were missing a DHHS-69.\nFile One (open): A DHHS-69 was not completed for a move on 2/5/20.\nFile Two (closed): A DHHS-69 was not completed at case closure.\nFile Three (closed): A DHHS-69 was not completed at case closure.\nFile Four (closed): A DHHS-69 was completed at case closure. However, it was not\ncompleted within the required timeframe.\nREPEAT VIOLATION:\nRenewal dated 8/12/19, 1st provisional recommendation, CAP approved 10/24/19.\n7",
    "IV. ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns were identified by the DCWL analyst.\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area:\nOne foster home file held a special evaluation (SE) that was initiated concurrently\nwith the child moving from the home. At the conclusion of the SE the agency did not\nprovide a copy of the report to the foster care worker for that child, as he was no\nlonger in the home. The rule states at the conclusion of the SE the agency is\nrequired to provide a copy to any worker that “has children placed in the home”. The\nagency was advised that best practice would be to provide the report to the worker\nof the child that moved, as the child was in the home at the time of the allegation,\nand the allegation was specifically about that child.\nVI. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP was approved on 10/24/19 as a result of the renewal evaluation in which a 1st\nProvisional license was recommended. A second CAP was approved on 2/25/20 as\na result of the renewal evaluation in which a regular license was recommended.\nDuring the current review, the agency was determined to have demonstrated\nsignificant improvement in several areas. In 2019 there were 48 violations cited; in\n2020 there were 13 violations cited; in the current review there were 10 violations\ncited. In addition, the occurrence of violations has also decreased. Most violations\nfrom this current review were found in only one of three files reviewed. Over the past\nyear, the agency has hired additional staff, and implemented new procedures and\ntracking mechanisms. These steps appear to be working. However, it is noted that\nthe agency still has some work to do regarding action summaries, medical\npassports, and PATP signatures.\n8",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\nJanuary 28, 2021\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 1, 2021\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9"
