She reported the leadership team is working with the supervisors to\nencourage and support the staff and teach the staff how to connect with one\nanother and create an environment that is supportive and helpful to carry out their\nrespective duties. The CA reported that managing the work of child welfare has\nbecome increasingly difficult, not because the work is impossible, but because the\nmanner in which they have managed the work must change. She said the agency",
    "is doing whatever they can to ensure the success of the staff which in turn ensures\nthe success of the cases that staff are managing.
