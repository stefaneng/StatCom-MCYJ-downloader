He was told it was not due to the special\ninvestigation that’s occurring related to his license.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 8/2/2021 I reviewed the complaint document, which was a letter documented\nfrom Attorney M, as Foster Parent A’s attorney. The letter was addressed to\nLicensing Supervisor B, and Licensing Worker E of the Wayne County Department\nof Health and Human Services (DHHS) North Central (NC), and the Division of Child\nWelfare Licensing (DCWL). The letter indicated the following:\n Foster Parent A is seeking information concerning the status of his license\nafter a placement interruption without notice on Thursday, 7/29/2021.\n “Upon information and belief Foster Parent A was verbally informed that a\nRule 400.9207 Special Evaluation, effective 7/8/2021 has been initiated\nagainst him. However, he has not received a description of the allegations in\nwriting or a date and time for his interview. “\n He also emailed a complaint on 7/29/2021, however, no one has\nacknowledged receipt of his concern, responded to his status inquiry, or\nprovided information in writing as to why the placement was interrupted.\n Foster Parent A has been a foster parent for over a decade, and he handle\nhigh level care, at risk youths. He wishes to remain in compliance and to\ncontinue servicing children in foster care through the state of Michigan.\nOn 8/2/2021 and 8/4/2021 I spoke with Foster Parent A about this complaint. Foster\nParent A acknowledged the information in the complaint and reported the following:\n Youth 1 was initially in a shelter bed via his foster home, and Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) C was making sure his home became a regular bed placement\nfor Youth 1.\n\n3",
    " A children services person and the police came to his home on 7/28/2021 or\n7/29/2021, (he was not certain of the date) around 8:00pm and removed\nYouth 1 from his home. They did not tell him why Youth 1 was being\nremoved. They did not report there was a concern of abuse or neglect nor\nthat that was why Youth 1 was being removed. The police and the children\nservices person only said they were told to remove Youth 1 from Foster\nParent A’s foster home.\n The morning after Youth 1’s removal, he called FCW C, Youth 1’s foster care\nworker. FCW C reported not knowing why Youth 1 was removed. FCW C\nreported no one told her Youth 1 was being removed. FCW C reported she\nhad spoken with their licensing department a day or so prior to this removal,\nand the licensing staff reported Youth 1 was in Foster Parent A’s home to\nstay.\n He went to the agency later that day and contacted the foster care supervisor.\nThat supervisor did not know why Youth 1 was removed. FCW C and that\nsupervisor were reaching out to DHHS-NC’s licensing department for\nanswers.\n Sometime later in the day, after Youth 1’s removal, Licensing Supervisor B\ncalled him and reported that an Ennis Center for Children staff person\nreported that Foster Parent A, said Foster Parent A put a “hit out” on\nLicensing Supervisor B.\n He asked Licensing Supervisor B why she would call him if he had a put a hit\nout on her. He asked Licensing Supervisor B whether he had ever made\nthreats against her, and Licensing Supervisor B said, no. Licensing\nSupervisor B reported she had no issues or concerns with him.\n Licensing Supervisor B, nor anyone else reported that Youth 1 was removed\nfrom the foster home due to concerns of abuse or neglect.\n There is an active special evaluation against his home as of 7/8/2021, but that\nis related to the 11year old and 15-year foster boys, who were placed in his\nfoster home getting into a fight. He affirmed that the agency would have been\nconcerned with supervision of those youths, which he indicated would not\nhave been an issue. He reported that Licensing Supervisor B denied to him\nthat Youth 1 removal was due to that special evaluation.\n He denied knowing why an Ennis Center for Children staff person would\nreport that he had threatened DHHS staff. He said if Ennis believed that, why\nthen would Ennis want him to take back Youth 2 who had been in respite and\nwas to return to his care. He advised Ennis he would not take Youth 2 back\ninto his foster home; but then that he could not do so due to advisement by\nDHHS.\n He denied making threats against Licensing Supervisor B or any DHHS staff.\n He believes Youth 1’s removal was due to him threatening to transfer his\nlicense. He said, he, his mother, and a few others are the only shelter beds in\nWayne County and Licensing Supervisor B has threatened to tear up their\ncontracts for not answering their phones. The morning of Youth 1’s removal\nfrom his home, he told Licensing Worker E he was transferring his license. At\n2:00pm Licensing Worker E texted him to inquired as to who are the youths\n4",
    "placed in his care, then at 8:00pm Youth 1 was removed. Youth 1 was upset\nand crying at the removal.\n He never received or asked for anything in writing related to the reason for\nYouth 1’ removal.\n A family team meeting (FTM) has not occurred since Youth 1’s removal.\n He did not request a foster care review board review and denied being\nadvised of the possibility. He said prior to Ennis emailing Licensing\nSpecialist D of him allegedly threatening Wayne County DHHS-NC agency\nstaff, the DHHS-NC had not reported a concern with him.\nOn 8/4/2021 I reviewed the email and written documentation Chief Administrator 0\nprovided related to the reason for Youth 1’s removal from Foster Parent A’s home.\nChief Administrator 0 email indicated:\n Youth 1 was replaced after hours due to explicit threats made by Foster\nParent A to DHHS staff and a staff at Ennis Center.\n They replaced Youth 1 in the evening and then Licensing Supervisor B\ncontacted Foster Parent A on the next business day. Licensing Supervisor B\nadvised Foster Parent A that the threat was the reason for youth 1’s\nreplacement.\n Chief Administrator 0 sent Foster Parent A a zero-tolerance letter.\n A complaint was filed by DHHS-NC staff with Gibraltar Police Department.\nChief Administrator 0 attached the letter and information his department provided to\nGibraltar Police. It included a statement from Placement Specialist G and Ennis Center\nStaff Person X regarding Foster Parent A’s s behavior and his derogatory and\ninflammatory comments. The referenced documents were:\n Placement Specialist G’s statement, which was from an incident report written\npertaining to an incident on 7/6/2021. That statement/incident report narrative\nalleged what Foster Parent A reported to Placement Specialist G. This incident\nreport included sexual threats towards the husbands and sons of workers, and\nother derogatory statements. This included alleging that he had a gun, (carry).\n Ennis Center Staff Person (ECSP) X’s statement, which was from a 7/29/2021\nemail sent to Licensing Specialist D. ECSP X had a foster child in Foster Parent\nA’s home. The email indicated:\n “I do have concerns with Foster Parent A’s thought process in thinking that\neveryone is fearful of investigating his home. He has claimed on multiple\noccasions that he has many contacts through DHHS and CPS, and no one\ninvestigates him because they know how he runs his home. He also reports\nto carry a gun into DHHS when he comes in? My other concern was that on\n07/09/2021, when I did my well child check on CD, Foster Parent A stated\nthat he had threatened to beat up a licensing worker in the past when she\nwas investigating his home, and he stated a few minutes later into the\nconversation.”\n Chief Administrator 0’s letter to Foster Parent dated 7/30/2021 which indicated”\n5",
    " Dear Foster Parent A,\n“This letter is in response to verbal threats on Wayne County\nMDHHS employees on 7/6/2021 and 7/9/2021. It is reported\non both dates that you described an explicit act of harm to\nMDHHS staff. As a result of these threats, this matter has\nbeen referred to the Gibraltar Police Department for further\ninvestigation.\nThe Department of Human Services attempts to provide\nservices to our foster parents with dignity and respect.\nLikewise, we expect your visits to our office and/or\ninteraction with staff to be mutually respectful. This includes\nany telephone conversations and/or any face-to-face\ncontacts. If you should be required to visit one of our\nMDHHS Child Welfare offices, I would respectfully request\nadvanced notice of your visit via telephone at 313-852-1708.\nMDHHS has a Zero Tolerance policy for actual or\nthreatened violence.\nPROHIBITED THREATENING BEHAVIOR INCLUDES:\n Engaging in any threatening or assaultive behavior.\n Engaging in behaviors, which cause another to feel\nterrorized, frightened, or intimidated.\n Any threat to do harm to another person or property.\nAll reported threats or incidents of violence will be\ninvestigated. The Department will presume that any threat\nmade will constitute a statement of intent to do harm.\nMDHHS will prosecute individuals who violate the Zero\nTolerance standards to the extent permitted by law.\nIt is our desire to continue to provide services to you and\nyour family, we therefore, ask that you be mindful of our\nZero Tolerance policy when you visit a county office of the\nMDHHS or in your future contacts with MDHHS staff.”\nChief Administrator 0 also reported conferencing this matter with Lansing Consultant\nXX.\nOn 8/9/2021 I spoke with ECSP X. ECSP X confirmed the information Chief\nAdministrator 0 reported that ECSP X provided by email. Additionally, ECSP X\nacknowledged she had a foster child in Foster Parent A’s foster home. ECSP X\nreported information as reported by Foster Parent A related to a physical altercation\n6",
    "occurring between Youth 3(age 15) and the child under her agency’s care, Youth\n2(age 11). The physical altercation resulted with Youth 2 needing medical attention.\nECSP X made a home visit to Foster Parent A’s home on 7/9/2021 related to that\nphysical altercation incident. At that home visit, Foster Parent A voiced statements\nabout DHHS-NC. Foster Parent A reported DHHS does not investigate him,\nbecause they know how he runs his home, and they are fearful of losing his home.\nFoster Parent A said he carries a gun when he visits DHHS, and in the past he\nthreatened to beat up a licensing worker who was investigating his home; and the\nlicensing worker quit. Additionally, that he is not above paying someone up to\n$10,000 for an address. Foster Parent A did not elaborate on the statement related\nto paying for an address, but Foster Parent A made that comment when he was\ntalking about threatening the licensing worker. Foster Parent A was talking very fast\nwhen he made those statements. After this incident, ECSP X shared the information\nFoster Parent A reported with her supervisor, but not DHHS. She provided the\ninformation to Licensing Specialist D on 7/29/2021, after Licensing Specialist D’s\n7/28/2021 email to her asking whether ECSP X had any information and or concerns\nrelated to Foster Parent A. ECSP X emailed Licensing Specialist D back on\n7/29/2021 indicating her concerns with Foster Parent A’s “thought process”, and the\ninformation as outlined in her email, as described earlier in this report.\nECSP X was not aware of Youth 1’s removal until Foster Parent A informed her on\n8/2/2021. She affirmed Foster Parent A’s reporting that Youth 2 had been on respite\nand was due to return to Foster Parent A’s home. She was trying to facilitate Youth\n2’s return when Foster Parent A advised her DHHS-NC said he could not take Youth\n2 into his home. On 7/29/2021 Licensing Supervisor B advised her Youth 2 could\nnot return to Foster Parent A’s home due to concerns of poor supervision in Foster\nParent A’s home.\nOn 8/11/2021 I interviewed Licensing Supervisor B by telephone. I also had email\ncontacts/ information from her after 8/11/2021, as indicated earlier under the\nmethodology section of this report. Licensing Supervisor B reported a letter\nnotification was not sent to Foster Parent A explaining why there was a placement\nchange. The explanation occurred verbally. She telephoned Foster Parent A on\n7/30/2021. She explained why Youth 1’s removal took place and reminded him he\nhad a special evaluation already open. She told Foster Parent A concerns had\ncome up that he had made threats against DHHS -NC employees. She said, she\nknew Foster Parent A was angry at her, and she asked him whether he had made\nthreats against her. He denied making threats. She never told him that she knew he\nhad not threatened her.\nLicensing Supervisor B reported the threat allegations by Foster Parent A came by\nway of a 7/6/2021 incident involving Placement Specialist G, and an email from\nECSP X to the licensing specialist on 7/29/2021 Licensing Supervisor B reported\nthere was no agency movement on the 7/6/2021 incident report because she had\nnot taken it seriously; and there was no threat of harm until notification of the\n7/29/2021 email from ECSP X. With regards to the 7/6/2021 incident, Licensing\n7",
    "Supervisor B reported Placement Specialist G told her what happened, that Foster\nParent A “was being nasty”. She advised Placement Specialist G to complete the\nincident report. She spoke with Placement Specialist G’s immediately supervisor the\nnext day and that supervisor reported she would follow up on the matter.\nOn 8/11/2021 I interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) C by telephone. FCW C\nreported not being apprised of or given notice of anything related to Youth 1’s\nremoval until after the fact. She received an email the next day saying he was\nreplaced. She spoke with Foster Parent A the next day after Youth 1’s removal and\nFoster Parent A reported not receiving notice either. She sent an email to Licensing\nSupervisor B asking about Youth 1’s emergency removal after he was just placed in\nFoster Parent A’s home on a permanent bed yesterday. FCW C reported she had no\ninformation on the abrupt removal and asked to be filled in so that she could provide\nclarify for herself and Youth 1’s mother as to whether this placement is no longer\navailable.\nFCW C reported she did not do an official family team meeting or DHS-69 for Youth\n1’s placement change. She was trying to find out the issues. FCW C reported not\nbeing apprised of the allegations of threats to departmental staff until just recently,\nafter she sought answers.\nOn 8/31/2021 I interviewed Licensing Specialist D by telephone. Licensing\nSpecialist D reported Foster Parent A never asked her why Youth 1 was replaced\nfrom Foster Parent A’s home.\nReviewed\n Youth 1’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n Youth 1 was placed in Foster Parent A’s foster home on 7/14/2021.\n Various social work contacts to/from and by various DHHS-NC staff on\n7/29/2021 related to the need to complete an emergency removal of Youth 1\nfrom Foster Parent A’s foster home. Of the need to not give Foster Parent A\nnotice of the move or reason for the removal; to use on-call children services\nto conduct the replacement; of efforts made to place Youth 1 at the Wolverine\nShelter; that the police accompanied the on-call worker for Youth 1’s removed\nfrom Foster Parent A’s home. That the replacement and transport of Youth 1\nwent without incident, but Youth 1 was visibly agitated from being removed.\nThat the on-call worker was to advise Foster Parent A to contact the foster\ncare worker for details about the removal and reason for it the next day.\nYouth 1 was placement at Wolverine Shelter.\n The reason for Youth 1’s replacement was not documented in his MISACWIS\nfile.\n No documentation of an FTM or DHS-69 prior 8/11/2021.\n Placement Specialist G’s statement/ incident report pertaining to an incident\non 7/6/2021.\n8",
    " Copy of the email FCW C sent to Licensing Supervisor B on 7/30/2021 asking\nabout Youth 1’s removal from Foster Parent A’s home, the viability of the\nplacement. Also Licensing Supervisor B’s reply to her on 8/2/2021, which was\nthat Foster Parent A was undergoing an investigation on very serious\nallegations against him. Youth 1 was removed for his safety, as well as the\nsafety of any DHHS specialists who must go to his home.\n Foster Parent A’s MISACWIS case record as outline later in this report.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild's record before a change of placement occurs:\n(I) That the current foster parent was notified in writing\nof the following information:\n(i) Not less than 14 calendar days in advance, of the\nchange, except when prior notification would jeopardize the\nchild’s care or safety. If prior notice is not provided, then\nthe agency shall notify the foster parent, at the time of the\nchange, why prior notice was not given.\nANALYSIS: The foster parent was not provided prior notice of the change of\nplacement on 7/29/2021 due to safety concerns, an allegation of\nthreat of harm towards agency employees had previously been\nmade by the foster parent.\nA verbal explanation as to why the youth was replaced from the\nfoster home was provided to the foster parent via telephone by\nthe licensing supervisor on 7/30/2021. Given the nature of the\nsafety concern, in this instance, the verbal explanation meets\nthe intent of this rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency failed to provide the foster parent with appropriate complaint information\nor schedule a timely interview since the initiation of the special evaluation on\n7/8/2021. The foster parent is seeking information on the status of his license and\nhas received no response.\nINVESTIGATION\nOn 8/2/2021 and 8/4/2021, I spoke with Foster Parent A. Foster Parent A reported\nknowing a special investigation had been initiated against his foster home. He\nreported there is an active special evaluation against his home as of 7/8/2021,\nrelated to his 11 year and 15-year foster boys getting into a physical fight. He\n9",
    "affirmed that the agency would have been concerned with supervision of the youths,\nwhich he indicated would not have been an issue. He did not report a concern with\nthe agency not contacting him for an interview.\nOn 8/11/2021 I interviewed Licensing Supervisor B by telephone and had email\ncontacts with her as indicated earlier in this report. Licensing Supervisor B reported\nFoster Parent A was provided information about the nature of the allegation against\nhim with respect to the 7/8/2021 special evaluation by Licensing Specialist D.\nLicensing Supervisor B reported after the initiation of the first special investigation,\nand prior to this complaint against DHHS-NC, Foster Parent A did not contact her\nrelated to the status of his license. He contacted her by email on 8/20/2021. She\nprovided me a copy of that email from him that indicated:\n He wanted to know when they were planning on coming out to do the\ninterview for him. “because different agency wanted to place there kids in the\nhome in I told them I am still Under investigation. In that I am Cooperating to\nget it done because I no there are looking for home for teenagers boys. Also\nI still have a child in Residential in his mother stated that she would like him\nplace back in the home because he getting An patient there because he want\nto come back. I am not trying to rush no one. But I feel bad for him being\nthere in he was doing good in my home.”\nLicensing Supervisor B reported Licensing Specialist D would have had follow up\ncontacts with Foster Parent A. Licensing Supervisor B reported, she contacted\nFoster Parent A on 7/30/2021 and explained why Youth 1’s removal took place; and\nshe notified Foster Parent A that he was on a special evaluation as they had\nadditional findings. She informed him Licensing Specialist D would be contacting\nhim.\nOn 8/31/2021 I interviewed Licensing Specialist D by telephone. She was assigned\nthe first special evaluation for Foster Parent A on 7/8/2021. She contacted Foster\nParent A by telephone on 7/13/2021 and gave Foster Parent A the description of the\nallegations against his foster home and the foster home rules the allegations related\nto. She told him the special evaluation had to do with the fight that occurred with\nyouths in his home, and whether there was proper supervision during that time. She\ndid not send him a letter outlining those things. A follow up letter is not something\nthey do. She scheduled interviews for him and others in his home for 7/15/2021.\nShe interviewed him on 7/15/2021, at which time she told him he could have a third\nparty there prior to his interview and she reminded him of the allegations. She\nreported that prior to DCWL’s receipt of the complaint this special investigation\nrelates; Foster Parent A contacted her once about the status of his license. Foster\nParent A texted her on 7/28/2021 asking for an update and she replied back to him\nthat same date. She has had other contacts with Foster Parent A since related to a\nsecond special evaluation pertaining to his foster home. This second special\nevaluation was initiated on 8/11/2021 with respect to alleged verbal threats to\nDHHS-NC staff by Foster Parent A. Licensing Specialist D reported this second\nspecial evaluation was not initiated sooner, because Licensing Supervisor B and\n10",
    "Chief Administrator 0 had been meeting about the matter and Licensing Supervisor\nB was communicating with DCWL as to whether the alleged verbal threats by Foster\nParent A could be rolled into the 7/8/2021 special evaluation or whether a new\nspecial evaluation needed to be opened. On 8/11/2021, Licensing Supervisor B\ninformed her they needed to open a second special evaluation and to contact Foster\nParent A. Licensing Specialist D telephoned Foster Parent A that same day and\ninformed him of the allegations to this second evaluation, and that she would contact\nhim later.\nReviewed\nFoster Parent A’s MISACWIS provider file which showed the following contacts by\nLicensing Specialist D:\n Information as reported by Licensing Specialist D related to her telephone\ncontact with Foster Parent A on 7/13/2021 and home visit to Foster Parent\nA’s home on 7/15/2021.\n Licensing Specialist D spoke with Licensing Worker E about an open special\nevaluation and putting Foster Parent A’s home on hold until the special\nevaluation was completed.\n Licensing Specialist D received an email from Foster Parent A on 7/28/2021\nstating \"Hello just want an update. They have a kid that they want me to take.\n Licensing Specialist D contacted Foster Parent A back by text on 7/28/ 2021\nand advised him of the following “This special evaluation was assigned to me\non 7/08/2021. We have approximately 45 days to complete the investigation\nand submit results. I am currently still investigating this matter. I will be\nreaching out to you soon with more questions and an update on the\ninvestigation. If you have anything else to share regarding this case, please\nfeel free to give me a call. Unfortunately, while this investigation is still\npending you are unable to take placement of any new youth.\"\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(2) An agency shall inform foster parents of all of the\nfollowing before they are questioned or interviewed\nregarding a special evaluation.\n(b) a clear description of the allegations.\n11",
    "ANALYSIS: The foster parent was provided a clear description of the\nallegations, interviewed timely and given updates on the status\nof the special evaluation. The foster parent, as well as, the\nlicensing specialist who informed the foster parent of the\nallegation descriptions and updates, both acknowledged that the\nspecial evaluation related to a physical altercation between two\nyouths who were placed in Foster Parent A’s foster home and\nwhether there was proper supervision occurring.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION\nFoster Parent A reported a family team meeting (FTM) has not occurred since Youth 1’s\nremoval\nINVESTIGATION\nI interviewed FCW C on 8/11/2021. FCW C reported she did not complete a formal\nFTM. She and her supervisor had a telephone case conference with Foster Parent A\nand Youth 1’s parent related to the fact the replacement had occurred. FCW C reported\nnot having clear details around the reason for Youth 1’s removal, but they discussed the\nmatter, and she sought to obtain further details.\nMISACWIS documentation showed FCW C was advised not to give Foster Parent A\nforewarning of Youth 1’s 7/29/2021 removal. Additionally, that the on-call staff were to\nadvise Foster Parent A to contact the foster care worker for details about the removal\nand reason for it the next day.\nA follow up review of MISACWIS by me after 8/11/2021 showed FCW C documented\nher contact with the parties on 7/30/2021 as an FTM. The social work contact entered\non 8/11/2021 indicated:\n An ‘Impromptu FTM” was held with FCW C’s supervisor, Foster Parent A,\nand Youth 1’s mother via telephone.\n Youth 1 was removed from Foster Parent A’s home with no notice and Foster\nParent A came to the office to speak to Chief Administrator 0. At that time,\nan FTM was held with all parties via phone and face to face with worker and\nsupervisor. FTM document uploaded indicated: Youth 1 remains removed\ntoday and Foster Parent A and Youth 1’s mother both asking why. However,\nthe worker and supervisor had very little information to provide. New\nplacement is still being sought out.\n Youth 1 was placed in Wolverine shelter. Licensing worker and supervisor\nwere asked for answers.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nContract Policy Family team meeting.\nFOM 722-6 B\nPlacement Preservation/Disruption\n12",
