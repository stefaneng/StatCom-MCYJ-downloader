    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 8/16/21, youth was placed in lockdown in retaliation for telling on a staff member,\npreventing youth from going on a field trip. Staff member calls youth inappropriate\nnames and speaks negatively about youth's weight. Staff member does not interject\nwhen there are physical altercations between youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred for licensing investigation on 08/17/21. The complaint\nnoted the following:\nYouth A has been placed at The Children Methodist Home since Mid-June of\n2021. On 08/16/2021, Youth A was placed on lock down in retaliation from telling\non Staff 1 preventing Youth A from going to a waterpark. Staff 1 calls Youth A\n\"faggot, gay and speaks negatively about Youth A’s weight\". Staff 1 does not get\ninvolved with children in the facility, that are involved in physical\naltercations…There are concerns that Staff 1 is neglecting the safety as Staff 1\nstated \" he can do what he wants, as nothing is going to happen to him. Other\ncomplaints have been made by other children in the facility.\nOn 09/15/21, the complainant emailed to confirm that they had nothing else to add to\nthe original allegations.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 08/19/21. In regard to the allegations, Youth A\nreported that Staff 1 and Staff 2 call youth, including Youth A, names such as, “fags,\ngay, ladies, and fat.” Youth A reported that these names have been said by the staff\ndirectly to him. Youth A said that other youths laugh when the staff say these things,\nbut Youth A takes offense and has told them to stop, but they haven’t. Youth A said\nthe last time this occurred with Staff 1 calling Youth A, Youth E, and Youth F “fags.”\nYouth A reported that Staff 2, Staff 4, and maybe Staff 3 heard this. Youth A further\nreported that Staff 1 has also made statements such as, “What is said in the cottage\nstays in the cottage.” Youth A said that Staff 1 said this in response to Staff 1 being\nmad about Youth A making a complaint about Staff 1 to Staff 5 and Staff 6. Youth A\nsaid that he thinks he did not get to go on an outing because of making this\ncomplaint. Youth A also said that Staff 1 has said that the youths cannot get him\nfired or in trouble and that he hears what the youths say about him to others.\nI interviewed Youths B, C, D, E, and F, on 08/19/21, at the facility. Youths B, C, and\nD denied any name calling by staff. They also denied any intimidation, bullying, or\nstaff acting like they can treat youths poorly without consequences. Youths B and C\nfurther denied that any staff allow youths to fight without breaking it up immediately.\nYouth D reported that sometimes some staff (would not specify who) would take\ntheir time intervening in fights. Youth D said this occurred months ago but is not\noccurring currently. Youth E reported that one time, Staff 1 called him a thief when\nYouth E stole something. Youth E said he has a history of stealing. Youth E said that\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 do get loud sometimes, but don’t name call. Youth E denied that\n4",
    "staff allow youths to fight. None of the youth reported that the entire cottage would\nbe disciplined if one or two youth were getting in trouble.\nYouth F reported that Staff 1 and Staff 2 call youth names such as the ones\nidentified in the allegations “all the time.” Youth F said the last time was the day\nbefore when Staff 1 said for the group to “come and eat, fags” and “come and eat,\nladies.” Youth F said that Staff 2 heard this, as well as Staffs 3 and 4. Youth F said\nthat he reported something about this to Staff 5 last week and then Staff 1 started\ntalking about how the youths couldn’t get the staff fired. Youth F said that the group\nhas been punished for one to two youths acting out as well. These punishments\ninclude early bedtimes and removal of electronics. Youth F said Staff 1 and Staff 2\nalso let youths fight. Youth F first said that this has not happened to Youth F directly,\nbut then said it last occurred two weeks ago when Youth F was in a fight with a peer\nand Staff 2 sat there and laughed before breaking it up. Youth F said that other\nyouths and staff were around but did not recall specifically who.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 08/19/21. Staff 1 denied calling the youths\nnames as noted in the allegations. Staff 1 said that the youths “twist” things, such as\nwhen he has spoken to some youths about overeating or snacking too much, they\nlater said he called them fat. Staff 1 said that Youth A is one of the youths who has\nthis tendency to take things the wrong way. Regarding using the terms “fag” or “gay,”\nStaff 1 denied calling youths those names. Staff 1 reported that Youth F told the\ngroup that he was gay by saying, “I’m gay. I’m a fag.” Youth F mentioned to the\ngroup that he has acted out with Youth E as well. Staff 1 said that he addressed\nYouth F on using the word “fag,” but it was at that point that other youths started\ncalling him names. The staff address the youth when they use those words. Staff 1\ndenied calling youths “retarded, ladies, idiots,” or other names. Staff 1 also denied\nsaying or suggesting that he can’t get fired, but noted that he has addressed the\nyouths’ comments of intending to get staff fired in group settings. Staff 1 said he told\nthe youths that he doesn’t do anything to get fired and that they can make whatever\ncomplaints they want to. Staff 1 denied using consequences for the whole cottage\nfor one to two youths’ misbehavior. Staff 1 did state that the whole group sometimes\nacts out and that’s when they would all receive consequences like early bedtimes or\nremoving Netflix privileges. Staff 1 said that he and the other staff always intervene\nin fights and to so immediately. Staff 1 said that they step between youths and\nseparate them. He denied allowing youth to fight or laughing while youths were\nfighting. Staff 1 denied not allowing Youth A on the outing for voicing his concerns.\nI interviewed Staff 2, Staff 3, and Staff 4 at the facility on 08/19/21. All of these staff\nconfirmed that they typically work in this cottage, and all have worked with Staff 1.\nNone of the staff reported hearing Staff 1, Staff 2, or any other staff call the youth\nnames. Staff 2 said that youth sometimes take things the wrong way, but denied\ncalling youth names, such as in the allegations. Staff 2 reported that Youth F has\ntold the other residents that he had a boyfriend, and the other boys were calling him\n“gay,” but not staff. Staff 3 said that there was one time that staff told Youth E to stop\nbeing a thief after Youth E had stolen something. Youth E has reportedly stolen\n5",
    "numerous times. Staff 3 said that the staff don’t call the youth names, but the youths\nuse those names with one another and toward staff. Staff 3 identified Youth F as one\nyouth who name calls and makes sexual comments. Staffs 2, 3, and 4 denied any\nknowledge of any staff saying things like they could do what they wanted to the\nyouth and not get in trouble or fired. All three denied saying or suggesting that\nthemselves as well. All three staff denied that any staff let youths fight or sit and\nlaugh when youth fight. Staff 2 said that the youth will sometimes say that staff let\nthem fight, if the youth was hit in the process and feels that he needs to blame it on\nthe staff. Staff 2 denied letting youth fight or laughing at youth while they were\nfighting. Staff 3 did identify Staff 7 as being “lazy” and slow to respond to anything.\nStaff 3 said that Staff 7 does not let youths fight, but does not observe the youth’s\nbehaviors well, so there may be more fights when Staff 7 is there. The staff also\nreported that some of the youths have made remarks about trying to get staff fired.\nDuring telephone calls and emails with Youth A’s worker, the worker established a\nsafety plan to have Youth A separated from Staff 1 during this investigation. I\nadvised Youth A’s worker that Youth A identified his therapist, family worker, and\nStaff 3 as individuals he could go to with concerns.\nI asked Administrator 2 if staff were allowed to change the daily schedule that was\nprovided for my review. On 08/24/21, Administrator 2 emailed,\nOur goal is to have a consistent schedule. However, in residential the staff can\nadjust the schedule based upon what is going on in the cottage. For example, if\nthey are having major problems with youth being aggressive etc., they could ask\nthat they spend time in their rooms to help settle the cottage.\nOn 09/15/21, I emailed Staff 5 to inquire about the allegations noted in this report.\nStaff 5 replied with the following,\nWhen I have talked with Youth A in the past during events or in passing, he has\ninformed me that Staff 1 has bullied him, called him names, and has told him and\nothers in the cottage “what is said in the cottage stays in the cottage.” He has\nalso said to me that it is a “Loyalty” environment in his cottage where if the youth\ndoesn’t say anything then they have more privileges such as TV, electronics, and\ntime outside. As soon as I was told this information I informed my supervisor,\nwho also brought in the Chief Administrator for me to inform as well.\nStaff 5 reported further that she advised the Chief Administrator on 08/13/21.\nOn 09/15/21, I emailed Staff 6 to inquire about the allegations noted in this report.\nStaff 6 replied with the following,\nThank you for reaching out. Youth A mentioned to me that Staff 1 has called him\nand the youth “snitches” if he or they “told on” others for something. He also had\nstated that Staff 1 would not allow him and a peer to talk to or be around a\ncertain MCHS employee (Staff 5). When asked, Youth A said that it was because\nof something that he and the peer said to her that “could get Staff 1 in trouble,\nand he [Staff 1] had a meeting with admin.” He did not want to tell me specific\ndetails about the situation or conversation when asked. After this, he said that he\n6",
    "felt targeted by Staff 1 in that he was not allowed to go off-grounds for an activity\nbut the other peer that also talked to Staff 5 was allowed to go.\nOn 09/15/21, the Chief Administrator emailed the following,\nOn Monday August 16th, a member of the development team notified her\nsupervisor that a Harrison Cottage youth informed her that the youth are not\nallowed to leave the cottage or attend outings/events. There was an off-site water\npark event on the 16th which was facilitated by Development. Administrator 2\nwas notified who immediately began an internal review and on the\n16th interviewed Staff 1, cottage supervisor X and Shift Supervisor.\nDuring emails and telephone call on 09/21/21, Administrator 2 reported that she was\ntold from the Chief Administrator, who had heard the report from someone else, of\nsome concerns mostly related to the youth not being able to attend some outings.\nAdministrator 2 said that she began an internal review but stopped when this\ninvestigation began as she assumed it was one in the same and did not want to\ninterfere in the investigation. Per Administrator 2, the complaint she received was\ngeneral and not specific to cottages, staff, or youth. Administrator 2 said that she did\nspeak to Staff 1, as well as other staff, about this and let him and the others know\nthat the youth should be attending activities and outings unless there was some\nextreme behavioral or other issue preventing safe participation. Administrator 2 said\nthat there had been a recent water park activity put on by the facility’s Development\nprogram and reminded the staff that the youths should be attending events like this.\nAdministrator 2 also reported that she spoke to Staff 1 about one boy reporting that\nhe was called “fat.” Staff 1 denied calling any youth “fat” and said that he talked to\nthem about health and eating habits.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows with applicable\ninformation outlined:\n Staff 1 has no disciplinary action in his employee record\n Daily schedule for Harrison Cottage with sleeping hours noted\n Facility policy Section E. Number 11. Behavior Intervention Plan.\n Facility policy Section F. Number 6. Child Discipline Policy. MCHS does not\nsanction any form of verbal, nonverbal, or emotional abuse such as but not\nlimited to; swearing, screaming at children, yelling at children, ridiculing,\nsarcasm toward youth, unflattering nicknames, withholding of food,\nhumiliation, derogatory comments about children and/or the children’s\nfamilies, cursing, or any other non-sanctioned approaches, etc.\n Facility policy Section F. Number 16. Consequences. …Various\nconsequences can include not allowing a child to participate in an\nactivity…Other rules to remember when it comes to implementing\nconsequences: 1. The final decision on consequences rests with the cottage\nsupervisor. He/she must solicit feedback from the staff, case managers,\ntherapists, and management.\n Facility policy Section F. Number 18. Physical Intervention.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(b) Disciplining a group for the misbehavior of individual\ngroup members.\n(c) Verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with the rule. There is insufficient\nevidence to support the allegations that staff are calling youth\nnames, bullying youth, or using group consequences for\nindividual behavior. Although two of the youth interviewed did\nreport this, the other four did not. None of the staff reported\nhearing or using name calling with youth. None of the staff\nreported use of group consequences for select youth\nmisbehavior. The use of removal of privileges, such as not\nallowing a youth on an outing, is provided for within the facility’s\n“consequences” policy.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is highly recommended that thorough documentation of\nimplementation of consequences occurs in order to provide a\nclear understanding of what consequences were used with\nyouth, and why they were implemented. Documentation of the\nrequired supervisor, clinical team and management review\nshould also be documented, as it is required in the facility policy\nfor implementation of consequences.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n8",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nYouth are not allowed to leave their rooms until 10:30 AM and are sent to their\nrooms around 6:30 PM.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was transferred for licensing investigation on 08/17/21. The complaint\nnoted the following:\nThe children awake by 8:00am but are not allowed to leave their room until\n10:30am. The children are being sent to their rooms around 6:30pm instead of\n8:30pm.\nI interviewed six youth for this investigation (Youths A, B, C, D, E, and F). All of them\nreported that summer and weekend bedtimes are between 8:00-9:30pm. Two youth\nreported that during school they went to bed between 7:00-8:00pm. Five of the youth\nreported that they wake up at 10:30am. The youth consistently reported that if they\nwake up prior to 10:30am, they are not allowed to come out of their rooms other than\nto use the restroom, get something to drink, and get some fruit if they are hungry. If\nthey come out of their rooms, they must return and remain until 10:30am.\nI interviewed four staff for this investigation (Staffs 1, 2, 3, and 4). Staff 1 reported\nthat when the youth wake up, they do their hygiene, clean rooms, and do their\nchores, and they are done with all of that by 10:30am. Staff 1 reported that if the\nyouth wake up and are done with all of that before 10:30am, that they are allowed to\ncome out of their rooms. All four staff reported that bedtimes during the summer and\nweekends are between 8:00-9:00pm. Staffs 2, 3, and 4 said bedtime hours during\nschool was between 7:00-8:00pm, while Staff 1 said it was between 8:00-9:00pm.\nStaffs 2, 3, and 4 said that the youth are to remain in their rooms but can do hygiene\nand clean their room until 10:30am. Staff 3 said that having the youth remain in\nrooms until 10:30am was a “Methodist thing.” Early bedtime was consistently\nreported by the staff as 6:30pm and would be implemented for misbehavior such as\nfighting or property damage. This was noted to be specific to the youth involved and\nnot for the whole cottage unless the whole cottage was involved.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows with applicable\ninformation outlined:\n• Daily schedule for Harrison Cottage with sleeping hours noted. Weekend hours\nspecify wake up at 8:00am with option to sleep in until 10:30am. School day\nwake up times were listed as 6:30-7:00am. Bedtime was noted between 9:00-\n9:30pm for all days of the week.\n9",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is noncompliant with the rule as they have an\nestablished daily schedule that outlines bedtime hours, but the\nstaff are not following that schedule. It was established by youth\nand staff reports, that the youth typically go to bed around 7:00-\n8:00pm on school days and 8:00-9:30pm on summer days and\nweekends. The youth, and three of four staff, reported that if\nthey don’t have school that the youths are expected to remain in\ntheir rooms until 10:30am. They are permitted to come out to\nuse the restroom, get something to drink, or get some fruit if\nhungry, but are expected to go back to their rooms and remain\nthere until 10:30am. If the group or individual youth have\ndemonstrated behavioral issues, they might have received an\n“early bedtime” which is reportedly around 6:30pm. These times\nare extending well beyond the established bedtime hours and\nresult in youths being in their rooms for periods of up to 16\nhours at a time. This is well beyond a reasonable time for\nsleeping hours, which should not be longer than 10 hours in\nrooms. The facility is permitted to allow youth to sleep in beyond\nthe established sleeping hours but is not permitted to require\nyouth to remain in their rooms beyond the established sleeping\nhours for these extended periods. To do so is bordering on\nseclusion of the youth, so the facility must clarify the sleeping\nhours and advise the staff of the clarification as part of their\ncorrective action plan.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting a timely\nand acceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nSeptember 30, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 6, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n11"
