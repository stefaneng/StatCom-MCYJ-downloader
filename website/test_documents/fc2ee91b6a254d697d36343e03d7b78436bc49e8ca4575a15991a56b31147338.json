There was concern that Youth A\nhad a safety plan for increased supervision, due to multiple trips to\nthe emergency room, yet was able to self-harm. The hospital\ndenied access to agency social worker to obtain an update.\nOn 8/14/24, DCWL received notification that Youth A attempted to\nself-harm again on 8/13/24, after he was released from the\nhospital. Youth A was then taken back to the hospital under\ninpatient care, with plans to discharge to a secure facility.\nInterviews:\nClinical Director contacted DCWL via email on 8/12/24. Clinical\nDirector reported that Youth A attempted to hang himself around\n6:00PM, outside of the cottage. Police and ambulance were\ncontacted, and Youth A was transported to the hospital for an\nevaluation. Clinical Director was then interviewed face-to-face by\nDCWL and MDHHS Worker on 8/13/24. Clinical Director reported\nthat on 8/9/24 Youth A asked to make a call during dinner time.\nStaff and other youth were still eating. Staff told Youth A to wait for\na few minutes, then he could make his call. Youth A escalated\nand began throwing things. Management and crisis team were\ncontacted to assist. The crisis team consists of case managers\nand a behavioral specialist. Law Enforcement was also contacted.\nWhen the crisis team arrived, Youth A was in the cottage,\nattempting to self-harm. Youth A had a history of using clothing to\nput around his neck, then loop over a door. Staff attempted to\nremove items from Youth A’s possession at various times,\n2",
    "including a hair straightener cord, pants, and a blanket. Youth A\nhad some marks on his neck from items rubbing as staff removed\nthem. Law Enforcement transported Youth A to the hospital.\nYouth A was not on 1:1 supervision at that time. 1:1 supervision\nhas since been requested from DHHS. A 30-day notice was\nprovided to DHHS on 5/30/24. Youth A has had several incidents\nof attempted self-harm and indicates he continues this behavior as\nhe wants to move. The clinical team meets twice weekly to review\nhis needs. The current safety plan is heightened supervision, and\nthat staff are aware of Youth A's triggers and behaviors.\nYouth B was interviewed fact-to-face on 8/13/24 by DCWL and\nMDHHS Worker. Youth B was present during the alleged incident\non 8/9/24. Youth B stated that he observed Youth A take\nbelongings from Youth B’s cubby. Youth A used Youth B’s pants,\nwrapped them around his neck and tried to put them over a door.\nStaff were with him, following him and trying to talk to him. Staff\nattempted to get the item from Youth A, but Youth A would run\naway. When staff were able to get the pants away from Youth A,\nhe grabbed a flat iron out of Youth B’s cubby and attempted to use\nthe cord to hang himself. Staff chased Youth A and were able to\nget the flat iron from Youth A.\nYouth B stated that everything happened outside his door, which\nis why he was able to see it all. Youth B felt that Youth A was\n“playing” the whole time. Youth B stated that Youth A smiled at\nhim. Youth B stated that Youth A tries to self-harm when he wants\nsomething, because he feels he will get what he wants. Youth B\nstated he has also done this behavior and discussed it with Youth\nA. Youth B never heard Youth A state he really wanted to harm\nhimself. Youth B did not have any concerns about staff and stated\nthey are fair and take care of kids.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face on 8/13/24 by DCWL and\nMDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported she was present for the incident\non 8/9/24. The group was eating dinner when Youth A asked Staff\n2 to let him make a phone call. Staff 2 told Youth A that he needed\nto wait for about five minutes, until dinner was done. Youth A got\nupset, threw staff’s food, threw clothing and furniture around the\nunit. Youth A made verbal threats to beat up staff. Youth A then\ngrabbed a blanket and tried to tie it around his neck. Staff followed\nYouth A, encouraging him to stop his behavior. Youth A went to\nthe exit door and tried to throw the end of the blanket over the\nautomatic closure device. Staff stopped him and removed the\nblanket. Youth A then grabbed a hot iron from a peer’s cubby and\nput the cord around his neck. Staff again encouraged him to take\n3",
    "the cord off. Youth A tried to put the cord over the door, but was\nunsuccessful, as staff were talking with him and able to remove\nthe item. Youth A was never hanging.\nPreviously Youth A has used pieces of wood from outside, or\nplastic pieces he’s broken off items, and threatened to cut himself.\nTypically, Youth A will make the verbal threat, but never act on it.\nYouth A’s safety plan is to have staff sit outside of his door during\nsleeping hours and have increased supervision during awake\nhours. Staff are aware that Youth A needs to be supervised at all\ntimes. Staff did not attempt to restrain during incidents due to\nYouth A’s size and concern it would further escalate him. Staff\nhave been successful at preventing Youth A from harming himself\nthrough discussion and monitoring. Staff 1 indicated she did not\nbelieve Youth A really wanted to hurt himself. Youth A stated\nseveral times that he hated being there and wanted to leave.\nCase Manager was interviewed face-to-face on 8/15/24 by DCWL\nand MDHHS Worker. Case Manager reported the clinical review\nteam meets every day to discuss Youth A. The agency was\nadvocating for an inpatient program. Case Manager\nacknowledged it was difficult to limit Youth A’s access to outdoors\nor other areas, due to being a non-secure program. Youth A would\nsearch for other people’s belongings to use to attempt self-harm\nor Youth A would threaten to take his own clothing off and use it to\nself-harm. Case Manager stated Youth A is a great kid, but\nstruggles with impulsive behavior, which they continue to work on.\nCase Manager was not present for the incident on 8/9/24, but\nreported she was aware of what occurred. Staff at the facility are\ncertified in TCI. However, they did not restrain Youth A throughout\nthe incident as they felt he was not at imminent risk, and they\nwere able to prevent him from self-harm. Case Manager was\npresent for the incident on 8/13/24 as she walked into the unit and\nsaw Youth A with the curtains around his neck. Youth A was\nstanding on a shelf under the window, to reach the curtains. Staff\nwere standing on a couch to reach the curtains and cut them\ndown. Law Enforcement arrived 5-10 minutes after the curtains\nwere cut. Youth A was never hanging or suspended. Youth A was\nstanding on two feet the entire time. Case Manager was confident\nthe curtain rod would not have held his weight if he tried to get off\nhis feet. Case Manager observed staff to be verbally supportive\nand manage the environment throughout the incident. Youth A\nwas laughing and smiling. Youth A grabbed a towel and before he\ncould do anything, Case Manager was able to grab the towel from\nhim. Youth A laughed and stated, “You’re f***ing fast. How’d you\n4",
    "catch me?” Youth A has stated repeatedly that he wants to leave\nthe program.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed face-to-face on 8/15/24 by DCWL\nand MDHHS Worker. Supervisor 1 reported they were present for\nthe 8/9/24 incident. Supervisor 1 arrived on the unit after\nSupervisor 2 called for support. When Supervisor 1 arrived on the\nunit, staff were attempting to get Youth A to remove a cord from\naround his neck. Staff did not want to pull on the cord and risk\nhaving it tighten or cut it and risk cutting Youth A. Staff were\ntalking with Youth A as he was attempting to put the cord over the\ndoor. When the cord kept falling off the door and Youth A gave up\nand staff were able to get the hair straightener from him. All the\nother kids were in their bedrooms at the time. After giving up the\ncord, Youth A tried to tie a pair of pants around his neck. Youth A\nwas laughing and running from staff as they tried to remove the\npants. Supervisor 1 could not recall what Youth A was saying, but\nremembered staff were encouraging him to be safe and following\nhim to maintain arm’s length supervision. Youth A then ran out to\nthe fence and tried to put the pants over the top of the fence.\nSupervisor 1 spoke with Youth A and told him they were very\nworried he could get hurt, even if he did not intend to. Supervisor\n1 explained that if the pants were too tight on his neck, staff may\nnot be able to remove them in time. Supervisor 1 attempted to\nremove the pants from his neck when Youth A began to drop his\nweight. Supervisor 1 told Youth A that she was having a hard time\nuntying them. Youth A immediately stood up and she was able to\nuntie the item. Youth A was never suspended or hanging. Youth A\nwas not restrained as staff did not want to risk having him escalate\nand get injured.\nSupervisor 1 stated that staff are very aware that Youth A needs\nto be watched at all times. If Youth A attempts any self-injury, at\nleast three staff are needed to intervene, due to Youth A being\nvery tall and strong. In all prior incidents, Youth A would go to the\nlimit, then stop and allow staff to intervene.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed face-to-face on 8/15/24 by DCWL\nand MDHHS Worker.

Staff attempted to talk with Youth A, but he\nwalked away and grabbed a blanket and wrapped it around his\nneck. A code was called, and the other youth went into their\nrooms. Staff were able to remove the blanket from Youth A. Youth\nA then grabbed a flat iron from a peer’s cubby and put the cord\naround his neck.

After removing items, staff had to give\nyouth their belongings as needed, then return them to an area that\nYouth A cannot access.\nStaff 2 was also on the unit for the incident on 8/13/24.

Youth A went down the hallway, in\nview of staff and tried to attach himself to the emergency exit door.\nTwo additional staff entered the unit. Two staff went down the\nhallway. A third staff called for assistance. Third staff then went\ndown the hallway to assist. A fourth staff went down the hallway. A\nfifth staff then went down the hallway.

Two staff\nintervened at the door, then Youth A ran out the door.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and video review, the agency provided\nproper supervision and support when Youth A attempted to self-\nharm.\nTechnical Assistance:\nAs Youth A moved from one object to another throughout the unit,\nit was observed on the video that staff would remove an object\nfrom the youth and set it down, to run and intervene with the youth\nagain. While it is understandable staff had to move quickly to\nintervene, it was noted that several staff were available and one or\ntwo staff could have been tasked with removing objects from the\nunit, such as the blanket and peers clothing and personal\nbelongings, to prevent Youth A from obtaining them.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n9",
