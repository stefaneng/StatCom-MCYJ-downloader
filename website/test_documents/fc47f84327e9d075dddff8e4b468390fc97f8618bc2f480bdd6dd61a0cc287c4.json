    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was not provided medical attention when bleeding rectally.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAll interviews were conducted with MDHHS Worker face to\nface at the facility on 5/23/25.\nDirector reported Youth complained about bleeding from his\nrectum but refused medical attention. Youth refused his physical,\nfrom Nurse and from Doctor. Finally, Youth agreed to a blood\ndraw before his court hearing. At the court hearing, Youth reported\nhe wasn’t receiving medical attention. Due to this, the judge\nordered him to go to the hospital. He went to Hurley Hospital and\nwas released. He came back to the facility for a couple days,\nrefused to take his medication and then was released home.\nDirector reported Nurse is at the facility daily and the Doctor is\npresent three days a week but also will come in if Nurse contacts\nhim.\nNurse reported she works daily and collaborates with Doctor who\nphysically is present in the building three days a week and more if\nneeded. Nurse reported she saw Youth on 3/10/25 and there were\nno issues reported to her from him. On 4/8/25, Youth reported to\nher that he had blood in his urine. On 4/10/25, Youth was seen by\nDoctor and he refused the exam, but allowed a blood draw. Nurse\nreported because Youth would not allow them to examine him,\nshe had attempted other methods to see if there was a medical\nissue. Nurse reported she had given him a medical pad to put on\nso that they could assess how much blood, if any was being\nexpelled. Nurse reported he wore it but threw it away and did not\nallow them to see it. Nurse reported Doctor came in at least twice\nto attempt an exam and Youth refused. Nurse reported Youth was\nphysically active and no other symptoms or signs of a medical\ncondition were present. Youth was playing sports and\nweightlifting. After weightlifting in May, Youth reported he had\nrectal bleeding. An exam was scheduled with Doctor and he\nrefused the exam and he was placed on restrictions. Nurse\nreported at the court hearing on 5/13/25, Youth reported he wasn’t\ngetting medical attention. He was sent to Hurley Hospital. He\nstayed there a few days and received medication for Ulcerative\nColitis (inflammation of the bowels). Nurse reported he was given\nmedication from the hospital and Doctor prescribed iron pills as\nwell. He refused to take the iron pills Doctor prescribed and\nstated, “won’t be a guinea pig and take medication not from the\nhospital.” Nurse reported she did not feel he needed to go to the\n2",
    "hospital and Doctor never assessed him as needing to go to the\nhospital either.\nOn 6/11/25, Doctor was interviewed. Doctor reported he has\nworked for the facility for about 40 years. Doctor reported he\nphysically comes to the facility about three times a week,\nsometimes less and sometimes more depending on what the\nagency needs. Doctor reported if a youth wants to see the\nmedical team at the facility (after intake), then they fill out a\nrequest form, see Nurse and she completes an assessment. If\nNurse makes an assessment that the youth should see him, then\nshe schedules that with him (Doctor). Doctor reported there was\nno serious issue to send Youth to the hospital. Youth always\nrefused to be examined and continued to be active in the facility.\nDoctor reported on 4/24/25 Youth was seen by him and Youth\nrefused to allow the rectum examination. Doctor reported he\ndiscussed bowel movements with Youth to assess possible\nissues. On 5/2/25, Youth allowed him to complete a visual exam.\nYouth pulled his undergarments down and Doctor reported he was\nable to see that there was no bulging for possible hemorrhoids or\nfissures (cracks in the skin that may produce blood). Doctor\nreported he drew blood on 4/11/25 to assess whether Youth was\nanemic, this would allow Doctor to assess if he was bleeding\nexcessively. Doctor reported the results came back normal.\nDoctor reported they gave him a pad to assess bleeding, but\nYouth refused to show them. Doctor reported he had no reason to\nbelieve that Youth needed emergency health care. Youth had\nnever been seen with excessive bleeding, was active in sports,\nand blood draw was normal. Doctor reported Youth A was\ndiagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis which is inflamed bowel\nmovements. This can also be known as Chrones. Doctor reported\nthis diagnosis could only be discovered through scoping. Doctor\nreported there was no diagnosis of kidney stone, no infections and\nnormal blood draw.\nI attempted to interview Youth on 6/13/25 and 6/20/25. Voicemails\nwere left with no return phone call.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth intake documents were reviewed. Youth was seen\nby Nurse on 3/8/25, upon intake.

Youth was seen on 3/14/25\nand leg was diagnosed as a mild strain. Ibuprofen\ncontinued for five days.\n• On 4/8/25, Nurse received a phone call from Mother.\nMother reported Youth had been to the emergency room\nprior to being in placement and he was “internally\nbleeding.” Mother reported Youth was on the street for\ndays, using drugs and alcohol. Youth reported at this time\nthat he had blood in his urine and stool but had not told\nstaff about this. Staff reported they had not see this either\nor heard complaints. Nurse told Youth to let her know the\nnext time he saw blood.\n• 4/10/25, Nurse requested medical information from Hurley\nHospital in relation to Mother’s phone call. Hurley\ndocumentation reported that Youth went to the hospital but\nrefused to be examined; therefore no diagnosis.\n• 4/22/25 Youth was seen due to Health Service Request for\na painful tooth.
