This consultant reported that the\nvideo footage was reviewed, which showed Staff 1 hitting Youth B\nwith an orange and Staff 1 stated she does not remember this\nhappening.

This\nconsultant asked Staff 1 if she tried to kick a youth and she denied it.\nWhen told that it was seen on video that she attempted to kick Youth\nA in the head after she went to get the oranges, Staff 1 reported she\nwas just playing around and there was no malicious intent. She\nreported Youth A was trying to throw things back at her, so she\nthought it was a game. Staff 1 stated this situation was never meant\nto be aggressive and she was playing around with the youth. When\nasked if she is allowed to play around with the youth like this, she\nstated that she is not aware. She reported she is aware of the code\nof conduct she signed but is not sure what exactly was on there. Staff\n1 reported she had only been at the facility for about three months\n3",
    "and stated she did not mean to cause any harm to anyone.

Staff 1 appears to be jumping around and in a\npositive mood when throwing the oranges. Youth A then threw an\norange back at Staff 1, hitting her with the orange. He then grabs a\nbicycle rim and taunts Staff 1 by pretending to throw the bicycle rim\nat Staff 1. In response to this, Staff 1 is seen running towards Youth\nA and attempting to kick Youth A in the head, but her foot never\nmade contact with his body.
