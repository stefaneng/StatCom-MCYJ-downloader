Foster Care Specialist reported the admission process\nwas complete when the incident with Youth A occurred. She\nreported Staff 1 went through Youth A’s clothes and offered to\nshow Foster Care Specialist Youth A’s room.

Foster Care Specialist\nreported Support Staff contacted 911.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n1. Staff 1’s personnel file: There were two disciplinary\nactions found in the file, which were unrelated to this\ninvestigation. Staff 1 completed Medication Administrative\nand Documentation training on 12/9/24. Competency\ntraining completed on 2/3/25.\n2. Medication Storage Policy: Provides general guidelines\nto medication storage for residents. All Schedule II –IV\nmedications are to be locked in a medication cabinet.\n3. Admissions Process Policy: Upon admission, the\nadmitting Director Care Professional (DCP) or Supervisor\nwill greet the youth. The youth and their personal inventory\nwill be inspected. All medications must be handed over to\nthe admitting DCP. The DCP or nurse will review the\nmedications with the parent or guardian. All medications\nmust be in their original packaging (e.g., prescription\nbottles). Medications will be reported and documented for\nboth the psychiatrist and nurse and securely stored in the\nmedication cabinet. The parent or guardian will complete all\nrequired admission forms. The DCP will record all relevant\ninformation in the youth’s electronic chart using the\nadmissions form. At the conclusion of the process, the DCP\nwill assign the youth to their designated bed.\n4. Direct Care Professional Classification Criteria at\nAdmission Policy: This policy summarizes how all\nadmissions are completed by Safehaus trained staff.\nDuring the admission process staff are to assess newly\nadmitted youth for health concerns, take vitals, inspect\nyouth’s body for any scars/marks and document areas of\nconcern, collect and maintain medication, generate a\nMedication Administration Record of any prescribed\nauthorized medication, and document diagnoses and\nmedical history in admission notes.\n5. Incident Report dated 4/17/25 authored by Staff 1: The\nincident report aligns with all interviews except for Youth\nA’s statement, in which Youth A reported Staff 1 was not\n6",
    "present to witness the incident. However, Staff 1 reported\nthat she was present for approximately 10 minutes when\nYouth A initially refused to leave the admissions office to\nsee her new room. Staff 1 stated that she then left the\nadmissions office to contact the Chief Administrator about\nnext steps since Youth A was not cooperative. Staff 1 noted\nthat Youth A remained in the office with Foster Care\nSpecialist and Support Staff, and she believed Youth A was\nunder appropriate supervision.\n6. Adverse Incident Procedures: Supervisor on duty should\nbe notified immediately, and an Adverse Incident Report\nform should be completed.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted, Staff 1 did not properly secure Youth A’s medication\nduring the admission process. The facility’s medication storage\npolicy states medications are to be stored in a locked cabinet.\nHowever, Youth A’s medication was left unlocked and unattended,\nwhich led to Youth A ingesting and overdosing on her medication.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n• The facility was informed they must have a place to safely\nsecure medications during the admission process.\n• The facility should update their admission process/policy\nand DCP admission policy to include appropriate\nmedication storage, which should mirror the facility’s\nmedication storage policy.\n• An incident report was not completed the day of the\nincident. The facility was informed they must adhere to their\nown policy and complete an incident report immediately\nfollowing an incident. Incident report was received on\n4/28/25 but dated 4/17/25.\n• The facility should explore more in-depth, frequent, and/or\neffective crisis intervention/management training as Staff 1\nand Staff 2 expressed additional training surrounding crisis\nintervention would be beneficial, as they currently felt\nunprepared.\n• The facility should ensure staff have adequate ways to call\nfor assistance no matter where they are on the facility’s\ngrounds, as Staff 1 reported spending time trying to find a\nsignal so she could call for help during this crisis.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n7",
    "Based on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the current license status be continued.\nJune 10, 2025\nErica Marshall Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 24, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n8"
