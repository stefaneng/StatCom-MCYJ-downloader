There is\nconcern the agency is not providing proper care and\nprogramming to prevent the youth from needing care in the\nemergency department.\nInterviews:\nChief Administrator, Rights Officer, and Quality Manager\nwere contacted on 11/22/24 by email to obtain the names of\nyouth that were seen at a hospital from 11/19/24-11/22/24.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth A reported she attended school daily and had therapy 1-2\ntimes per week. Youth A stated they did not do any activities on\nher unit. After school they relaxed for a while, then had dinner,\nchores, hygiene, and bedtime. Youth A stated there were no\ngroup activities, games, art, or journaling. When asked if activities\nwere limited due to behavior issues, Youth A answered, “yes”.\nYouth A reported when youth behavior was out of control, police\nwould be called. Youth A gave examples of out-of-control\nbehavior as youth fighting and hurting one another, suicidal\nbehavior, self-harming behavior, breaking windows and doors.\nStaff would call for the unit to clear. Additional staff would\nrespond to try to help. Staff tried to stop kids by talking to them,\nremoving objects, separating youth, deescalating, and\nredirecting. If none of that worked, police may be called. Police\nwould then take the youth to the hospital. The hospital usually\n2",
    "just sent them back. Staff always went to the hospital to stay with\nyouth.\nYouth B was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth B reported other than attending school, they did not do\nmuch on her unit. Sometimes they watched television or played\ngames. But there were not many scheduled group activities.\nYouth B stated Journey To Success (JTS) staff used to go to their\nunit all the time. JTS would do group activities and independent\nlivings skills, but that no longer happened. Youth B stated they\nrecently had a lot of downtime. Youth B acknowledged that these\nactivities may not happen because there were always issues on\nher unit. Youth B stated some peers were able to go to another\nunit for events, while others on wing restriction were not allowed\nto participate. Youth B wanted to have more activities such as\nmusic/dance, karaoke, gym/exercise, and arts/crafts. Youth B\nstated police were called to the facility when staff were unable to\ncalm down a youth that was attacking people, harming\nthemselves, swallowing items, or suicidal. Staff would talk with\nkids and try to help them by giving prompts and trying to redirect,\nbefore calling the police to assist. If the police came to campus,\nthey usually took the youth to the hospital for an evaluation. Staff\nalways went to the hospital with youth.\nYouth C was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/25.\nYouth C stated they had school daily and therapy 1-2 times per\nweek. Youth C reported they had activities through JTS, but that\nno longer happened. Staff also tried to have groups daily, but not\neveryone wanted to participate. There were some arts, crafts,\nand games. However, they did not practice in independent living\nskills and did not go outside, or off campus for outings. Youth C\nreported that police would be called to campus if youth were\nescalated, and staff could not calm them down. Youth C stated\nstaff tried to deescalate youth by talking to them and getting them\nto focus on other things. But when they were unsuccessful, the\npolice would pick the youth up and take them to the hospital for\nan evaluation. Usually, the hospital would send the youth right\nback without doing anything. Staff always sat with youth at the\nhospital.\nYouth D was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/6/24.\nYouth D reported their typical day consisted of school, down-time,\ntherapy or other appointments, dinner, activities, phone calls, and\nbedtime. Youth D reported they could not always follow the\nschedule as Youth C was very disruptive and caused problems\nthat pulled staff away from doing activities. Youth D stated that\n3",
    "Youth C attacked people, started fights, and destroyed items on\nthe unit. Staff intervened by talking to youth, redirecting, calling\nthe unit to clear and separating youth. If someone was being very\nviolent, the police may be called. The police sometimes arrive\nand speak to youth and other times they took youth to the\nhospital. If youth went to the hospital, staff followed and stayed\nwith the youth until discharge.\nYouth E was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24\nand 1/17/24. Youth E reported they no longer had activities\nthrough JTS. Youth really enjoyed the JTS program because they\nwould help youth with independent living skills such as cooking.\nYouth E stated they did not have many activities due to two youth\non the wing that always caused problems. Youth E reported they\nwere sometimes able to go to the boutique on campus to shop,\nas a reward. Other youth that were on wing restriction were not\nable to do that. Youth E stated she wanted to go to the gym more\noften, but peers made that difficult. Youth E stated that police\nwere not called to campus that often. Staff would only call if they\nhad tried to work with youth that were very physically aggressive\nbut had been unsuccessful at calming them down. Youth E stated\nthat staff would speak with youth, redirect them and try to get\nthem to focus on something different. If police came to campus,\nthey typically transported the youth to the hospital for an\nevaluation. In Youth E’s experience, the hospital did not take\nyouth seriously and immediately discharged them. Youth E\nrecalled a time that she was sent there for suicidal thoughts.\nYouth E told hospital staff she planned to kill herself and they\nsent her back to the facility without being evaluated. The facility\nput her on an increased supervision plan and took the situation\nmore seriously than the hospital.\nYouth F was interviewed face-to-face on 12/17/24 at the facility.\nYouth F stated she did not like being at the facility as staff were\nalways correcting her and trying to make her do things that she\ndid not feel like doing. Youth F clarified that she meant\nschoolwork, cleaning her room and participating in groups. Youth\nF stated they participated in some activities such as cooking, ‘my\nlife/my choice’, movies, gym time, games, and crafts. Youth F\nstated that she recently worked with a peer to write an essay\nabout other things they should be able to do while at the facility.\nYouth F presented several ideas during the interview. Youth F\nstated they were sometimes unable to do activities when peers\non the unit were acting out and require staff intervention. Youth F\nsaid that staff would talk with youth when they had problems and\ntry to deescalate and redirect them. Police were not often called\n4",
    "to the building, but if they were, it was usually to help transport a\nyouth safely to the hospital when their behavior was out of\ncontrol. After the interview, Rights Officer was informed of Youth\nF’s essay. Rights Officer indicated Youth F may be part of their\nstudent panel to help plan activities.\nYouth G was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nYouth G stated she felt the program was helpful and she did not\nhave any concerns. Youth G stated she participates in several\nactivities every day, including art, dance, games, group work,\nmovies, and reading. Youth G reported she also attended therapy\nweekly. Youth G felt that they had very good staff at the facility.\nYouth G did not have any experience with the police coming to\nthe building or youth going to the hospital.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nStaff 1 stated everything was going well at the facility. Some of\nthe youth had significant behavioral issues that required the use\nof additional staff support. The youth’s therapist or clinical director\nwould be called to the unit to assist as needed. If youth were\nhighly escalated and physically assaulting others, the police may\nbe called to the unit. Police would then transport the youth to the\nhospital for evaluation. Staff would also go to the hospital with\nyouth. Staff 1 stated some of the youth on wing restriction had too\nmuch downtime. The youth needed more group activities and\nbonding activities that would help them connect with one another\nand have fewer issues. Otherwise, their daily schedule typically\nincluded school, phone calls, chores, dinner, and some down\ntime before bed. There was also someone that came in\noccasionally to run group activities.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/17/24.\nStaff 2 stated some youth in the program were bored, due to\nprivileges being taken away for behavior. Staff did the best they\ncould to keep youth busy and provide them with support.\nHowever, not all of the youth wanted to participate or listen to\nstaff. Staff 2 stated when youth acted out, there were not many\nconsequences to discourage them from acting out again later.\nStaff 2 stated youth behavior that warranted intervention included\nattacking staff, attacking one another, breaking items, fighting, or\nattempting to AWOL. Staff 2 stated youth received a lot of\nsupport, but they did not see the big picture, and did not use the\nsupport available to them. Staff 2 did not have any contact with\npolice on campus and has not gone to the hospital with youth.\nHowever, Staff 2’s understanding was that a team leader or\n5",
    "supervisor would call the police for assistance if staff were unable\nto calm a youth and people were being injured.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/24.\nStaff 3 stated a typical day for youth was to get up and take care\nof hygiene before school, then after school they were busy doing\nactivities. Activities include games, arts/crafts, painting,\njournaling, talking, basketball, walks, and group activities. Staff 3\nwas relatively new and had not experienced JTS. Staff 3 stated\nthat they tried to involve all youth, but some do not cooperate and\nrefuse to participate. Some youth behavior also hindered the\nother youth from being able to participate organized activities.\nStaff 3 felt that staff were able to deescalate youth effectively\nthrough conversation and redirection. Staff 3 had not been\ninvolved in any situations that involved the police or hospital.\nHowever, their understanding was that supervisors would contact\nthe police for assistance if a youth was uncontrollably physical\nand harming people, after failed attempts by staff to redirect and\ndeescalate.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/17/24.\nStaff 4 reported the youth had a daily schedule, depending on if it\nwas a school day. After school and on weekends, youth would\npaint/draw, play games, attend group therapy, motivational\nactivities, talk, and complete school activities on their computers\nif needed. Staff 4 stated they believed staff were good at\ndiscussing emotions and working together to make situations\nbetter. Prior to calling the police, staff would talk with the girls, try\nto get them calm, discuss solutions, do activities, do physical\nactivity to work energy out, and try to get them grounded and take\ntheir mind off what they are mad about. The police would only be\ncalled to campus if a youth was physically violent with staff, and\nthey were unsuccessful at deescalating them. A team leader or\nsupervisor would make that decision. The police would come on-\nsite, talk with the youth, and sometimes escort them to the\nhospital. Staff would go to the hospital as well. But youth would\ntypically return to the facility right away.\nChief Administrator contacted DCWL via email on 12/20/24,\noutlining activities planned for youth during their holiday break\nfrom school. Activities included Science Technology Engineering\nMath (STEM) activities, basketball, holiday party, Lego activities,\nmovies, and a content creator workshop.\nRights Officer was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n1/15/25. Rights Officer reported the facility was partnering with\n6",
    "Wayne County Community Mental Health to complete on-site\nscreenings for Wayne MDHHS youth, to determine if they are in\nneed of short-term hospitalization. On 1/21/25 Rights Officer\nclarified via email that JTS was a program within Vista Maria that\norganized events such as groups and dances, where instructors\nwere brought to campus. Recently they had a hair show and a\nfamily movie day for the youth. Dream Realized through\nEducation/Empowerment and Mentoring (DREAM) was a group\nthat was part of JTS that also offers group activities to youth on\ncampus. Heart Warmers was a spiritual group that youth could\nparticipate in on Sundays. Rights Officer confirmed that all of\nthese groups remain active on campus.\nQuality Manager was contacted via email on 1/23/25 regarding\nthe plans to revamp services on campus. Quality Manager\nreported there was a work group developed by the Activities &\nAcademic Support Manager. The work group was reviewing\ncurrent activities and creating new programming activities to\nengage the youth. Previously the facility contracted with outside\npartners for activities. There was also a restructured client\nadvisory board, similar to a student council, to provide youth with\nmore of a voice in decisions that were made. Youth would be\nable to bring any issues, concerns, wishes, requests to the group\nfor discussion and decision making.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager (AASM) was\ncontacted via email on 1/23/25. AASM outlined the following\nitems available to youth on campus: afterschool activities include\nbut are not limited to, expressive therapies such as yoga, dance\nmovement therapy, music therapy, art therapy, physical activity\nand nutritional health education. Academic mentoring and\ntutoring are supported through the DREAM program as it\nconnects each youth with mentors who are successful in their\ncareer paths and provide supports by focusing on their education\nand future career goals. In addition, the activity team provides\nprograming that creates a safe environment to strengthen coping\nskills, promote social connections, and support healthy self-\nesteem and confidence through creative self-care\nstrategies. Lastly, the Transition to Independence Process (TIP)\nmodel, supports the youth in areas of education, employment,\nsocial skills, relationships and health, and life skills.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 1\nwas assigned to Youth C. Therapist 1 reported that youth were\noffered activities such as games, art, gym, dance class, and\ncooking class. Therapist 1 reported that youth may have\n7",
    "indicated that they were not doing as many activities lately, but\nthis was due to some programs being revamped. Some activities\nmay be restricted if the youth was physically aggressive. For\nexample, instead of using colored pencils that may be sharp, a\nyouth could be given crayons to draw. Youth also attended\nindividual and family therapy, and occupational therapy. In\ntherapy they worked on triggers and warning signs, coping skills,\nthinking/feeling, and problem solving. Youth C was receiving\ncognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Youth C engaged in therapy\nand was benefiting from it. Regarding hospitalization and police\ncontact, Therapist 1 reported that youth may be escorted to the\nhospital by police if they had continued escalated physical\naggression, self-harming, or suicidal behavior that staff were\nunable to reduce after multiple attempts to help the youth self-\nregulate. The clinical supervisor and clinical director must make\nthe determination if assistance was to be called. Therapist 1 also\nreported that the facility had begun a partnership with Wayne\nCounty CMH, where CMH staff would complete on-site\nassessments to determine if a youth was eligible for short term\nhospitalization.\nTherapist 2 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 2\nwas assigned to Youth A. Therapist 2 reported that youth at the\nfacility were offered therapy, psychiatrist appointments,\noccupational therapy, DREAM, life skills, leadership skills, and\nafterschool activities such as sports, art, and dance. Youth attend\ntherapy twice per week on a flexible schedule that worked best\nfor the youth. Youth A declined to attend therapy at times, and\nwhen she attended, she was not engaged. Therapist 2 stated that\nYouth A was not interested in working on anything\ntherapeutically. Regarding police and hospital services, youth\nwould be sent to the hospital when there was a suicide attempt or\nAWOL. Youth may also be sent if they were highly aggressive\ntoward others, and staff had been unsuccessful at calming them\ndown. The police may be called to safely escort youth to the\nhospital upon approval by the clinical supervisor and director.\nTherapist 2 noted that the facility was also working with Wayne\nCounty CMH, as they would come on site to complete\nassessments for youth, rather than sending the youth to the\nhospital.\nTherapist 3 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 3\nreported that youth participated in therapy 1-2 times per week,\ndepending on their program. Youth also attended group therapy,\nexpressive therapies, recreational therapy through Journey to\nSuccess (JTS). JTS includes Science Technology Education\n8",
    "Math (STEM) activities, mentoring and educational tutoring.\nYouth also received occupational therapy, psychiatric, medical,\nand family engagement services. While on their unit youth were\nable to play games, participate in art, watch television, and\nparticipate in groups. Regarding police or hospital involvement,\ntheir services might be needed if a youth was highly escalated to\nan extent that it was a safety concern, and they were unable to\nregulate themselves or be deescalated. Sometimes physical\nintervention could be used, but that was not always safe,\nespecially with a youth that was self-harming or physically\naggressive. The unit manager, clinical director or head consulting\npsychiatrist made the determination if youth should be sent to the\nhospital. Therapist 3 stated the facility began working with Wayne\nCounty Community Mental Health to complete assessments at\nthe facility rather than visiting the hospital. Therapist 3 did not\nhave any experience with this service.\nTherapist 4 was interviewed by phone on 1/24/25. Therapist 4\nstated that youth on campus participated in individual therapy,\ngroup work, JTS activities, DREAM program, Alcoholics\nAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, structured activities with\nvolunteer groups, occupational therapy, religious services, and\nreceive support from youth counselors. JTS had pro-social life\nskills, games, yoga, dance, sports and art. DREAM offered life\nskills, vocational training, exercise and mentorship. On the unit,\nyouth were able to participate in art, games, movies, crafts,\nactivities in the courtyard, and go on outings in the community.\nThese activities could be modified at times, due to youth\nbehavioral or safety issues. Therapist 4 stated that youth\nreceived at least one hour of therapy per week, which may be\nbroken up into smaller sessions, depending on the youth.\nRegarding police or hospital involvement, Therapist 4 stated that\npolice may be called to campus if youth had violent behaviors\nand attacked staff or peers. Police would not be called until after\nstaff had made several efforts to deescalate the youth. A\nsupervisor, clinical director and the psychiatrist would determine\nwhen police would be called to campus. Generally, this decision\nwould be made when a youth needed to be evaluated, but staff\ndid not feel they could safely transport the youth. Therapist 4\nstated that she had some experience with the new process of\nhaving Wayne County Community Mental Health complete an\nassessment on-site, in lieu of going to the hospital. The\nassessment was well done and determined the youth needed\ninpatient hospitalization. However, there was not a placement\navailable. The service was helpful, but not as helpful as they\nhoped.\n9",

    "During interviews Youth C reported they do not have\nopportunities to participate in outdoor activities.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager provided\ndocumentation of several indoor activities made available for\nyouth. However, no outdoor activities were identified.\nDuring a call on 2/6/25, Chief Administrator and Quality\nManager reported that youth participate in outdoor activity when\nthe weather permits. However, they were unsure if there was a\nschedule of outdoor activities. They were asked to provide\ndocumentation to show that youth were participating in outdoor\nactivity on a regular basis. In subsequent emails on 2/10/25 and\n2/14/25, Quality Manager reported they did not have any\ndocumentation to verify this request.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nWeekly and monthly unit schedules were reviewed that had\nschedule activities documented such as daily group, daily phone\ncalls, therapy, physical activity, JTS, “Chicktime” with volunteer\ngroup, Vista Maria reads (Book Ladies), Lost Voices Concert,\ntown hall meeting, Boots & Bites with Lace Up Detroit, Pet\nTherapy, holiday events with Abhi Shah Foundation, holiday\ndecorating, and youth health fair.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as youth reported being\nunable to participate in activities due to peer behavior, or not\nhaving any activities available to them while on wing restriction.\nYouth also reported they are not able to engage in outdoor activity\nand the agency did not have any documentation to verify outdoor\nactivities occur with youth.\nCONSULTATION:\nConsultation was offered regarding youth behavior on units that\ndisrupt the daily activities. When disruptive behavior is ongoing\nand prohibiting other youth from their daily activities, efforts should\nbe made to continue activities with youth in another area, away\nfrom the disruption. Not only would this be a positive step for the\nother youth, but it would also take away the acting out youth’s\npower to control the daily activity of the unit. Additionally, for youth\nplaced on restriction that are missing activities, staff should\ncontinue to focus on encouraging the youth to reduce behaviors in\norder to re-join the group. This may help alleviate the youth’s\nfeeling that wing restriction is never ending. Lastly, inclusion of\nideas from some restricted youth in the client advisory board\nwould be a great way to determine some activities that restricted\n15",
