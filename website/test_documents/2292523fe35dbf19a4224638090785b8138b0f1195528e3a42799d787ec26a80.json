    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not in need of consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has submitted no acceptable corrective action plans required not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nDuring the unannounced onsite inspection, I completed a tour of the facility. The\nfacility was well maintained and clean. The youth bedrooms were full of appropriate\nitems, bathrooms were clean, medications were locked, and meal menus were\nposted. Ample food was observed in the house. Random bedroom checks were\ncompleted in varying intervals not to exceed 15 minutes when youth were asleep or\notherwise outside staff line of sight. I completed interviews with staff, who reported\nfeeling supported by management and enjoyment in their employment. Staff are\ntrained in physical management, CPI but have never had to participate in one during\nthe period under review. I interviewed three youth during the onsite visit. The youth\ninterviewed reported feeling safe at Bellaview and stated staff are respectful to them.\nThey liked the program and reported a variety of independent living skill development\nopportunities. All youth were enrolled in school. There were no concerns noted by the\nyouth or staff.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJanuary 27, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 28, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
