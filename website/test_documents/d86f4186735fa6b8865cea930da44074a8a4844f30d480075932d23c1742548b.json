    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nTo expand its foster care services and provide convenience to families, Methodist\nChildren’s Home Society has requested to add a satellite office to its existing office\nin Redford.\nIII. Methodology\nI responded to the Chief Administrator’s request and virtually toured the new office\nspace on July 30, 2020.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe new office space is in a two-story building in north central Detroit located at\n2470 Collingwood St, Detroit, Michigan 48206. The main crossroads are Linwood\nand Davison. Methodist is renting six suites in the building from the City of Detroit\nas part of a renovation project called Durfee Innovation Center, formerly known as\nDetroit Central High School. Methodist shares the building with other\ncompanies/organizations that also rent suites.\nThere is a free gated parking lot open during business hours and locked after\nhours. A security guard stands at the front entrance to the building where visitors\nand patrons must sign in.\nOn the first floor, Suite 122 has six three-sided office cubicles and a locking file\ncabinet for CHRI documents. Suite 124 has three supervisor offices. Suite 114\nhas a large conference room. Suite 110 has four supervisor offices. On the\nsecond floor, Suite 217 has two visiting rooms furnished with couches and a play\narea with toys. Suite 207 has a staff lounge with a refrigerator and microwave.\nThere is Wifi throughout the building. There is no cabinet to store foster child\nrecords. Hard copy files will be maintained at the Redford location and will not be\ntransported to the Detroit office. Family visits will be offered in spaces at both\nlocations.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend this satellite office be added to Methodist’s existing license and\nopened for business.\nAugust 7, 2020\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2"
