    "Allegation Staff pulled youth hair and pushed him and put her arm around his\nneck.\nInvestigation I reviewed intake dated 03/06/2023. It states that on 03/05/2023\nYouth A was being extremely aggressive with escalated\nbehaviors. Youth A stated that Staff Person 1 pulled his hair,\nyanked, and then pushed him. Youth A pushed Staff Person 1\nback and told her not to touch him. Staff Person 1 then allegedly\nput her right arm around Youth A’s neck like she was going to\nchoke him. Youth A does not any injuries and does not report any\npain, discomfort, or headaches. Youth A does not feel safe\naround Staff Person 1.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nI reviewed incident report dated 03/05/2023 at 11:15pm. It reports\nStaff Person 1 extending her arm across the doorframe to prevent\nany residents from leaving the short hallway due to safety of\nanother resident. Youth A continued to attempt to push through\nStaff Person 1 at which point she placed both her arms on Youth\nA’s arms to prevent him from assaulting her and redirected him\nback to the short hallway. Chief Administrator/Complainant does\nnot report any additional allegations.\nI reviewed incident report dated 03/05/2023 at 11:30pm. It reports\nYouth A being overly aggressive upon return from AWOL and\ncoming in and out of his bedroom. Youth A broke the broom and\ndustpan while being verbally aggressive toward staff. Youth A\nengaging with another resident causing disruption on the floor and\nlater Youth A approaching staff, cursing, yelling, and screaming,\nthrowing objects, and threatening staff.\nI reviewed incident report dated 03/05/2023 at 12:00am. It reports\nYouth A going into another resident’s bedroom and taking\nbelongings and being instructed to return the items. Youth A was\ncursing at staff and threw a ball which was retrieved by Staff\nPerson 1. Youth A then began pushing Staff Person 1 as she was\nin a defensive stance to prevent from being assaulted when Staff\nPerson 2 stepped in between, and Staff Person 1 removed herself\nfrom the area and called for assistance. Youth A then punching\nthe walls and doors.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Youth A onsite with DHHS Worker 1, and the case\nmanager for Youth A, DHHS Worker 2 on 03/07/2023. He reports\nbeing mad, though calm, at staff during shift change. He reports\n2",
    "wanting to throw something out and that Staff Person 1 prevented\nhim from walking through the hallway door by extending her arm\nacross it. Staff Person 1 instructed him to go back to his bedroom\nand Youth A reports he went back. Youth A reports going into his\nnext-door neighbor’s bedroom and taking a room deodorizer and\nthen going into another resident’s bedroom. He then states going\ninto his own bedroom and that he came out and dropped a ball.\nHe reports Staff Person 1 picked the ball up and that he then\nattempted to grab her “stuff”. He reports walking toward Staff\nPerson 1 who then extended her arm outward, grabbing his hair\nand pulling it back, and then pushing him with the outside of her\nforearm. Youth A then states that he pushed Staff Person 1 and\nthat she put her arm around his neck and that he broke free and\nwalked into his bedroom. Youth A indicates that Youth B and\npossibly Staff Person 2 saw the incident. It is noted that Youth A\nleft the interview room only to come back minutes later to inform\nthis writer after the incident that he discovered Staff Person 1’s\nfingernail in his hair after the incident.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite with DHHS Worker on 03/07/2023.\nYouth B reports being friends with Youth A from the community\nand before placement. Youth B spoke fragmentedly and did not\nreport his alleged observations in a sequential timeframe. He\nreports Staff Person 1 grabbing Youth A’s hair from the front and\npulling it backwards and then pushing Youth A with the side of her\narm. He reports Staff Person 1 had Youth A’s ball and that he\ntook it from Youth A’s hands. He states Staff Person 1’s\nbelongings were in the long hallway and that he was walking in\nfront of Staff Person 2 from the long hallway onto the short\nhallway. Youth B states that Staff Person 2 informed him that she\ndidn’t see what had occurred.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n03/07/2023. She reports being employed by the facility since\n01/23/2023 and being trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention\n(TCI). She reports at approximately 11:15pm that two staff were\npresent and eight residents, with four residents in the long hallway\nand four in the short hallway. She reports another resident having\nsome issues in the long hallway and that she stood next to the\ndoorway extending her arm across the door opening preventing\nYouth A’s access into the long hallway as he wanted to see what\nwas going on. She reports Youth A pushed her arm and that\nanother resident from the short hallway pulled Youth A back and\nwalked him into his bedroom. Later at approximately 12:00am,\nStaff Person 1 was in the short hallway and observed Youth A\ncoming out of another resident’s bedroom with some of their\n3",
    "belongings. She reports Youth A throwing his ball at her and\nwhen she bent over to pick it up, Youth A walked fast up on her\nwhile swearing at her. Staff Person 1 reports placing herself in a\nprotective stance when Youth A started to push her toward a wall.\nStaff Person 1 states Staff Person 2 stepped in between her and\nYouth A and that she proceeded to move away from Youth A and\nwalk into the long hallway. Staff Person 1 states she was in a\ndefensive stance as taught in TCI when Youth A walked up on her\nand began to push her. She denies grabbing Youth A’s hair and\ndenies placing her arm around his neck as alleged. She reports\nStaff Person 2 was present and assisted in getting her away from\nYouth A and notes that Youth B was also present. Staff Person 1\nstates disappointment that the facility security cameras are not\noperational noting that such evidence would show that she did not\ngrab Youth A’s hair, push, or choke him as he alleges.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n03/09/2023. She reports being employed by the facility since\n01/30/2023 and being trained in TCI. She reports being\npositioned in the short hallway at approximately 11:00pm noting\nthat Youth A had just come back to the facility from being AWOL.\nAnother resident was having an issue in the long hallway, so Staff\nPerson 1 stood in the doorway with her arm extended across it to\nprevent any other residents from entering the area. She reports\nYouth A was attempting to get through the sectioned off door and\nthat he pushed Staff Person 1 and then her. She then reports\nYouth A going into another resident’s bedroom and began\nharassing him, noting that Staff Person 1 directed Youth A out of\nthe bedroom. Youth A began throwing and bouncing a ball\nthroughout the hallway and that Staff Person 1 took the ball. She\nthen reports Youth A began pushing Staff Person 1 who had her\narms up in a protective stance and called for assistance. She\nreports Staff Person 1 was stumbling backwards as Youth A\ncontinued to push her and that Staff Person 2 stepped in between\nthe two to give Staff Person 1 some space to walk away from the\nwall Youth A had her pinned to. Staff Person 2 states Staff\nPerson 1 was in a protective stance as she was being pushed\nbackwards by Youth A and did not report Youth A’s hair being\npulled or him being placed in a headlock as alleged. After Staff\nPerson 1 removed herself from the small hallway, Youth A then\nwent inside his bedroom.\nDHHS Worker reports no findings.\nAnalysis There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Staff Person 1\npulled Youth A’s hair, pushed him, and choked him as alleged.\n4",
    "Youth A returned from being AWOL agitated, was taking things\nfrom other resident’s bedrooms, and instigating other residents,\nwhile speaking aggressively with staff. Youth A began pushing\nStaff Person 1 and she placed herself in a defensive stance as\ntaught in the facility’s behavior management system, Therapeutic\nCrisis Intervention. Staff Person 2 was present and placed herself\nin between Youth A and Staff Person 1 and did not report Youth\nA’s hair being pulled or him being placed in a headlock as alleged.\nYouth B reports Staff Person 2 was walking behind her and that\nshe informed him that she did not observe anything, which is false\nas Staff Person 2 was present and intervened.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n03/29/2023\n______________________________________\nChristopher M Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n04/10/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n5"
