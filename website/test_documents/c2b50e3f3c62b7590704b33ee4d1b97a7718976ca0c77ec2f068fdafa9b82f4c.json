The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except\nfor the following:\nR 400.12306 Application request.\n(4) An agency shall document that the licensee has been\ngiven an application for renewal of the license not less than\n60 calendar days before the expiration date of the license.\nOne of the three current foster home files reviewed indicated the licensee was not\ngiven a application for renewal at least 60 calendar days before the expiration date\nof the license. In this example the license had an expiration date of 09/02/20 and\nthe letter that was sent with the application for renewal was dated 08/04/20. The\nlicense was subsequently renewed timely.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the reevaluation.\nThe placement specifications shall include all of the following:\n(a) Age,\n(b) Gender,\n(c) Race,\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family,\n(e) Characteristics of children best served by the home,\n(f) Children who may not be placed in the home. The child's\nracial, ethnic, and cultural identity, heritage, and background\nmay only be considered if an assessment of the individual child\nindicates that such consideration is in the best interests of the\nchild.\nOne of the three current foster home files reviewed contained an annual\nreevaluation report dated 05/26/2021 that did not identify the placement\nspecifications as required by this rule. In this example the worker included a\nstatement that the recommendation was for no change in the license instead of\nidentifying the specifications.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of the\nfollowing information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers. If children are\ninterviewed, their last names shall not be included in the report.\n3",

The intake dates of\nthese special evaluations were 04/07/21 and 04/25/21 respectively.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(b) Inform the foster parent, in writing, that he or she has a\nright to have his or her written response included as an\nattachment to the report required by subrule (5) of this rule.\nTwo of the three special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation the\nfoster parent was informed in writing that they had a right to have their written\nresponse included as an attachment to the report. The intake dates of these special\nevaluations were 04/07/21 and 04/25/21 respectively. This is a repeat\nnoncompliance from the renewal evaluation completed 03/10/2020.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(c) Provide a copy of the report to any social services worker\nthat has children placed in the home.\nTwo of the three special evaluations reviewed did not include documentation the\nsocial service worker with children placed in the home was provided a copy of the\nspecial evaluation report. These were the same two reports previously identified.\nThis is a repeat noncompliance from the renewal evaluation completed\n03/10/2020.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the\nfollowing:\n3.)

Areas identified in noncompliance as a part of that evaluation were R\n400.1212 (3)(a), R 400.12324 (4)(b)(d), R 400.12326 (1)(c)(d)(h), and R 400.12327\n(6)(b)(c). Areas identified as repeat noncompliance as a part of this interim\nevaluation are R 400.12327 (6)(b)(c).\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n07/23/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
