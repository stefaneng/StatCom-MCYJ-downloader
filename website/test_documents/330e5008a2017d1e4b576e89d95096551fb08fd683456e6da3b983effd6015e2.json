    "ALLEGATION:\nParent is not being given the opportunity to make medical decisions for youth in care\nas required.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Mother 1 by telephone on 12/02/2021. During the interview Mother 1\nreported she did not think the agency was keeping the parents involved and\ninformed regarding any medical circumstances with the children including the\nobtaining of immunizations as determined by Mother 1’s understanding of court\norders. Mother 1 stated the parents were to be informed of any medical\nappointments prior to the appointment so that the parents could participate/be\nincluded in the appointment.\nI reviewed the court order dated 09/16/2021. This order stated the parents were to\nhave full access to the children’s mental and physical medical appointments and be\ninformed of dates and times at least 48 hours before the appointment except for\nemergencies.\nI interviewed Staff 1 and Administrator 1 remotely on 01/19/2022. Staff 1 stated\nthere were times when the children were taken for care for emergent circumstances,\nand it was not possible to contact the parents in advance. Staff 1 stated there were\nalso situations when the doctor’s office or walk in clinic would only allow the current\ncaregiver to go back with the child since the current caretaker would be the best\nsource to know why the child was brought for treatment.\nA review of the Medical Passport in the MISACWIS system did not include\ndocumentation that Mother 1 was informed of all medical appointments. This was\ndetermined through the lack of documentation and absence of parental signatures of\nMother 1.\nMy review of the text messages provided by Staff 1 included a number of texts\nassociated with the issue of medical care, treatments, and immunizations. A\nnumber of texts reflected Mother 1’s dissatisfaction with being informed about\nmedical care and immunizations after the fact, rather than having the opportunity to\ndetermine the medical care provided.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 801-01 HEALTH REQUIREMENTS\nCaseworker Role\nAt all times, while the child remains under court wardship\nand MDHHS supervision, regardless of placement setting,\nthe caseworker must assess and document the child’s\ncurrent health status.

Assist parent/legal\nguardian with resolving barriers and challenges arising\nfrom child's health needs.\n• Document medical, dental, developmental, and mental\nhealth conditions, appointments, services and treatment\nin case service plans, medical passport and within the\nHealth Profile section of Michigan Statewide Automated\nChild Welfare Information System (MiSACWIS).\nANALYSIS: Documentation, or lack thereof, along with text messages from\nindicate Mother 1 was not actively engaged and supported in\nattending and participating in the medical care of her children\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nStaff 1 was not maintaining adequate communication with the parents to facilitate\nscheduling of parenting time.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Mother 1 by telephone on 12/2/2021. Mother 1 reported there had\nbeen initial problems with scheduling parenting time with her children in placement\n4",
    "following their initial placement on 09/09/2021. Mother 1 stated parenting time is\ncurrently being scheduled and any previous loss of parenting time has been made\nup. Mother 1 reported part of the issue affecting parenting time was the need to do\nsome of time remotely through video calls and dealing with technology issues and\ncoordinating activities associated with the parties involved.\nI interviewed Staff 1 and Administrator 1 remotely on 01/19/2022. Staff 1 stated the\nparents were able to have any loss in parenting time made up. Staff 1 described the\nparents as difficult to work with at times, but the parents maintained involvement in\nthe process and the children were recently returned to the parental home on\n01/13/2022.\nStaff 1 submitted text messages between herself and Mother 1 that occurred in\naddition to the other social work contacts that were available for review in\nMISACWIS. The children were in care from 09/09/2021 to 01/13/2022 which is a\ntotal of 126 days and there were in excess of 151 text messages between Staff 1\nand the parents.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12421 Visitation and parenting time.\nAn agency shall have a policy regarding visitation and\nparenting time that contains, at a minimum, all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) Provisions for visits between parents and children\nexcept where parental rights have been terminated or\nwhen there is a court determination that visits are\ndetrimental to the child.\nANALYSIS: There were barriers in coordinating visitation services, but the\nagency was cooperative with the parents to make up any\nvisitation that was not able to be completed due to emergent\ncircumstances. Mother 1 confirmed at the time of my interview\nthat any missed parenting times had been made up.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06H CASE CONTACTS\nTelephone Contacts\nThe caseworker must have two telephone contacts with the\nlegal parent or guardian in the first month after initial\nplacement and telephone contact as needed in each\nsubsequent calendar month, if the legal parent or guardian\nhas a telephone.\nNote: Telephone contact includes text messaging, instant\nmessaging, and video conferencing.\nANALYSIS: There was extensive contact/communication between Staff 1\nand the parents of the children in care, verified through\ninterviews and review of text messages.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe children were returned to the parental home on 01/13/2022. My review of the\nMISACWIS information system at the time of this investigation did not locate the\nrequired information to document this change in placement as required by R\n400.12405.\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(5) If an agency is no longer providing services to the child\nin a foster home, then both of the following shall be\ndocumented before a change in placement:\n(a) A summary of the services provided during care up\nto the time of the change in placement and the needs\nthat remain to be met.\n(b) Provision for any continuing services.\nANALYSIS: The children were returned to the parental home on 01/13/2022.\nMy review of the MISACWIS information system at the time of\nthis investigation did not locate the required information to\ndocument this change in placement as required.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nMy review of the MISACWIS information system at the time of this investigation\nindicated the Updated Service Plan that was due 01/06/2022 was marked as being\nIn Progress indicating it was not completed timely. It was also noted that\nParent/Agency agreements were not signed by the parents indicating their level of\nparticipation/agreement in the identification of needs and services to meet the needs\nof the family. At the time of my interview with Staff 1 and Administrator 1 they\nreported the parents were not cooperative/willing to sign as they disagreed with the\nplan and would not sign the document even though there is an opportunity for the\nparents to note that disagreement and still sign the document.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each\nchild and parent or parents, as follows:\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and\nat least once every 90 calendar days thereafter.\nANALYSIS: The Updated Service Plan due 01/06/2022 was not completed\ntimely as noted above. The Parent/Agency Treatment plans\nlacked any parental signatures or notations as to why the\nsignatures were not provided/included.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS\nINVESTIGATION:\nA review of the Medical Passport in the MISACWIS system did not include\ndocumentation that Mother 1 was informed of all medical appointments. This was\ndetermined through the lack of documentation and absence of parental signatures of\nMother 1. The information on the medical passport did not contain updated medical\ninformation and was lacking signatures as required.\nMy review of the text messages provided by Staff 1 included a number of texts\nassociated with the issue of medical care, treatments, and immunizations. A\nnumber of texts reflected Mother 1’s dissatisfaction with being informed about\nmedical care and immunizations after the fact, rather than having the opportunity to\ndetermine the medical care provided.\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nDHHS Policy Medical Passport Maintenance\nFOM-801\nAn updated medical passport is provided to:\n• Legal parents, if the child is a temporary court ward.\n- Quarterly.\n- At reunification.\nANALYSIS: A review of the Medical Passport information indicated the\ninformation was not current with all of the medical care that was\nreported to be provided. The Medical Passport also did not\nhave signatures of parents or third-party caregivers to indicate\ntheir receipt of the information.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
