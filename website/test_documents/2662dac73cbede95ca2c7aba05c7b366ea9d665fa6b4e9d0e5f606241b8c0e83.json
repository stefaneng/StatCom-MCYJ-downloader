LW stated she was the assigned licensing\nworker for Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 at the time Youth\nA was placed in their home. LW stated there was no conversation\nregarding Foster Parent 1(FP1) and Foster Parent 2(FP2) ending\nplacement with Youth A without providing 14 days’ notice.\nLicensing supervisor (LS) was interviewed on November 8,\n2023, via telephone. LS stated she was not directly assigned at\nthe time Youth A’s placement with FP1 and FP2 ended however\nthe stance the agency takes is when foster parents report they do\nnot feel safe it is not questioned. LS stated that based on\nlanguage in the TA manual it outlines foster parents may request\nyouth be moved more quickly if their presence in the home\njeopardizes the safety of the youth or members of the household.\nShe stated FP1 and FP2 were adamant they did not feel safe in\nthe home. Upon Youth A’s removal from the home, he was placed\nin inpatient hospital.\nFoster Parent 1 (FP1) and Foster Parent 2 (FP2) were\ninterviewed together on November 15, 2023, via telephone.\nFP2 stated the service needs the family was willing to consider\nlisted in the licensing home study (3130) was accurate. However,\ntheir concern was they were not made aware of all of Youth A’s\ndiagnosis prior to him being placed in their home. She further\nexplained they were not able to provide the required 14-day notice\nto the agency due to an emergency situation where they were not\nreceiving appropriate responses from professionals involved with\nYouth A and, as a result, felt unsafe to continue the placement.\n2",
    "Licensing supervisor 2 (LS2) was interviewed on November\n21, 2023, via telephone. She stated she has been the assigned\nlicensing supervisor since just after FP1 and FP2 became\nlicensed in May 2023. LS2 stated Youth A’s assigned caseworker\ncontacted the agency via the emergency after hours phone and\nreported Youth A had been taken to the hospital by FP1 and FP2\nand he would not be placed back in their care upon discharge due\nto Youth A’s behaviors in the home and concern for their safety.\nShe stated the agency’s stance when a foster parent report they\ndo not feel safe they will not continue with the placement.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Youth A’s placement record while placed with FP1 and FP2\nincluded a documented timeline while he was in their care\nfrom October 2, 2023-October 10, 2023. The timeline\nstates Youth A’s behavior escalated on October 9, 2023,\nand into October 10, 2023. He started to make verbal\nthreats to run away and injure himself, he began yelling at\nFP1 and FP2, and was followed by threats to physically\ninjure FP1.\n• Youth A’s MISACWIS case record. Social work contact\ndated October 10, 2023, at 10:46am includes a text\nmessage sent from FP1 to Youth A’s assigned case worker\nthat reads: “WE DO NOT FEEL SAFE WITH HIM IN OUR\nHOME!!! If I need to get an attorney, I will. He threatened\nme as we left the house. Said if we were going somewhere\nhe didn’t like he was going to start swinging at me. Plus\nwith the social worker’s recommendations, we do not feel\nsafe!!!”\n• Youth A’s placement record documents he was in inpatient\nhospital placement from October 10, 2023-October 25,\n2023.\n• Social work contact dated October 19, 2023, at 10:45 am.\nYouth A continues to meet criteria for inpatient\nhospitalization.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as there is documentation\nwithin Youth A’s MISACWIS case record that FP1 and FP2\nreported to the assigned caseworker they no longer felt safe while\nhe was placed in their home. In addition, interviews with LS and\nLS2 verify the agency did not initiate a special evaluation based\non the foster parents reporting they did not feel safe to continue\nplacement.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325 License recommendation\nSection (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the appropriate\nDescription licensing action consistent with facts contained in the foster\nhome evaluation and any special evaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Orchards Children’s Services placed an intensive needs child into\na new foster home open less than six months.

She stated the agency did not have case\nmanagement responsibility for Youth A’s case, but their agency\nwas contacted for placement purposes. The intake worker\nreceived an email from the Intensive Placement Unit looking for\nplacement for Youth A and she contacted FP1 and FP2.\nLicensing supervisor (LS) was interviewed on November 8,\n2023, via telephone. She stated the initial home study was\nstarted by another worker in her office, but she conducted the\nhome visit with FP1 and FP2 and completed the report. She\nacknowledged the family did not have a lot of specific training\nregarding some of the service types they were approved for but\nstated the family was adamant that they had connections in their\ncommunity that are part of the mental health field. In addition,\nFP1’s adult daughter had a lot of past mental health needs. As a\nresult, the family conveyed they felt prepared to adequately\nhandle the specific service needs identified in the initial home\nstudy. LS stated she uses a variety of information when assessing\nthe service needs that foster parents are approved for. She stated\nshe takes into account the information provided during GROW\ntraining, personal experience, or outside training experiences. She\nstated she also assesses based on conversation with the family to\ngage their ability to care for youth with certain service needs.\nLS stated FP1 and FP2 had also expressed interest in training\nopportunities that were specific to the service types they were\napproved for.

At that point, IW\nconnected FP2 with training staff within the agency. Intensive\nPlacement Unit contacted IW regarding Youth A. She stated they\nsent her his write up, his MARE video and indicated he had made\na lot of progress and ready for a community setting. In general,\nupon receiving placement inquiry emails, IW will reach out to\nfoster parents that have an opening and explain the information\nthat was provided to her. Generally, the placement write up does\nnot have a lot of information. She will reach out to the assigned\nfoster care worker if more information is needed, or prospective\nfoster parents have any questions. Once the foster parents and\nfoster care worker connect, she allows the assigned worker to\nprovide additional information or answer specific questions about\na youth.\nFoster Parent 1 (FP1) and Foster Parent 2 (FP2) were\ninterviewed together on November 15, 2023, via telephone.\nFP2 stated the service needs the family was willing to consider\nlisted in the 3130 was accurate.

FP2 stated they\nwere initially contacted by IW regarding Youth A and a few other\nyouth inquiring about possible placement. She stated IW was\nfamiliar with the service needs the family was willing to consider\nand not willing to consider. Regarding Youth A, IW described his\nprofile and stated she did not see any concerns based on the\n5",
    "information she had, and the service needs they were willing to\naccept. IW connected FP1 and FP2 with Youth A’s assigned\nfoster care worker. FP1 stated he reported to the agency his now\nadult daughter was diagnosed with ADHD and based on that he\nfelt comfortable caring for a child with that diagnosis.

He truly has made SIGNIFICANT progress during\nthis admission at Hawthorn Center. He was admitted in\nSeptember 2020 and cleared for discharge on November\n16, 2022. Unfortunately, the residential facilities have\nprobably labeled him in a negative light and are not willing\nto give him a chance. It will take a very specific trauma-\ninformed foster home to take him on. The psychologist at\nHawthorn Center has informed us that she would be willing\nto work with a prospective placement to learn his triggers\nand to learn strategies to be successful with him as he has\nexperienced so much trauma and loss in his 12 years of\nlife”. Attachments to the email include a 1.5-page treatment\nupdate and recommendation summary from Hawthorn\nCenter that lists current diagnoses and medication. Other\nrecommendations state, in part, caregivers should receive\npsychoeducation on the impact of trauma and prenatal\nsubstance exposure on children.
