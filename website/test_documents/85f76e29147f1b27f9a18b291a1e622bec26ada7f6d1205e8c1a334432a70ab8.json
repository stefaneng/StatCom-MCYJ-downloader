    "Allegation Youth A is currently taking Vyvanse, and they increased her\ndosage without consent.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI left a voicemail for Complainant on 3/19/25 and 4/2/25. I have\nnot received a return call.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n3/19/25. Administrator reported all guardians sign a document at\nintake allowing the agency to change dosage of medications\nthroughout the youth’s stay. Administrator reported Youth A’s\nmedication has not changed since intake.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/2/25.\nYouth A reported she takes Vyvanse. Youth A reported she went\nto her most recent medication review and asked for increase in\nVyvanse dosage. Youth A reported her psychiatrist completed\nthis.\nTherapist was interviewed via telephone on 4/7/25. Therapist\nreported she is not a part of changing medication. Therapist\nreported they have consent forms for all youth that are on\nmedication that allows them to administer medication and change\ndosage of their current medications. Therapist reported if the\nagency changes their medication, then a new consent form would\nneed to be completed.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the Psychotropic Medication Informed Consent\ndocument. It was signed on 10/1/24 by Parent. Vyvanse is\nlisted as a medication. The form does state new consent\nwill be completed if a new medication is prescribed.\n• I reviewed the Psychiatric Care Policy. The psychiatrist is\npermitted to change dosage and medications, and written\nconsent will be gathered before medication is dispensed.\n• I reviewed the “Psychiatric Follow Up Note” dated 3/7/25.\nVyvanse was increased from 30mg to 40mg.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. The agency has a consent\nform signed by Parent and the medication Vyvanse is listed as a\ncurrent and approved medication. The agency policy and consent\nform both document that medication changes will require new\nconsent forms but not dosage change.\n3",
    "CONSULTATION:\nThe agency may want to add on their Psychotropic Medication\nInformed Consent form a statement that clearly states, “dosages\ncan be changed.” Not all guardians may be able to distinguish\nbetween medication and dosage changes.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(b) Denial of any essential program service as punishment.\nThese include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(ii) Family time or any type of communications with family.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Therapist is threatening to remove Youth A's home pass if she is\ntoo emotional on her home pass. Therapist is threatening Youth A\nthat she will not be able to talk to Parent.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI left a voicemail for Complainant on 3/19/25 and 4/2/25. I have\nnot received a return call.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face on 3/19/25. She\nreported they do not discipline children by taking away home\nvisits. It is expected children will have emotions on their home\nvisits. Administrator reported Youth A had her first 12-day home\npass on 3/15/25. She was supposed to return on 3/15/25 at\n8:00pm, but didn’t return until 3/16/25. Youth A had reported to\nher upon return that she was anxious while at home. Due to this\nParent told her, because of her anxiety she needed to go to a\ncrisis center. Administrator reported she did not tell Youth A she\ncouldn’t go home again because of this. Administrator reported\nYouth A’s worker dictates the home passes.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/2/25.\nYouth A reported she went on her first home pass on 3/15/25.\nYouth A reported she went to a crisis center that evening, then\nwent home with her mother. The following day they went back to\nthe crisis center around 11am and then went to the agency. Youth\nA reported she has never been told by anyone at the facility\nincluding Therapist that she would lose her home passes if she\n4",
    "showed too much emotion. Youth A reported she was very\nanxious on her first home pass and was thinking that these things\ncould happen. Youth A reported Therapist never stated she\ncouldn’t talk to Parent. Youth A reported Therapist had a\nconversation with her and Parent concerning communication while\nat the facility. Parent had told Youth A her dog passed away on a\nphone call and Therapist told Parent these topics should be\ndiscussed with her before spoken on a phone so support can be\nprovided.\nTherapist was interviewed via telephone on 4/7/25. Therapist\nreported she has never told Youth A that her home passes would\nbe taken from her if she showed too many emotions. Therapist\nreported she has spoken to Parent on different occasions\nconcerning phone calls. Therapist reported she went over that all\nmajor topics should be discussed with Therapist before spoken to\nYouth A on the phone so that if any type of support is needed for\nYouth A, she will be there to help her though it. Therapist reported\nParent has told Youth A over the phone things that has caused\nanxiety in Youth A. Therapist noted these conversations included\nan abusive individual living in their home and Youth A needing to\nfind a different place to live when she leaves placement. Therapist\nreported Parent told Youth A that her dog died. This was another\nincident where Parent should have spoken to her first, so they are\nnot caught off guard. Therapist reported she had a phone call after\nthis with Youth A and Parent on the phone stating the importance\nof talking to her before announcing these things to Youth A.\nTherapist never stated she was not going to let Parent talk to\nYouth A.\nAnalysis The agency is compliant with this rule. Youth A reported Therapist\nnever told her she wouldn’t be able to go home. She\nacknowledged these were her anxieties.
