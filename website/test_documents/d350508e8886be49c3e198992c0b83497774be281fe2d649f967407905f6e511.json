Prior, Youth A was placed with an unlicensed\nrelative from 10/17/22 – 3/13/23. It is noted that the unrelated\nrelative transported Youth A to Foster Parent 1’s home for\nplacement on 3/13/2023. The unrelated relative provided no\ndocuments to Foster Parent 1.\nFoster Parent 1 was interviewed on 7/25/2023, via telephone.\nFoster Parent 1 reported that Youth A’s Unlicensed relative (Sister)\npulled up in her driveway on 3/13/23 and dropped all of Youth A’s\nbelonging in her driveway. She said the sister told her that Youth A\nwas a fine kid. She said she assisted Youth A with his belongings\nand went inside the home where she explains her house rules to\nYouth A.
