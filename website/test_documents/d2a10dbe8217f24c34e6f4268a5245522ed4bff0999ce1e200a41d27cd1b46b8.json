INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12326 Borrowed home.\nSection (1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by another\nDescription agency the borrowing agency shall have a record containing all\nthe following:\n1",
    "(a) Approval from the certifying agency authorizing the placement\nof a child in the home.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency placed a child in the licensed home of another agency\nwithout that other agency's prior knowledge or consent.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 2/3/2025 I interviewed Complainant by telephone.\nComplainant confirmed the information in the complaint.\nComplainant reported their agency, Agency N, who Foster Parent\n1 is licensed through, learned of Youth A’s placement in Foster\nParent 1’s foster home inadvertently on 1/29/2025, when looking\ninto another matter. Complainant saw that Youth A appeared to\nhave been placed in Foster Parent 1’s home on 1/2/2025.\nComplainant attempted to verify the placement via Holy Cross’s\nlicensing department, who was unaware of the placement being\nmade prior. Complainant reported after emails to Holy Cross; and\ncontacts with Youth A’s prior foster parent, Foster Parent 2, and\nFoster Care Supervisor the circumstances as to how Youth A’s\nplacement with Foster Parent 1 came to be was revealed.\nComplainant reported Foster Parent 2 was closing out her license\non 1/3/2025 and Holy Cross was scrambling to replace Youth A.\nSince Youth A’s sister was already placed with Foster Parent 1,\nand Youth A had been having visitations with her sister, Holy\nCross placed Youth A into Foster Parent 1’s home. As to why\nHoly Cross failed to inform Agency N, Complainant reported\nFoster Care Supervisor was apologetic in his explanation,\nreported it was an oversight, that he forgot.\nComplainant reported Holy Cross’s actions of placing Youth A into\nFoster Parent 1’s foster home caused Foster Parent 1 to be out of\nher placement capacity which is for two children as Youth A is the\nthird child in the home. Complainant reported Agency N had to\nsearch this matter out as opposed to Holy Cross contacting\nAgency N to explain their situation and pursue a borrowed bed\nagreement. Complainant reported Agency N is still open to\ncompleting a borrowed bed agreement with Holy Cross. Foster\nParent 1 does have the space and capability to accommodate\nanother child, so Agency N can change Foster Parent 1’s\nlicensing terms, but Holy Cross should have asked Agency N first\nbefore it acted with Youth A’s placement.\nChief Administrator (CA)\n2",
    "I had email contact with CA on 2/3/2025. CA reported being\naware of the circumstances surrounding the complaint.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 2/7/2025 I interviewed FCW by telephone. FCW reported she\nwas Youth A’s Gaylord Worker prior to Youth A’s case transferring\nto Holy Cross’s Muskegon Office just recently. She reported\nbeing on vacation when Youth A’s placement occurred. She\nreported prior to her going on vacation at the end of December\n2024 Foster Parent 2 was indicating since her license was\nexpiring soon, that if Youth A did not want to be placed with them\nanymore there was no sense for them to renew their license.\nFCW said when she returned from vacation on 1/3/2025, Youth A\nwas already placed with Foster Parent 1. Foster Care Supervisor\n(FCS) facilitated the placement; and FCS told her about the\nsituation. FCW reported Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 sort\nof maneuvered the placement. The two foster homes decided they\nwere comfortable with Youth A staying with Foster Parent 1\nbecause Youth A was already visiting with her sibling, who is\nplaced in Foster Parent 1’s home.\nFCW reported after her return she did not contact Foster Parent\n1’s licensing agency about Youth A’s placement change because\nshe did not know who was Foster Parent 1’s licensing agency.\nShe did not contact Holy Cross’s licensing department because\nFCS was the person who had worked on Youth A’s placement.\nFCW reported she was involved in the TDM/FTM/ (Team Decision\nMeeting/Family team meeting) related to Youth A’s placement\nchange which occurred on 1/17/2025.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 2/7/2025, I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS confirmed the\nallegation and information as reported by Complainant and FCW.\nFCS said Foster Parent 1 called him over the holiday and he\nspoke with her on 1/2/2025. Foster Parent 1 told him that Foster\nParent 2’s license was getting ready to expire, Foster Parent 2 did\nnot wish to renew their license, and Youth A was visiting with her.\nHe reported he had not heard about Foster Parent 2 not wanting\nto renew. He confirmed with Foster Parent 2 on 1/2/2025 and\nFoster Parent 2 reported, “ you know you all need to find a new\nplacement for her”. FCS reported at that point the agency needed\nto replace Youth A and since Youth A was already at Foster\nParent 1’s home, and Foster Parent 1 was open to caring for\nYouth A he pursued the placement. He said he was concerned\nwith where Youth A was going and was trying to get Youth A\nplaced. He said, “I just forgot to send a notification to a couple of\n3",
    "people; my licensing team” and Agency N. He reported the matter\nhad been rectified and there is now a borrowed bed agreement in\nplace for Youth A with Agency N.\nReviewed\nYouth A’s MISACWIS record which showed:\n• A Holy Cross letter of placement showing Youth A (age 14)\nwas placed with Foster Parent 1 on 1/2/2025.\n• Youth A was previously placed in Foster Parent 2’s home\nfrom 1/19/2024-1/2/2025.\nFoster Parent 1’s CWLM record which showed:\n• Foster Parent 1 was licensed by Agency N in February\n2024.\n• Foster Parent 1’s licensing terms with respect to capacity\nwas changed from 2 to 3 on 2/5/2025 so that she could\naccommodate placement of a sibling.\n• Youth A’s placement with Foster Parent 1 was listed as\n2/5/2025.\n• The file did not contain a borrowed bed agreement\npertaining to Youth A’s 1/2/2025 placement with Foster\nParent 1 prior to 1/2/2025.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed the agency placed Youth A in Agency N’s licensed foster\nhome of Foster Parent 1 without Agency N’s knowledge or an\napproved borrowed bed agreement with Agency N.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan,\nit is recommended that the current license status be continued.\nMarch 5, 2025\n____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\n4",
