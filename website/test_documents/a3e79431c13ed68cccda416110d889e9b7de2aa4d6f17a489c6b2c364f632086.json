    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(1) An agency shall conduct an annual on-site visit and\ncomplete a written reevaluation of a foster home.\nThree of three open foster home files reviewed which required a renewal home\nstudy during this period under review (PUR) did not have a complete written\nreevaluation of the foster home. All three reports did not provide information on\nwhen the emergency procedures were conducted as required and two reports did\nnot provide specific information on the location of the ammunition in the home. One\nreport does not provide specific information about safety equipment for a hot tub and\nonly references this equipment as “available if needed”. One report states that the\nfoster child reported that the caregiver gives her “whopping”, but it is never followed\nup on within the report.\nThis is a repeat citation from the 2019 annual licensing inspection for which a\nCAP was approved on 8/30/2019.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make a\nlicensing recommendation to the department at least 15\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the foster home\nlicense.\nTwo of three open foster home files reviewed and requiring a renewal home study\nduring this PUR did not have documentation that the home study report was\nprovided to the department at least 15 days prior to the license expiring. The first\nrenewal report was completed one day prior to the license expiring and the second\nrenewal report was completed eleven days prior to the license expiring.\nThis is a repeat citation from the 2019 annual licensing inspection for which a\nCAP was approved on 8/30/2019.\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nappropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained in\nthe foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\n4",
    "Three of three open foster care home files reviewed had a recommendation for\nrenewal even though the renewal report was incomplete and because the report was\nincomplete, the homes were not in compliance. This involved the lack of quarterly\nemergency procedures documented and not addressing the foster child’s report of\nwhopping.\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home.\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by another\nagency or tribe, the agency shall have a record containing all of\nthe following documents:\n(a) Prior approval from the certifying agency authorizing the\nplacement of a child in the home.\nOne of three Borrowed home files reviewed did not have documentation that an\nagreement was reached prior to placement of the child in the home. The child was\nplaced on 3/6/20 and the agreement was documented as occurring on 3/13/20.\nThis is a repeat citation from the 2019 annual licensing inspection for which a\nCAP was approved on 8/30/2019, 2018 licensing renewal inspection for which\na CAP was approved on 8/18/2018 and the 2017 licensing interim inspection\nreport with an approved CAP dated 7/21/2017.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in the\nagency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(c) Conduct a thorough investigation including all necessary\ncollateral contacts.\nOne of two Special Evaluations reviewed during this PUR did not have a thorough\ninvestigation documented in the Special Evaluation Report (SER). This report\ndocumented for the second time that the child reported receiving “whopping” from\nthe caregiver. Documentation shows that there was very little follow up during the\ninvestigation other than to document that the caregiver reported not “whopping” the\nchild. The home was found in compliance just on the word of the caregiver with no\nfurther collateral contacts.\nR 400.12502 Program statement.\n(2) An agency shall give a copy of the program statement to a\nyouth before placement in independent living.\n5",
    "Three of three Independent Living case files reviewed did not have documentation\nthat the agency provided a copy of their program statement to the youth.\nR 400.12503 Policy and procedures.\n(3) An agency shall provide a youth in independent living with a\ncopy of the agency's policies and procedures required by this\nrule.\nThree of three Independent Living case files reviewed did not have documentation\nthat the agency provided a copy of their policy and procedures to the youth.\nR 400.12504 Eligibility requirements.\n(1) An agency shall document the rationale for selection of\nindependent living as the most appropriate placement for the\nyouth.\nTwo of three Independent Living case files reviewed did not have documentation of\nthe agency documenting the rational for the selection of Independent Living as the\nmost appropriate placement for the youth.\nR 400.12507 Medical/dental and mental health care.\n(1) An agency shall ensure that a youth in independent living\nreceives any needed medical, dental, and mental health care as\nrequired in R 400.12413. Medical, dental, and mental health\ncare provided shall be documented in the youth's record.\nOne of three Independent Living case files reviewed did not have documentation\nthat the youth’s medical/dental and mental health care was being provided as\nrequired. This involved the following: last medical exam is documented as taking\nplace on 10/11/18 with a routine illness on 10/19/18, dental is documented as taking\nplace on 1/22/19 and the 1295 for June 2019 states “needs well child exam” but no\ndocumentation this was completed. This youth is on Psychotropic medication and\nthe only medical passports present during this PUR occurred on 12/18/19 to 1/29/20.\nR 400.12510 Independent living contract.\n(1) There shall be a mutually agreed upon contract between the\nyouth and the agency specifying all of the following:\n(a) The responsibilities of the agency and the youth.\n6",
    "Two of three Independent Living case files reviewed did not have documentation of\nthe Independent Living Contract being developed as required.\nR 400.12510 Independent living contract.\n(2) The agreement shall be signed and dated by the youth and\nthe social service worker. The contract shall be reviewed and\nupdated at least once every 90 calendar days and a copy\nprovided to the youth.\nOne of three Independent Living case files reviewed did not have documentation of\nthe Independent Living Contract being updated every 90-calandar days.\nR 400.12605 Adoptive family evaluation.\n(1) An agency social service worker shall complete a written\nadoptive evaluation within 90 days of the family signing an\nadoption application and prior to approving a family for adoption.\n(3) The report shall be an assessment of all of the following:\n(d) Three current references from persons not related to the\napplicants. There shall be an evaluation of any negative\nreferences.\nOne of three Adoptive family evaluation case files reviewed was missing the\nsignature and date of one of the three required references.\nR 400.12505 Supervision\n(1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in independent\nliving consistent with the youth's need for supervision, as required\nby R 400.12504(2) (e).\n(b) At monthly intervals, ensure that the youth is complying with the\nterms of the contract required by R 400.125010, continues to\nreside in a safe and acceptable environment, and is managing\nexpenditures\nTwo of three open independent living case files reviewed did not have\ndocumentation of the DHHS-1295 being completed for each home visit.\nThis is a repeat citation from the 2019 annual licensing inspection for which a\nCAP was approved on 8/30/2019.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there\nare additional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.

Both PERs were documented as “still in progress”.\nThis is a repeat citation from the 2019 annual licensing inspection for which a\nCAP was approved on 8/30/2019 and the 2018 licensing renewal inspection for\nwhich a CAP was approved on 8/18/2018.\nDHHS Policy - Supervisory Approval USP\nFOM 722-09 -\nPage 27\nThe caseworker’s supervisor must review, approve, and sign\nthe updated service plan within fourteen days, after a face to\nface meeting with the caseworker.\nOne of three Open foster care case files reviewed did not have the supervisory\napproval completed within the required 14-day time limit.
