    "verification or prior to the expiration of the\ncurrent verification.\nOne of fourteen new employees did not have a TB test completed prior to hire.\nCCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written\nhealth service policies and procedures\naddressing all of the following:\n(d) Storage of medications.\nDuring the on-site visit at the facility on 3/11/24, the medication cart was not\nlocked per facility policy.

One employee was hired on 6/22/22 and never completed\nthe full CPI training. He completed a blended refresher CPI training on 11/2/23,\nwhich is over a year after his hire date. One employee was hired on 8/21/19 and\ncompleted CPI training on 3/5/20. However, she did not complete another CPI\ntraining until 10/5/23 when she completed the refresher course.\nCCI Rule 400.4167 Case record maintenance\n(1) The insitution shall maintain a case record for\neach resident.\n(2) Service plans shall be signed and dated by the\nsocial services worker and the social services\nsupervisor.\nOne of eight closed youth files reviewed did not contain any service plans.\nTwo of eight closed youth files reviewed did not have supervisor signatures on all\nservice plans.",

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• The facility has stated more than once the reasons for some non-compliances\nare because they are meeting ORR requirements, but not considering licensing\nrequirements. To maintain licensing for this facility under the State of Michigan,\nlicensing rules must be followed regardless of any contractor requirements.\n• Variance requests must be submitted and approved prior to hiring or promoting a\ncandidate into a position. It is not acceptable to submit a variance after hiring has\nalready occurred. If there are questions as to whether someone meets the\nqualifications required in licensing rules, the facility can clarify with their assigned\nDCWL Consultant prior to hire. CPA rules should not be considered during the\nhiring process as these are not CPA staff.\n• Any staff that are rehired after leaving the agency or transfer from another\nBethany program to this facility must meet the requirements of Rule 400.1113.\n• On 3/26/24, Consultant provided the Quality Assurance Coordinator information\nsurrounding central registry background checks. Information included the\ndifferences between the CWL-4624 & CWL-1929, initial/annual requirements,\nsubmission timeframes, CPS history review FAQ document, and Communication\nIssuance 23-031 (Children’s Protective History Review for Employment).",
    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Typed report dates on some youth reports reflected 2023, but the reports were\nsigned 2024. Please make sure the typed report dates are correct prior to\napproval.\n• Staff are not allowed to utilize any CPI physical management skills until they are\nfully trained. Consultation was offered that the facility updates their policy to\noutline which staff are required to be trained in CPI, and when new hire staff will\nobtain CPI training in a timely manner.\n• Training records for staff do not reflect all training completed, which causes\nconfusion when auditing employee records. Please ensure consistency and\nproper maintenance to training records.\n• It is essential there be a checks and balances for new hire trainings to ensure\ntimely completion on Cornerstone or the \"completion date\" will not reflect the\ncorrect information for the audit.\n• Rule 400.4115 First Aid/CPR certification requires at least one staff on duty with\ncurrent First Aid/CPR certification. In reviewing personnel files many staff did not\nhave current First Aid/CPR certification. The agency needs to be mindful of\nwhich staff have certification to ensure they are available for the youth onsite and\noffsite.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere was 1 substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. The facility had one staff member substantiated for maltreatment during the\nperiod of review. This occurred as a result of SIR #2023C0000686 dated 10/16/23;\nCAP approved 11/22/23. The staff member was placed on administrative leave on\n8/15/23 and was ultimately terminated from employment based on the findings of\nthe investigation.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe 2023 Interim inspection resulted in six violations related to 400.4113(1)(f)(ii)\ncriminal history checks, 400.4113(1)(i) central registry checks, 400.4127(4)\nobservation checks, 400.4506(1) fire drills, 400.4167(1) case record maintenance\nand ACT 116 722.120(c) falsification. The CAP was approved on 5/25/23. The\nfacility demonstrated improved compliance in all of these areas except for\n400.4113(1)(i) central registry checks and 400.4167(1) case record maintenance.\nIt should be noted the facility did not meet compliance with Rule 400.4113(1)(i)\nduring the 2022 Renewal Audit either. Chief Administrator (CA) noted the",
    "background check information survey they have potential new hires complete has\nsignificantly improved the facility’s compliance with conducting background checks\non all previous names and aliases of the candidate. CA noted despite the facility\ncompleting the central registry checks, delays ensue while awaiting approval from\nthe Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) before new hires can commence work,\nwhich causes the central registry checks to be over 30 days old by the time the\nemployee is officially hired. CA noted to rectify this, they have initiated new\nprocedures effective January 2024. These procedures include the inclusion of the\nexpected start date of the employee in the staff’s new hire checklist, submitting a\nCWL-1929 for processing if the CWL-4624 is over 30 days old, and a second-tier\nreview system where the Quality Assirance coordinator examines the file of all new\nhires prior to their start date to ensure compliance.\nSIR 2023C0000686 dated 10/16/23 had violations for Rule 400.4112(4)(a)\nregarding staff's ability to perform the duties assigned and 400.4109(1)(c)\nregarding the facility's program statement/policies. The facility has demonstrated\ncompliance with the CAP during quarterly CAP reviews.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility’s 12-month budget and December 2022 financial audit were reviewed.\nThere were no financial concerns noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) noted staff recruitment and retention has been the\ngreatest challenge and impediment to licensing compliance. CA noted the CAPs\nimplemented over the reporting period resulted in a deeper awareness and\nunderstanding by staff of why the “line of sight” requirement for youth supervision\nis necessary, and how it protects staff and youth. CA noted shift logs were\nredesigned to include location of outings and identify staff and youth participating.\nThere were also changes to the outings policy and staff to youth ratio has\nincreased where deemed necessary. In addition, GPS tracking and supervisor\nreview/approval of outings was instituted. CA reported the new policy created to\naddress the hiring of former clients includes a screening tool, which has been\nhelpful to make decisions during the hiring process. CA reported the facility\ncontinues to work to stabilize staffing, increase longevity of staffing and holding\nstaff more accountable for licensing rules. CA noted bi-weekly team meetings and\nmonthly direct care staff meetings will continue to occur throughout the year. In\naddition, program management and leadership staff will meet regularly to ensure\ncompliance with all rules/requirements and make changes to internal practices as\nnecessary.",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nStaff feel the last year has led to a lot of changes due to another facility occupying\nthe third floor of Bridgeway for the last year. As a result, the second and third floor\nteams have had increased communication and consistency. Staff feel everyone is\nvery caring, empathetic, and compassionate towards the youth they serve. Staff\nfeel the new leadership team has created an environment where everyone\ndemonstrates they’re open to feedback and suggestions. Staff feel the team is\nvery solution focused. Staff feel supported in their roles and feel leadership does a\ngreat job in explaining how changes at the facility affect everyone’s individual\nroles. Staff feel changes in policies and procedures are well communicated in\nTEAMS and during bi-weekly staff meetings. One staff noted the facility needs to\nimprove training and have a more structured new-hire training. The staff member\nreported it’s being worked on, but it seems to be tough to find time to develop and\nimplement it.\nYouth reported there was nothing they disliked about the facility. Youth reported\nstaff treat them well, they get enough food, they like the food, they feel safe and\nthere is nothing they would change.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 3/11/24. The only concern noted was the\nmedication cart being unlocked, but facility staff locked it when Consultant was\npresent.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 26, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 27, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
