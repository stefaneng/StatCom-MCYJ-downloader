A renewal inspection report which indicated that\nthe foster parents separated in June causing the foster mother to move to a new\nhome; however, a new application (3889) and licensing transaction record (3706)\nindicating the address change and the removal of the foster father from the license\nwas not submitted until the following January. Additionally, no relocation study was\ncompleted on the foster mother’s new residence.\nR 400.12325 License recommendation.\n(3) Except for an original license, an agency shall recommend\nto the department the issuance of a regular license or the\ncontinuation of an active license only when all rules are in\ncompliance or both of the following conditions exist:\n(b) A written corrective action plan has been\ndeveloped.

    "One of eight foster home files reviewed contained a corrective action plan that did\nnot ensure the safety of the children in the home. The corrective action plan was\nrequired after it was determined that the foster parent cussed at and slapped a\nyouth.
