The Independent Living Worker advised Youth A should\nwash all items in hot water, vacuum, and to contain the items. The\nIndependent Living Worker told Youth A the Independent Living\nWorker will let Life Skills Coach and House Manager know so she\ncan purchase youth a new mattress cover and bed bug spray. Life\nSkills Coach purchased items right away and met with Youth A on\n5/1/24 in the evening. Life Skills Coach texted caseworker on\n5/2/24 detailing her efforts. Life Skills Coach and youth flipped\nmattress, inspected baseboards, and carpet. They found one live\nbed bug and one dead. They sprayed the areas twice and\nvacuumed. Youth A was provided new cover and was told to wash\nitems weekly and to vacuum. Life Skills Coach advised Youth A to\nnot eat in their room as they found food crumbs on floor. Youth A\nstated she didn't eat in room. No other youth have reported bed\nbugs. Caseworker told upper management of issue on 5/1/24\nduring a meeting. A pest inspector can come to ILP house if need\nbe.\nI interviewed House Manager at the independent living placement\non 5/23/2024. House Manager substantiated the report by\nIndependent Living Worker. House Manager also stated the\nagency had previously contracted with a pest control company to\ninspect the home monthly, but that was discontinued when no\npest infestation treatments were ever required. I requested any\ndocumentation related to the most recent pest control inspections.\nI interviewed Youth B in Youth B’s room on 5/23/2024. Youth B\ndenied having any bed bugs in Youth B’s room.\n2",
