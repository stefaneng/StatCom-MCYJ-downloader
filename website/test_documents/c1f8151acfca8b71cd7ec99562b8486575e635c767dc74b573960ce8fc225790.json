    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10157\nSection Health services; policies and procedures\nDescription (1) A facility shall establish and follow written health service\npolicies and procedures that address all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical and dental care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 4/23/2025 at 8:40 PM, a youth was experiencing chest pain\nand requested to be sent to the ER. Youth has a known history of\nasthma and did not have home medications available on-site. The\npain was not relieved by a nebulizer treatment administered at the\nfacility. The facility supervisor speculated the episode may have\nbeen anxiety-related and noted that youth had repeatedly\nrequested hospital care, which the supervisor declined. Another\nstaff member requested the youth be transported to the ER due to\npersistent symptoms. These requests were denied by the\nsupervisor, who expressed the repeated appeals for outside\nmedical attention were \"getting on her nerves\" and dismissed\nthem as non-emergency. A phone triage was completed on youth,\nsupervisor was instructed to administer a saline nebulizer\ntreatment to combat any congestion and TUMS for any indigestion\nfollowing that night's nachos for dinner. When symptoms remained\nunresolved, supervisor was directed to transport youth to the\nnearest hospital for further evaluation. Youth was subsequently\ntaken to the hospital. Later that day, the other staff member\nrecalled that youth began complaining of chest pain as early as\n7:00 PM—nearly 1 hour and 40 minutes before supervision was\ncontacted. It was confirmed that youth repeatedly requested to be\ntransported to the ER and those requests were denied by the\nsupervisor, despite youth’s persistent symptoms and visible\nphysical distress. Youth was \"begging\" the supervisor for nearly\ntwo hours before finally contacting the nurse for approval for ER\ntransport.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nNurse was interviewed via phone on July 15, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Nurse reported that since\nshe was involved in the last investigation, 2025SIC0000730, she\nneeded to address this concern due to potential medical neglect.\nShe reported during the previous investigation, she found the\nfacility is not following this written medical policy for emergency\nneeds. Nurse reported in April 2025, Youth A was placed at the\nfacility. She reported that upon admission, it was found Youth A\nhad asthma, and his mother did not bring his required inhalers\n2",
    "right away. Nurse reported on April 23, 2025, she received a call\nfrom Supervisor around 8:40pm to report Youth A had unrelieved\nchest pain after receiving a nebulizer treatment. Shre reported\nSupervisor believed it to be from anxiety or possible indigestion\nfrom the nachos dinner that evening. Nurse reported she\ninstructed Supervisor to give Youth A antacids and oxygen. She\nreported when she checked back in, Youth A was still in pain and\ninstructed Supervisor to take Youth A into the emergency room.\nNurse reported Supervisor reported she would take him, but\nhoped it was not a waste of time. She reported Youth A was in the\nhospital for a couple of hours and was diagnosed with generalized\nchest pain. Nurse reported the next day, Mother called and was\nangry. She reported Mother was demanding to know why she was\nnot told that Youth A was going to the hospital for chest pains and\nbreathing issues. Nurse reported Supervisor had called Mother\nfirst and asked her to bring Youth A’s medications to the facility,\nbut it was Youth A who called Mother when he was at the hospital.\nShe reported she checked in on Youth A on April 24, 2025, to see\nhow he was feeling. Nurse reported Youth A reported he was\nfeeling fine now and denied needing any other medical care. She\nreported she did ask Youth A what happened the night before and\nreported he wanted to go to the hospital for chest pains and\nbreathing issues, but Supervisor said no and it would be a waste\nof time, but Staff 1 advocated for him to go to the hospital, which\nhe eventually did. Nurse reported she spoke with Staff 1 on April\n24, 2025, about what occurred on April 23, 2025. She reported\nStaff 1 reported around 7pm, Youth A was having chest pains,\nand he reported this to Supervisor. Staff 1 reported he told\nSupervisor that Youth A needed to go to the hospital, but\nSupervisor said no. He reported Supervisor told him she had to\ncontact Nurse first per policy. Staff 1 told Nurse that Youth A did\neventually go to the hospital, but it was two hours after his\nsymptoms started, and he felt it was too long of a wait. Nurse was\nasked about getting Youth A’s medications from his mother, and\nshe reported he was without his medications for a few days. She\nreported they attempted to ask for these medications numerous\ntimes and were going to have them re-prescribed the next day\nwhen the doctor was at the facility. When asked about the\nnebulizer treatment, Nurse explained this is onsite for anyone to\nuse if a youth is having a breathing problem. She reported\nSupervisors are trained to administer this.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at his home on July 11,\n2025, by MDHHS Worker. This consultant attempted to be\navailable by phone, but Mother refused to allow this\nconsultant to be on the phone during the interview. The\n3",
    "following interview details are from notes by MDHHS Worker\nwho completed the said interview. MDHHS Worker asked\nYouth A to explain what happened in April, 2025 while he was at\nthe facility and having an asthma attack. Youth A reported around\n7:30pm, he started having chest pains and trouble breathing. He\ntold Staff 1 about his concerns, and Staff 1 took him to see Nurse.\nYouth A reported Nurse provided him with a breathing treatment\nand an inhaler and then was told to go back to his room. He\nreported he is still not feeling well after the treatment and told Staff\n1 about it. Youth A reported Staff 1 told Supervisor Youth A\nneeded to go to the hospital, and Youth A was finally taken at\n8pm. He reported he received treatment for his asthma while at\nthe ER and was discharged a few hours later. Youth A reported\nSupervisor told him she did not want him to have Youth A go, and\nit would be a waste of money. He reported he otherwise felt safe\nat the facility and had no other medical concerns while he was\nthere.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on July\n15, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor\nreported she was the supervisor on shift on April 23, 2025. She\nreported she received a call from Staff 1, who reported Youth A\nwas playing a board game with him and started to complain of\nchest pain. Supervisor reported she knew Youth A had asthma\nand they were still waiting for Mother to bring the inhaler up to the\nfacility. She reported it was approved by Administrator for Youth A\nto use this nebulizer treatment at the facility. Supervisor reported\nshe administered the treatment and verified the medication was\nup-to-date. She reported after the treatment, Youth A went back to\nhis pod. Shre reported she waited for about 15-20 minutes to see\nif the symptoms had improved, but they did not. Staff 1 reported to\nSupervisor, Youth A was still complaining of chest pain, and Staff\n1 felt Youth A needed to go to the hospital. Supervisor denied\nYouth A ever directly asking her to go to the hospital or telling him\nthat he was not going to go. She reported she told Staff 1 she was\ngoing to call Nurse. Supervisor contacted Nurse, who asked\nSupervisor to check his vitals and report back. Nurse advised\nSupervisor to give Youth A Tums, administer treatment, and\nGatorade, and if he was not feeling better, to take him to the ER in\nabout an hour. About forty-five minutes later Supervisor chose for\nYouth A to go to the hospital. She admitted she did comment on\nhoping the trip to the hospital was not a waste, but it's better to be\nsafe than sorry. Supervisor denied ever noting it was a waste of\nmoney. She was asked about contacting Mother, and she\nreported she contacted Mother at the site of Youth A’s symptoms\nand asked for her to bring his medications. Supervisor reported\n4",
    "Mother told her she would bring the medications tomorrow\nmorning, and Supervisor did confirm with Mother that Youth A\nreceived a nebulizer treatment. She reported she attempted to call\nMother twice when Youth A was going to the hospital, but she\ncould not get through to her. Supervisor was asked about the\ngeneral understanding of the facility’s medical policy, and she\nreported she had an understanding of the policy. She reported\nthat staff on site should try to meet the youths’ medical needs first\nbefore sending them out for medical treatment. She explained if\nthe nurse is on site, they will triage in person, and if not, then this\nis completed over the phone. When asked who decided if a youth\nshould go to the hospital, she said it’s a collaboration between\nsupervision and the nurses. Supervisor agreed that supervisors\ncan decide to take a youth to the hospital even if the nurse does\nnot agree. When asked about communication and documentation\nof medical issues, Supervisor reported she sent an email directly\nto Administrator. She reported she did not do an exact incident\nreport because everything was laid out in her email about the\nevents that occurred. When asked to provide a timeline of the\nevents that took place she reported the following: 8 pm was\nnotified by Staff 1 that Youth A was having chest pains; 8:10pm\nprovided a nebulizer treatment to Youth A; 8:20pm called Mother\nabout medication and treatment; 8:30pm Staff 1 reported Youth A\nwas still reporting chest pain; 8:40pm Supervisor called Nurse;\n9:20pm Youth A was sent to the hospital for further care.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported he\nwas playing cards with Youth A on April 2025, when Youth A\nstarted to complain his chest was hurting. He reported he could\nnot remember the exact time of day this occurred, but believes it\nwas around 7pm. Staff 1 reported when Youth A started to\ncomplain, he grabbed Youth A some water and called Supervisor.\nHe reported Supervisor gave the direction to give Youth A some\nTums because it may be heartburn, and call back in a few minutes\nif that does not give relief. Staff 1 reported Youth A still\ncomplained of pain, so he called Supervisor back, who then\ncontacted Nurse. Supervisor then brought Youth A down to the\nnurses’ station to receive a nebulizer treatment. Staff 1 reported\nSupervisor was in contact with Nurse and provided Nurse with\nYouth A’s vital information. He reported Youth A’s symptoms did\nnot get better, and Staff 1 was given directions to bring Youth A to\nthe hospital. Staff 1 reported he called Mother on the pod before\nthey left for the hospital, and she met them at the hospital. He\nreported he could not remember exactly when they left for the\nhospital, but it was believed that it was a little before 10pm. Staff 1\n5",
    "denied Youth A ever directly asking to see a physical. He reported\nwhen he was talking to Supervisor about the situation, Staff 1 was\nthe one who brought Youth A to the hospital because he could\nsee Youth A was not getting any relief. Staff 1 reported Supervisor\nwas following the policy, where she contacted Nurse and tried to\nhelp with Youth A’s symptoms at the facility before rushing to the\nhospital. He reported Youth A told him he felt safe with Staff 1\nadvocating for him. Staff 1 reported the medical policy is for staff\nto first see if they can help the youth’s medical concern and\ncontact Supervisor if a youth has a more urgent need. He reported\nSupervisor is to then contact Nurse and see about next steps, and\ncan bring a youth to the hospital if deemed necessary. Staff 1\nreported he felt the situation was handled appropriately and in a\ntimely manner. He reported he never talked to Nurse about this\nsituation. Staff 1 reported there was no one else involved in this\nsituation, and the other youth in the pod were in bed when these\nmedical decisions were being made. He reported he cannot\nremember exactly what Supervisor said about bringing Youth A to\nthe hospital. Staff 1 reported Supervisor commented on something\nalong the lines of hoping this situation is not a waste of time, but\nbetter safe than sorry. He reported this was never directly stated\nto Youth A and could not remember the context of the statement\nor when it was stated.\nAdministrator was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nJuly 15, 2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker.\nAdministrator confirmed the facility is actively working on redoing\ntheir emergency medical care policy and will be retraining staff\nfrom the findings in special investigation 2025SIC0000730. He\nreported he was notified of Youth A going to the hospital on April\n23, 2025, and because Supervisor told her she could use her\nemail to him as the incident report. Administrator reported the\ncourt permitted him to allow a youth to receive medication\ntreatment, such as a nebulizer, when the parent is not following\nthrough with giving prescribed medications. He reported\npermission was granted for Youth A to receive a nebulizer\ntreatment, as it notes in his chart that he has asthma and staff\nhave been attempting to obtain his inhalers from Mother for a few\ndays.\nMother was interviewed face to face at his home on July 11,\n2025, by MDHHS Worker. This consultant attempted to be\navailable by phone, but Mother refused to allow this\nconsultant to be on the phone during the interview. The\nfollowing interview details are from notes by MDHHS Worker\nwho completed the said interview. Mother reported on April 23,\n6",
    "2025, she was contacted by Supervisor who reported Youth A\nwas having Asthma issues but was okay. About ten minutes later,\nMother received a call from Staff 1 reporting Youth A was not okay\nand he was going to take him to the hospital despite being told not\nto due to protocol. Mother reported she went to the hospital and\nstayed with Youth A until he was discharged. She reported she\nbelieved this was between 8pm-9pm, and he was discharged\nbefore midnight. Mother reported Youth A told her Supervisor had\ntold him he was not going to the hospital because it would be a\nwaste of money. She then stated she contacted Supervisor the\nnext day to confront her about what happened and not calling her\nback to tell her Youth A was not okay. Mother reported Supervisor\ndenied ever telling Youth A that it was a waste of money and\nstated she tried to call Mother but could not get through. MDHHS\nWorker asked Mother about Youth A’s medication, and she stated\nhe has an inhaler and Singular. Mother reported Youth A was not\nprescribed a nebulizer and did not know whose treatment he was\ngiven. MDHHS Worker asked Mother if she had dropped his\nmedications off at the facility before the hospital visit, and she\nstated she does not remember the exact date she dropped the\nmedications off at the facility.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported\nhe is frustrated with being at the facility because he does not like\nthe food and would rather be home. He reported he does not feel\nunsafe at the facility. Youth B reported he has never had a\nmedical emergency at the facility or any medical issue concerns.\nHe reported there was one youth on his pod; he could not\nremember his name, that sprained his ankle while playing\nbasketball, and the facility provided that youth with a brace. Youth\nB denied ever seeing any other medical emergencies at the\nfacility.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 21,\n2025, in collaboration with MDHHS Worker.

He\nreported he could not remember the youth’s name but noted staff\nresponded quickly when that youth hurt his foot and took him to\nthe hospital right away.\n7",
    "Tour of Facility\nA tour of the facility occurred on July 15, 2025, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. The nurse’s station was\nviewed by Administrator and Supervisor. The nebulizer machine\nwas set up. There was a box of expired cartages, but it was\nverified by Administrator and Supervisors that they are not being\nused and need to be disposed of. This consultant watched\nAdministrator dispose of the expired cartages. Supervisor reported\nwhen she gave the treatment to Youth A in April, 2025 the\nmedication cartage had not expired as she verified it.\nAdministrator reported they are working with the health\ndepartment to get more cartages, but there have been some\nbarriers with getting a consistent doctor to prescribe them.\nDocumentation Reviewed\n- Facility’s Medical Emergency Policy- This policy notes\nthat if a youth or staff member requires emergency medical\ncare the following steps shall be taken: 1. Determine the\nnature of the injury or illness with a as much detail as\npossible. 2. Notify appropriate medical personnel or\nemergency medical ambulance services, depending upon\nthe extent of the illness or injury. 3. If the youth or staff\nmember can be moved, he/she should be assisted to the\nappropriate medical services for diagnosis and/or\ntreatment. 4. If the youth/ staff member cannot be moved,\nemergency medical services shall be brought to the injured\nparty. 5. The Superintendent shall be notified of all severe\nmedical incidents and an Incident Report shall be filed\nbefore the end of the shift. 6. 911 shall be used for all\nemergency calls.\n- Facility’s Resident Management/Resident Rights\npolicy- This document outlines that medical care shall be\nprovided for all youth and no youth shall be denied access\nto a licensed physician upon request.\n- Bronson Hospital After Visit summary for Youth A- This\nafter visit documentation from the hospital shows Youth A\nwas brought into the hospital on April 23, 2025 and seen by\na doctor at 10:32pm and was discharged at 11:36pm.\nThere were no acute medical needs found, and Youth A\nwas provided with a steroid per Mother’s request. Mother\nwas noted to be at the hospital with Youth A.\n8",
    "- Email to Administration team from Supervisor dated\nApril 24, 2025, 12:23 am- This email is the details that\nwere sent out about Youth A’s medical care needs and\ngoing to the hospital. This email notes the exact events\nnoted from Supervisor’s interview. This email was noted to\nbe the incident report.\n- Email to Administration team from Nurse dated April\n24, 2025, 1:09 am- Nurse emailed in response to\nSupervisor’s initial email noting that Supervisor did\neverything correctly per her advice.\n- Email to Administration team from Nurse dated April\n24, 2025, 11:13 am- Nurse emailed noting she had\nfollowed up with Youth A, Supervisor, Staff 1, and Mother\nabout the events that occurred the night prior. Nurse first\nprovided her details of the steps she took when Supervisor\ncalled her on April 23, 2025 at 8:40pm. She noted within\nthis email Supervisor believed it was more of an anxiety\nattack but had given a nebulizer treatment to Youth A prior\nto her calling Nurse. Nurse reported she asked for vitals\nwhich Supervisor provided and deemed them to be stable.\nShe noted she “could see Youth A was in pain but not\nactively in distress that would warrant calling 911”. Nurse\nnoted all the triage medical questions she went through\nwith Supervisor on Youth A and noted Supervisor followed\nall her prompts. Nurse noted her conversation with Mother\nwho was very upset. Within the email Nurse wrote, “I\ngenuinely do understand her concerns, but in my\nprofessional opinion- I believed Youth A received the\nproper care in a good amount of time. It is not our protocol\nto send children to the hospital without doing some form of\nan assessment. Youth A’s vitals were stable enough for\nSupervisor to assess in the building, so we were well within\nour consent to treat until we could not anymore, in which\nthe ER was then suggestion and Youth A was taken to\nBronson Er.”\n- Text messages between Nurse and Supervisor from\nApril 23, 2025- Supervisor started off with sending Nurse\nthe medical vitals of Youth A. Nurse reported they were\ngreat and he needs to do slow deep breaths. Supervisor\nverified this was being done. Nure reported, “This sounds\n9",
    "dumb- but you can give him a Gatorade as a placebo and\nsee if he improves. IT might trick his mind. If he’s still in\npain and symptomatic by 9:30pm and saying his check\nhurts I’d take him to the ER. He doesn’t sound like he is\nhaving an asthma attack.” There was continued\ncommunication about Youth A’s health and Supervisor\nverified Youth A’s health. Supervisor noted Staff 1\ncontinued to state Youth A needs to be sent to the hospital\nand “it was getting annoying.” Nurse wrote back stating, “I\ndon’t want him to have an episode but his vitals are stable.\nStaff 1 is probably just freaking out. I’ve seen people in\nworse shape get discharged but to be fair I wasn’t there\nand I don’t know if they were running playing, etc.”\nSupervisor responded with, “He was playing a board game\nand it started out of no where. It will probably be a waste of\ntime to send him, but better safe than sorry.” Nurse\nresponded with,” Yes better safe than Sorry! If he does to\nthe ER just mentioned he just received a Neb.” Nurse then\ncontinued to talk to Supervisor about what to say to the ER.\nSupervisor verified via text message to Nurse that Youth A\nwas brought into the hospital. There was no time stamp\ndating these text messages.\n- Supervisor Human Resource File- Supervisor has no\ndisciplinary actions noted within her HR file. She is in\ncompliance with all trainings. Her last medical training was\nnoted to be 12/13/2024 and her Safety and Security\nEmergency Procedures training was completed on\n06/12/2024.\n- Youth A’s File- Permission to provide emergency\nmedications was provided within the file.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with Supervisor following their\nmedical policy. It was never found that Youth A directly stated he\nwanted to see a physician, but Supervisor took the situation\nserious with contacting Nurse for further support on Youth A’s\nmedical concerns. Supervisor also made the call to bring him to\nthe hospital sooner than when Nurse suggested to bring Youth A.\nTechnical Assistance:\nThe facility was provided technical assistance to make sure to\ncontinue to update their medical policy as they are doing within\nthe corrective action plan for Special Investigation\n10",
    "2025SIC0000730. The facility needs to be clear on the\nexpectation of the incident report, and it is suggested to do an\nactual incident report document rather than just an email. The\nfacility was also provided feedback to make sure medications they\nhave on hand that could be used to treat youth are not expired.\nThe nebulizer medication seen in the medical room was found to\nbe expired but it was unknown what date the medication Youth A\nreceived for his treatment. The facility did dispose of the expired\nmedication during the onsite visit.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n08/12/2025\n____________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n08/15/2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n11"
