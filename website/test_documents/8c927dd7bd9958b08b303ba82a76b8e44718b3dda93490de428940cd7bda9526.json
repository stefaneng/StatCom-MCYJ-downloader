Bed checks are to be made every 15 minutes from 8:30\np.m. (or the time the youth go to bed) to 7:00 a.m. Bed check\nnotations are to be made on the team log debriefing sheet.\nNotations should indicate the exact time the check was made and\nthe atmosphere at that time.

Bed check logs\nviewed at the facility on 7/9/24 consistently documented that bed\nchecks were completed every 15-minutes but lacked variety. For\nexample, bed check documentation would indicate completion at\n12:00 am, 12:15 am, 12:30 am, 12:45 am, etc. rather than varying\nintervals.\nAnalysis The agency is found to be in non-compliance with the licensing\nrule.

    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff is not providing outdoor recreation to youth.\nInvestigation Investigation was assigned on 7/10/2024.\nSafehaus is a non-secure short-term co-ed facility that does not\ncontract with MDHHS and does not have video cameras inside the\nresidential home.\nInterviews:\nAll of the following interviews were completed on 07/09/2024 at\nSafehaus unless otherwise noted. An unannounced visit was\nconducted to the facility on this date.\nYouth A, Youth B and Youth C were interviewed. Youth A\nreported she has been at the facility for 3 days and today is her\nfirst time she has been afforded outdoor recreation. Youth B\nreported having been at the facility for two days and denied having\nany outdoor recreation. Youth C reported not being allowed to go\noutside for recreation in the two days she has been at the facility.\nChief administrator (CA) was interviewed and asked for an\nupdate regarding outdoor recreation for youth at the facility. He\nadvised that since the last unannounced visit the policy had been\nupdated and changes made to the back yard areas to allow youth\nto engage in outdoor recreation. CA also provided photographs\nfor review that showed staff and youth outside on the back porch\nengaging in what appeared to be yoga.\nPresident of Crisis Residential (PCR) was interviewed and she\nadvised that youth are allowed to engage in outdoor recreation.\nAfter interviewing youth at the facility, PCR was advised that youth\nwho were interviewed reported having been at the facility for at\nleast 5 days and denied that they had participated in any outdoor\nrecreation. PCR advised that the policy allows for discretion of the\nstaff to take the youth for outdoor recreation based on weather,\nbehavior and other issues that could occur. PCR was asked if she\nhad any documentation that would support decisions made by\nstaff to not allow youth to engage in outdoor recreation based on\nweather, behavior or anything else and she responded no.\nStaff 2 was interviewed and advised that it was her first day of\nemployment, thus she was unable to speak regarding schedule or\npractices of youth going outside for recreation.\n3",
    "Staff 1 was interviewed and she denied that youth are afforded\nthe opportunity to go outside daily for recreation. She further\nadded that she believed that the youth could benefit for more\nphysical activity.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nSafehaus Policy for Outdoor activities - U1099: The policy\nindicates that Safehaus Main and Safehaus Too will allow youth to\nspend up to 1 hour per day outdoors (weather permitting) in the\nbackyard of each home and participate in an activity that is\nsuitable for their age and skill level.\nAnalysis The agency is found to be in non-compliance with the licensing\nrule. Interviews of both staff and youth at the facility resulted in\nverification that youth are not receiving outdoor recreation\nactivities as indicated in the agency policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A Corrective Action Plan is required.\n09/19/2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n09/25/2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n4"
