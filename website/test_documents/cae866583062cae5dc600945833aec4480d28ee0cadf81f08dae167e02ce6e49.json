Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was attempting to de-\nescalate Youth A, and Youth B went into the sensory room. While\nYouth B was in the sensory room, Youth A was banging on the\ndoor aggressively.

Staff\n1 reported he went through some coaching during the video\nreview but was told he wasn’t going to be written up. Staff 1\nreported he was told he could have positioned himself better by\nstanding more in front of Youth B than he was. Staff 1 reported he\nspoke with Youth A later that night to process the situation, and\nthere was no animosity afterwards.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/10/25\nin coordination with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported Youth A\nwas sitting at the table right inside the facility. Staff 2 reported she\n4",
    "is the staff with the closest relationship to him, and she could tell\nhe was irritated. Staff 2 reported she tried to make bracelets with\nhim and play cards with him to distract him.

Staff 2 reported Youth B\ntried to leave the situation by going to the sensory room. Staff 2\nreported Youth A went to the sensory room door and began\nbanging on it. Staff 2 reported she redirected Youth A’s behavior\nby stepping in between him and the door. Youth B came out of the\nsensory room and stated she wanted to take a walk. Youth B went\nto the vestibule area. On her way there, Youth A tried to throw a\nfootball at Youth B, but Staff 2 prevented it from happening. Staff\n2 reported Youth A began heading for the vestibule area, and\nStaff 2 let him proceed because she thought Youth B was already\noutside. Staff 2 reported she heard Staff 4 yell, “[Staff 1] close the\ndoor”. Staff 1 tried to close the door to the vestibule, but Youth A\nforced his way through and then the door to the vestibule shut.\nStaff 2 reported a second later, the door opened, and she saw\nYouth A getting put against the wall by Staff 1. Staff 2 reported\nshe stepped in between Youth A and Staff 1 to separate them.\nStaff 2 reported she hoped it would de-escalate the situation by\nbeing in between them. Staff 2 reported unfortunately it didn’t help\nbecause she is short, and they reached over her shoulders. Staff\n2 reported Youth A was trying to hit Staff 1 over her shoulders, but\nshe couldn’t see what Staff 1 was doing because her back was\ntowards him. Staff 2 reported she redirected Youth A away from\nthe situation. Staff 2 reported she saw blood dripping down Youth\nA's leg, so she gave him a few minutes to be in his room to de-\nescalate, and then she went into his room to tend to his wound\nwith alcohol wipes and band-aids. Staff 2 reported Youth A was\nfinally ready to talk and began crying immediately, Staff 2 reported\nYouth A said, “I’m going to beat the fuck out of [Staff 1]. Why did\nhe just do that?”.

Staff 2 reported she encouraged Youth A to talk to Staff\n1 later and express himself in a healthy way. Staff 2 reported Staff\n1 and Youth A talked for approximately 10 minutes. Youth A\napologized to Staff 1 for coming through the vestibule door, and\nadmitted he was planning to follow Youth B and “keep talking\nshit”. Staff 1 said, “I’m sorry it got there. I just didn’t know what you\nwere going to do”. Staff 2 reported Youth A and Staff 1 have\ninteracted fine with each other ever since the incident, and they\nhave a good connection. Staff 2 reported the movements Staff 1\nmade towards Youth A were not the best in the situation. Staff 2\nreported Youth A reacts poorly to men in some escalated\n5",

Staff 3 reported he saw Youth A and Staff 1\nin a scuffle, and he immediately began trying to de-escalate Youth\nA. Staff 3 reported it was clear Staff 1 was trying to protect Youth\nB and Youth C, but Staff 1 pushing Youth A was questionable.\nStaff 3 reported he talked to Staff 1 about the situation afterwards\nand offered suggestions of how Staff 1 could have handled it\nbetter. Staff 3 reported Staff 1 reacted quickly to keep Youth A\naway, which was more of a quick reaction rather than processing\nthe whole situation. Staff 3 reported when staff block youth, they\nare supposed to put a hand in front of themselves and step\nbackwards into the movement if a youth goes forward, but they\nare not supposed to use a forward motion with youth.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 3/5/25 was reviewed, but there is no audio on\nthe video.
