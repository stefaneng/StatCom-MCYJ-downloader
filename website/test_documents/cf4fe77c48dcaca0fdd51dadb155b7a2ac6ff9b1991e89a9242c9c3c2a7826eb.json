    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff and youth got into an argument in which another staff person\nhad to break it up and youth felt staff's hand on her cheek.\nInvestigation I reviewed intake dated 04/07/2023. It states last night Youth A\nthrew water on Staff Person 1 and as a result Staff Person 1 was\nmad at Youth A. The two got into an argument which another staff\nperson had to break it up. At one point Youth A reports feeling\nStaff Person 1’s hand on her cheek. Youth A has no marks or\nbruises from the altercation. Complainant and Director has no\nadditions allegations.\nIncident reports from Staff Person 1, 2, 3, and Director dated\n04/06/2023 between the 06:00pm and 09:54pm were reviewed.\nThey are consistent in reporting that Youth A was outside, not\ncompleting chores, and then entered the unit and began arguing\nwith staff about her chores. Youth A left the unit again and\nsometime later came back on the unit. Youth A went to her\nbedroom and asked where her belongings were and began\narguing and threatening to pour water and soap on all staff. Staff\nPerson 1 began to attempt to verbally deescalate Youth A. Youth\nA became increasing agitated and approached Staff Person 1.\nStaff Person 2 and 3 intervened as Youth A threw water at Staff\nPerson 1. Staff Person 1 was directed to exit the area as she was\nYouth A’s target. Youth A continued to be escalated and began\nthrowing items out of the refrigerator. Director began intervening\nat which point Youth A proceeded to exit the facility with staff\nshadowing her.\nI attempted to interview Youth A onsite on 04/11/2023. She\nreports being placed at the facility sometime after Christmas from\na foster home placement. She reports that she does not like her\ncurrent placement and wants to move back to Detroit. Youth A\nstates she does not want to discuss what transpired when she\npoured water on staff.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 onsite on 04/11/2023. She reports\nbeing employed as a youth care worker by the facility for four\nmonths and is up to date with her training requirements. She\nreports having a good rapport with Youth A and states she came\noutside to discuss her chore completion with Staff Person 2 and 4.\nShe reports Youth A was upset about everything when she\nreturned inside the unit and began asking aggressively about the\nwhereabouts of her DVD player and threatening to throw water on\nstaff. She states Staff Persons 2, 3, and 4 were present and\n2",
    "attempted to verbally intervene prior to Youth A throwing water at\nher. Staff Person 1 reports Youth A then threw water at her and\nthat Staff Person 2 stepped in between the two after it occurred\nand directed Staff Person 1 to step away as she was the target of\nYouth A’s anger. Staff Person 1 states she attempted to secure\nthe water bottle from Youth A but was not able to do so. She also\ndenies placing her hand on Youth A’s check as she alleges. Staff\nPerson 1 reports she left the unit for a couple minutes and upon\nreturn to retrieve some of her belongings noticed Youth A messing\nwith the refrigerator and that she again left the unit.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 onsite on 04/11/2023. She states\nStaff Person 1 was attempting to verbally deescalate Youth A\nnoting that Staff Person 1 is usually good with Youth A and that\nYouth A responds well to Staff Person 1. Staff Person 2 states\nYouth A was becoming even more escalated and decided to\nswitch positions with Staff Person 1 at which point Youth A threw\nwater on the two of them. She states she did not observe were\nanyone’s hands were placed as both she and Staff Person 1 were\nwiping water away. Staff Person 2 states directing Staff Person 1\nout of the area as Staff Person 1 appeared to be Youth A’s target.\nStaff Person 2 states Staff Person 1 was repeatedly attempting to\nverbally deescalate Youth A and did not observe any antagonizing\nof her.\nI interviewed Staff Person 3 via telephone on 04/11/2023. She\nreports being employed as a youth care worker by the facility for\nsix months and is up to date with her training requirements. She\nreports Youth A was escalated and that Staff Person 1 was\nattempting to verbally deescalate her without antagonizing her.\nShe reports Youth A threw water at Staff Person 1 and was trying\nto further charge toward her.

She\nstates Youth A usually has a good relationship with Staff Person 1\nand that Youth A can to talk with Staff Person 1 with relative ease.\nShe reports Youth A was escalated and that Staff Person 3 was\nwalking with her as Staff Person 1 was attempting to verbally\ndeescalate her. Staff Person 4 states she was in the process of\n3",
    "escorting the other residents down the hallway and turned to see\nStaff Person 2 and 3 step in between Youth A and Staff Person 1\nand Youth A threw the water.\nI interviewed Director 1 onsite on 04/11/2023. She states she did\nnot observe the incident in which water was thrown. She reports\nobserving Youth A throwing items and pushing staff. Staff were\nable to calm her down slightly at which point Youth A exited the\nunit. After Youth A returning to the unit, she explained to Director\nwhat had occurred with the water. She notes Youth A appeared\nto be in a power struggle when she mentioned a hand on her\ncheck during the incident and that Youth A would not further\nelaborate on the details.\nAnalysis There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Youth A and Staff\nPerson 1 were arguing to the point that another staff person had\nto break it up. Staff present all report Youth A being angry,\nargumentative, and threatening upon entering the unit. All staff\nreport Staff Person 1 has good rapport with Youth A and was\nattempting to verbally deescalate her and that Youth A targeted\nher anger toward Staff Person 1. Staff Persons 2 and 3 were\naware of Youth A’s potential explosiveness and positioned\nthemselves accordingly and intervened as Youth A threw water at\nStaff Person 1 and 2. Staff Person 1 removed herself from the\nscene as she was Youth A’s identified target and continued to be\nescalated once she left the unit. There is also no conclusive\nevidence to indicate staff’s hand was on Youth A’s cheek. Youth\nA refused to be interviewed regarding the incident.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
