Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nAgency is not providing reasonable efforts to reunify family in a foster care case\nduring the period of 8/21/21-11/10/21.\nINVESTIGATION:\nInterviews\nOn 2/14/2022 I received a complaint filed through the on-line reporting system\nalleging the following: Family Court finding stated the agency was not providing\nreasonable efforts during the period of 8/21/21-11/10/21.\nSupervisor - On 2/28/2022 I interviewed Supervisor at the agency. Supervisor\nreported that during winter of last year, Foster Care Worker started working on\nsubsidized guardianship for this case, which was approved by the guardianship\noffice in May of 2021. Right around that same time a different Judge took over the\ncase and was unhappy that Parent B had not been made a legal parent which\ndelayed the guardianship. Supervisor reported the court had previously wanted\nParent B listed as a putative parent on all service plans which is what was done.\nOnce Parent B became the legal parent, a meeting was held between the agency\nstaff and the prosecutor before returning to court in September. At the September\nhearing, the judge did not want to adjudicate Parent B and wanted to move toward\nthe subsidized guardianship; however, guardianship was not appointed at that time\nbecause the judge wanted a home study and fingerprinting completed on the relative\neven though the guardianship office had already approved the guardianship and\n2",
    "those things were not needed. Additionally, the judge asked for the development of a\nvisitation plan.\nAnother court hearing was held in November and the judge was not satisfied with\nthe visitation plan that had been developed because what the judge wanted a\ncomplete visit schedule, similar to a shared custody plan, for once the court was no\nlonger involved. Supervisor did not initially understand that this is what the court\nmeant by visitation plan as this is not something typically requested by a judge.\nAdditionally, while the relative home study had been completed, it had not been\nprovided to the court, unbeknownst to Supervisor. Supervisor reported that it was at\nthis hearing that the judge ordered reasonable efforts had not been made toward the\nguardianship due to the court not having the home study or the detailed visitation\nplan. Supervisor reported these two items were subsequently provided to the court\nand the case is now closed with the subsidized guardianship in place.\nFoster Care Worker - On 2/28/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker at the\nagency. Foster Care Worker’s statements included the same information provided\nby Supervisor. She also stated that she did not understand the court’s request for a\nvisitation plan, and as soon as she created the plan the judge wanted, the judge was\nsatisfied and ordered that reasonable efforts had been made.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 4/5/2022 I reviewed the case record in MiSACWIS and reviewed the following:\n Court Order 9/1/21, Reasonable effort were found to have been made toward\nfamily preservation and reunification, Reasonable efforts were found to have\nbeen made toward finalizing legal guardianship.\n Court Order 11/16/21, Reasonable efforts were not found to have been made\ntoward finalizing legal guardianship.\n Court Order 2/10/22 appointing Caregiver A as the legal guardian.\n Court Order 2/10/22 discharging court jurisdiction.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06 REASONABLE EFFORTS\nProvisions were enacted into federal law in the Adoption\nAssistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 USC 670 et seq.\nand the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997, 42\nUSC 1305 et seq., as well as Michigan’s Probate Code, 1939\nPA 288, MCL 701.1 et seq., that require judicial oversight when\na child is removed from his/her home. These provisions require\na judicial determination that reasonable efforts have been made\nby the supervising agency. The types of reasonable efforts\nwhich must be made by the department differ, depending on the\nstatus of the child. The four types of reasonable efforts\ndeterminations are to:\n3",
    "Prevent removal.\nMake it possible for the child to return home.\nFind that reasonable efforts are not required.\nFinalize the permanency plan.\nANALYSIS: The court made a determination at one hearing that the agency\nstaff did not make reasonable efforts toward achieving the goal\nof legal guardianship.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nLack of FTM engagement.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 2/14/2022 I received a complaint filed through the on-line reporting system\nalleging the following:\nThe home visit with Parent B that occurred on 10/18/2021 was counted as a\nFamily Team Meeting (FTM) however, there was no social work contact added in\nMiSACWIS for the FTM that occurred. Additionally, there was no attempt to\ninclude both caregivers and other case members in the required FTM.\nInterviews\nSupervisor - On 2/28/2022 I interviewed Supervisor at the agency. Supervisor\nreported Foster Care Worker had been assigned throughout the entirety of this case\nwhich had been open 3 ½ years. Supervisor reported that Parent A did not engage\nwell with the worker and did not participate when invited to FTMs.\nFoster Care Worker - On 2/28/2022 I interviewed Foster Care Worker at the\nagency. Foster Care Worker reported Parent A was invited to the majority of the\nFTM’s, but she didn’t often show up, which is documented in the case record. When\nthe mother did show up for virtual FTM’s she would attend with her camera off and\nwouldn’t participate much, if at all. Additionally, Foster Care Worker reported Parent\nA and Parent B did not get along and Foster Care Worker felt it was more productive\nto hold FTMs for each parent separately. Foster Care Worker reported she could\nhave more clearly documented this throughout the case as she believes after a few\nyears of this being an issue, she didn’t document the reasons the parents weren’t\ninvited to each other’s FTMs each time.\nDocuments Reviewed\nOn 4/5/2022 I reviewed the case record in MiSACWIS and reviewed the following:\n Case contact documented with Parent A and Parent B 8/21/21-11/10/21.\n4",
    " The 10/18/21 home visit was documented as such, with quality visit narrative\nincluded.\n The 10/18/21 FTM with Parent B was documented in the FTM hyperlink;\nhowever, the required document, Family Team Activity Report (DHS 1105) was\nnot present.\n A review of all 20 FTM’s documented to have been held was completed and of\nthose, only 4 included the required DHS 1105, which documents who\nparticipated. Of those 4, one was held in 2018 and the other three in 2019.

If a parent/caregiver declines to attend or\nparticipate in the pre-meeting discussion or FTM, the meeting\nmust proceed with other participants in attendance. If no other\nparticipants are identified, the caseworker and supervisor must\nproceed with a case conference to assess and plan for the\nchild’s safety, permanency, and well-being. The caseworker\nmust make active efforts to engage the parent or caregiver in\nthe FTM process until case closure. Engagement efforts and a\nparent’s denial of participation must be documented in the case\nservice plan\nP. 12 & 16 FTM PRACTICE GUIDANCE Documentation The\nDHS-1105, Family Team Meeting Report, is used to capture\nfamily demographics, FTM logistical information, needs,\nstrengths, action steps, safety concerns and the safety plan, and\nany recommendations made for the family during the FTM. The\nDHS-1105, FTM Report, must be completed for every FTM\nPost FTM Following the FTM, the caseworker is responsible for\nthe following:  Completing the DHS-1105, Family Team\nMeeting Report, checking it for accuracy, identifying areas\nneeding follow-up, and recording the outcome data.  Providing\nthe DHS-1105, Family Team Meeting Report, to all participants\n(in person and by phone), legal parents, and casework\nsupervisor.
