Foster Care Worker\nnever showed up.\n• 7/11/202 Foster Parent spoke to Foster Care Supervisor\nabout Youth A’s belonging because she felt Youth A\ndeserved to have them. Foster Care Supervisor told Foster\nParent she could get rid of some of the belongings such as\na pink office chair and a rug of Youth A’s because Foster\nCare Supervisor did not think they would fit in a vehicle and\nYouth A did not need them. Foster Parent reported that the\nrug was a birthday gift to Youth A and the office chair was\nsomething Youth A used daily, carrying it up and down the\nstairs throughout the day. Foster Parent kept “pushing” to\nFoster Care Supervisor that Youth A deserved her\nbelongings to which Foster Care Supervisor agreed and\ntold Foster Parent she would get all of the belongings to\nYouth A by the end of that week. Foster Parent reported\nshe did not hear anything the rest of that week.\n• 7/20/2023, prior to this scheduled interview, Foster Care\nWorker and Foster Care Supervisor showed up for Youth\nA’s belongings.

Foster Care\nWorker returned to Foster Parent’s home the following week and\nfilled her car with Youth A’s belongings which she dropped off to\nYouth A. Foster Care Worker stated that not everything would fit\nher car, so she made an appointment to return for the rest of the\nbelongings the following week. The following week, she asked\nFoster Parent if she could reschedule because Youth A had pink\neye. She rescheduled for 7/7/2023 but ended up in court longer\nthan expected. She reported she called Foster Parent after the\ncourt hearing to let her know she wouldn’t be able to make it that\nday. She stated she would take a screenshot of that call and text it\nas Foster Parent stated Foster Care Worker did not call her that\nday; however, she did.\nFoster Care Worker stated Foster Parent came into the office and\ntold Foster Care Supervisor that Foster Care Worker was not\ncalling her back after which Foster Care Worker reached out to\nher and scheduled a time to pick up the belongings with a bigger\ncar.

Foster Care Supervisor reported when Youth A\nwas initially replaced from Foster Parent’s home, she provided a\nlist of belonging she wanted. Foster Care Supervisor reported they\nwere able to get two car loads of belongings to Youth A, but there\nwere still a lot of belonging at Foster Parent’s home. She stated\nFoster Care Worker was working on picking up the belongings but\nthings kept coming up so she couldn’t do it. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated there were items such as broken doll parts,\nseveral rocks, a “huge” rug, a broken chair, and a saddle. She\nreported she tried to get Foster Parent to get rid of items such as\nthe broken items and rocks and told Foster Parent they would buy\nYouth A a new chair. Foster Parent was adamant that Youth A\nhad a right to her belonging, so everything was loaded into the car\nand brought to Youth A who then proceeded to throw away the\nitems she no longer wanted.

Initially,\nupon placement, Foster Care Worker told Foster Parent she\n5",
    "would get Youth B enrolled in a new school because he could not\ncontinue to attend the same online school he had attended while\nin detention. Foster Care Worker then told her she was trying to\nenroll him in an online school, but that school was in the middle of\ntesting, so she would enroll him at a later date. Foster Parent\nasked again about Youth B attending the same online school as\nhe did while in detention and Foster Care Worker told Foster\nParent, she was certain he could not. After another week had\npassed, Foster Parent called the school Youth B had been\nattending in detention and was told that he could have remained in\nthat school and continued his online classes and all that needed to\nbe done was some paperwork to get him re-enrolled. The day\nFoster Parent was supposed to bring the paperwork to the school\nher car broke down and Foster Care Worker told her she could not\nhelp. Foster Parent stated she found a way to get Youth B and the\npaperwork to the school, which was on a Friday, after which Youth\nB started back at the school the following Monday.\nOn 7/27/2023 Foster Care Worker was interviewed via Microsoft\nTeams.

She stated Foster Care Worker got him enrolled in a\n6",
    "new school when he went to the foster home. Foster Care\nSupervisor was then told Youth B is attending the same school he\nwas attending in detention and could have, in fact, remained\nenrolled at that school the entire time and it was Foster Parent\nwho called the school and got him back in. She was also told\nYouth B was not enrolled in school for at least 3 weeks after\nleaving detention. Foster Care Supervisor responded she did not\nknow any of that information.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nThe following documentation was reviewed in Youth B’s electronic\ncase record:\n• Placement History: Detention 8/24/22-4/11/23\nFoster Parent 4/11/23-5/14/23\nAWOL 5/14/23-current\n• School Enrollment History:\nMuskegon ISD 8/11/2021 – current\nOn 8/16/2023 I received and reviewed a copy of the agency\neducation policy which states youth must be enrolled in school\nwithin 5 school days of placement.\nAnalysis Agency staff did not provide for the enrollment of Youth B within 5\ndays of placement as required per policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404 Placement.\nSection (4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in selecting\nDescription an appropriate placement for a child:\n(c) Expressed preferences of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency risked child safety by ignoring child's request to be moved\nto another placement and threats of cutting and running away.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nOn 7/20/2023 Foster Parent, who is also the Complainant, was\ninterviewed by phone.

Foster Parent stated this was hard on Youth A who\nthen said she wanted to move to a new placement and not did not\nwant to be adopted by Foster Parent. Youth A told Foster Parent\nshe had talked to Foster Care Worker about wanting to be moved\nbut didn’t feel heard. Foster Parent reported that she was sick on\n5/30/2023 and Youth A used that opportunity to run away from the\nhome on her bike. Foster Parent stated Youth A left a note at the\nhome that stated she had run away and if she was brought back\n7",
    "to Foster Parent’s home, she would run again. Foster Care\nWorker found Youth A and brought her to a respite placement for\nthe evening. While at the respite home, she told the respite\nprovider she had been cutting herself. Youth A showed the respite\nprovider where she had been cutting but there were no marks.\nThe following day, 5/31/2023, there was an FTM held which\nFoster Care Worker, Foster Parent, and Youth A’s grandfather\nattended. Foster Parent reported everyone agreed during the\nmeeting that it was not a good safety plan to return Youth A to\nFoster Parent’s home due to her threats to continue to run and\nallegations she had been cutting in the home. Foster Parent\nstated she was contacted by Foster Care Worker the following day\nand was told she would have to take Youth A back for one night\nbecause Youth A had already been in respite too long. Foster\nParent stated she told Foster Care Worker it was not anyone’s\nbest interest for Youth A to return to her home as everyone had\nagreed it was not a safe situation and Foster Parent was\nstruggling with pregnancy related illness. Foster Parent stated\nFoster Care Worker became aggressive and threatened to file a\ncomplaint on the foster family if they refused to take Youth A for\nthe night. Foster Parent stated she felt bullied. Ultimately, Youth A\nwas able to stay with the respite provider before being placed into\nanother home.\nOn 7/27/2023 Foster Care Worker was interviewed via Microsoft\nTeams. She reported Youth A had been with foster parents who\nwere interested in adopting her until they found out the foster\nmother was pregnant and asked for Youth A to be moved without\nnotice on 5/29/2023. Youth A went AWOL the same day. Foster\nParent told Foster Care Worker Youth A had left a note stating\nshe didn’t want to live in the home anymore and Youth A had\nmade threats of self-harm. Foster Care Worker was contacted by\nYouth A’s grandfather who told her where Youth A was after which\nFoster Care Worker and a coworker picked up Youth A. Youth A\nthen told Foster Care Worker, she was frustrated with everything\ngoing on at the foster home and that she had been thinking about\nself-harm while there. She then told Foster Care Worker she had\nbeen cutting her arm and showed Foster Care Worker, but there\nwere no marks. Foster Care Worker reported Foster Parent\nthought it best for Youth A to go to a respite provider due to her\nthreats of self-harm and note stating she would run again if\nreturned to the home. Foster Care Worker stated she felt that was\nreasonable and she was already looking for a new placement. A\nday or two later, an FTM was held during which Foster Care\nWorker told Foster Parent that she would have to take Youth A\nback since Youth A had reached the maximum number of nights\n8",
    "in respite and, per policy, she had 14 days to find a new\nplacement for Youth A. Foster Parent brought up her concerns\nrelated to Youth A’s threats and Foster Care Worker told her the\nfamily had to take her back. Foster Parent told her she was not\nable to provide the required level of supervision due to Foster\nParent being ill, which Foster Care Worker did not understand.\nFoster Care Worker stated she told Foster Parent she would be\nreported for not taking the youth back into her home. Foster Care\nWorker stated that she had previously agreed with Foster Parent\nthat the placement was not in the youth or family’s best interest.\nFoster Care Worker stated that a variance was requested in order\nfor Youth A to be placed back with one of her previous placements\nwho was at capacity. That variance was approved, so Youth A did\nnot have to return to Foster Parent’s home.\nOn 8/1/2023 Foster Care Supervisor was interviewed via Microsoft\nTeams. She stated Youth A had run away using her bike in the\nmorning. Once she was found, she was brought to the office\nwhere she said she was not happy in her placement. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated Foster Parent refused to take Youth A back\nbecause they were concerned about the threats, she had made so\nYouth A was placed in a respite home. After a few days, the youth\nagreed to go back to Foster Parent’s home for one night to avoid\nexceeding the number of allowed days in respite, but Foster\nParent stated she couldn’t provide the level of supervision the\nagency was asking of her to provide for the youth’s safety. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated she believes it was Foster Care Worker\nwho then told the family the agency would call CPS if they would\nnot take Youth A back. Foster Care Supervisor stated she may\nhave said it differently herself but thinks it might be agency policy\nto call CPS if a family will not take a youth back into their home.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nThe following documentation was reviewed in the youth’s\nelectronic case record:\n• Placement History:\nYouth A with Foster Parent from 8/26/2022 to 5/30/2023\n• Case Contact:\no 5/29/2023 Foster Parent gave notice to find new\nplacement for Youth A\no 5/30/2023 – Foster Parent called to report Youth A\nwas AWOL.

Foster Parent told Foster Care\nWorker that her husband was working and Foster\nParent is pregnant and can’t provide 24/7\nsupervision of Youth A.\n• Family Team Meeting Documentation:\n5/31/2023 Documentation stated Youth A was to remain in\nher current placement.\nOn 8/16/2023 Deputy Director sent an email stating that the\nagency does not have a policy requiring staff to call CPS about\nfoster families who refuse to maintain placement or take a youth\nback into their home after AWOL, regardless of circumstance.\nAnalysis Agency staff did not consider the expressed interest of the youth\nwhen contacting the foster parent to threaten them with filing an\nabuse/neglect complaint when they stated they could not continue\nto provide placement for a youth after the youth stated she would\ncontinue to run away from the home and attributed self-harm\nthoughts to circumstances in the home.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nAugust 16, 2023\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 17, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
