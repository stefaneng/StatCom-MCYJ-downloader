    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Rule variance\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12102\nSection • (1) Upon the written request of an applicant or agency, the\nDescription department may grant a variance from an administrative\nrule if the alternative proposed ensures that the health,\ncare, safety, protection, supervision, and needed services\nof children are maintained, and that the alternative aligns\nwith the intent of the administrative rule.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A licensed foster home has been in non-compliance with licensing\nrules since 2022 due to having a 2nd floor bedroom that does not\nhave a floor to ceiling wall or latchable door. A variance was\nrequested and approved however the CPA did not submit a new\nvariance request to document the non-compliance after the\nprevious variance expired.\nInvestigation Licensing worker was interviewed via telephone on June 6,\n2024. She stated the Foster Placement has been licensed since\nJanuary 2021. She stated she has been assigned to the Foster\nPlacement file since January, 2022 and she did not complete the\ninitial home study. She stated when she was initially assigned to\nthe provider record, she was told there was a variance in place\ndue to not having a latchable door on one of the upstairs\nbedrooms. The variance was requested for the duration the Foster\nPlacement license was open and it was her understanding the\nagency had obtained an ongoing approval. In December, 2021\nanother variance was requested due to the number of children in\nthe home. The agency was going to withdraw that variance and\nwithdrew the wall and door variance by mistake. When the\nvariance was re-requested, they were told there could not be an\nongoing approval. It was recommended to use Family Incentive\nGrant (FIG) funding and rectify the issue.\nShe stated the agency struggled to find contractors who were\nwilling to provide a quote for the work due to Foster Placement\nliving in a remote area. Initially, the Licensing Supervisor was\nworking with the Foster Placement to obtain a contractor quote.\nMore recently, the Foster Placement has been contacting\ncontractors and obtaining quotes. It took a while to obtain quotes,\nbut once they these, Licensing Worker sent them to FIG in\nOctober, 2022. FIG provided approval in November, 2022.\n2",
    "Licensing Worker was on maternity leave from November, 2022\nuntil February, 2023 and during that time another worker was\ntemporarily assigned. She attempted to contact the contractor with\nthe lowest quote one time after FIG approval due to going on\nmaternity leave. She spoke to him and had a positive interaction\nand expected the process to move forward. Prior to going on\nmaternity leave she provided all information to her supervisor and\nthe two workers covering while she was on leave. When she\nreturned from maternity leave there were no updates given to her.\nShe stated no one attempted to contact the contractor and the\nvariance had lapsed. She stated she provided a detailed email\nprior to leaving that the variance was set to expire on December\n31, 2022. She was told the workers who were covering were going\nto bring the variance to date and that did not happen. The\nvariance lapsed from December 31, 2022, until April 2023 when\nshe received the case back.\nUpon being reassigned she attempted to resubmit the variance.\nThere were corrections that went back and forth but it was\neventually approved in July 2023. There was a lengthy delay due\nto the contractor not responding to multiple attempts to gather\ninformation/documentation needed to process payment.\nEventually she was given permission from FIG to move on to\nanother contractor that had submitted a quote, and that contractor\nalso did not respond or provide requested information. In October,\n2023 Foster Placement received another quote. The contractor\nindicated he would be interested in completing the work. A quote\nwas submitted to FIG on October 22, 2023, and it was approved\non October 31, 2023. Upon approval the contractor requested a\ndown payment. Licensing Worker contacted FIG on October 31,\n2023, regarding the down payment and they indicated on\nNovember 3, 2023, there was an issue with the proposal that was\nsubmitted because it did not state “invoice”. The contractor was\ncontacted several times and eventually made the change, and it\nwas resubmitted on December 5, 2023. She did not hear back and\non January 3, 2024, she contacted the accounting person in her\noffice and asked if she could look on SIGMA to see if the payment\nwas issued to the contractor. The accounting person was able to\nsee that the 50% payment was issued to the contractor on\nNovember 21, 2023. Upon learning that payment had already\nbeen issued she stated she attempted to contact the contractor\nmultiple times and explained the payment was issued in\nNovember and wanted a status update. The variance expired\nagain in January 2024.\n3",
    "A meeting was held with DCWL Central Office Consultant who\nindicated she would speak with her supervisor to see about\ngetting this approved. She did not hear anything after this. On\nFebruary 7, 2024, licensing worker sent a letter to contractor\nasking for him to contact her with a plan no later than February 27,\n2024. On March 5, 2024, her office received the letter stamped\nreturned mail and a handwritten note that said “does not live here.\nFrom now on mail will go in trash, hasn’t lived here in years”. That\nwas the address contractor used when signing up in SIGMA in\nsummer of 2023, his quote in October 2023 and his invoice after\nthat.\nEventually contact was made with the contractor on March 5,\n2024. He admitted he lives in Indiana and has all along.\nContractor stated he was willing to do the work. He had been paid\napproximately $650 and Licensing Worker pointed out he\naccepted payment, so the work needs to be completed. After this,\nshe was unable to get in contact with him again. On April 19,\n2024, she was advised by her Program Manager to write a letter\nto contractor requesting the money back along with an invoice\nwritten up by the accounting person in their office and there has\nstill been no contact with him. Middle to late March she advised\nFoster Placement to start the process of looking for a contractor\nagain. Foster Placement reported they had contacted several\nother contractors and scheduled appointments, but no one came\nto those appointments.\nLicensing Supervisor was interviewed via Teams on June 7,\n2024. She stated the initial home study was completed in early\n2022. An ongoing variance was approved early on due to an\nupstairs bedroom not having a latchable door but was mistakenly\nclosed. When another variance was requested, the agency was\ntold by DCWL the variance would not be approved as ongoing and\nthere would be an expiration date. The variance had lapsed\neffective December 31, 2022, while Licensing Worker was on\nmaternity leave, and she began working on it once she returned.\nThe worker who covered while Licensing Worker was out had not\ncompleted it as requested. Another variance was requested in\nMay 2023 so there was a lapse during that timeframe.\nLicensing Supervisor stated there is currently not a variance in\nplace. The most recent variance expired on January 8, 2024, and\nanother one was requested and has been pending since January\n2024. She stated the agency and Foster Placement have\nstruggled to find a contractor who is willing to complete the work.\nThe Foster Placement resides in a rural area and there are limited\n4",
    "contractors. Eventually a contractor was found who agreed to\ncomplete the work. A FIG payment was made to a contractor who\nagreed to complete the work. He accepted partial payment but\nhas not completed the work and is not communicating with the\nagency. The agency is working with Central Office to recoup the\nmoney.\nLicensing Supervisor acknowledged the agency could have been\nmore diligent to avoid the variance lapsing. The agency utilizes\noutlook calendars to track due dates. Supervisors maintain a\nspreadsheet for report due dates and each worker must update\ntheir work plan which includes due dates. Each worker has their\nown work plan that they manage, and it is reviewed during\nmonthly supervision. Supervisor takes this information and\nensures there is an outlook calendar entry with due dates.\nLicensing Supervisor was focusing on reports but not variances.\nShe has since created a spreadsheet that includes variance due\ndates and has sent outlook invitations for those due dates.\nDivision of Child Welfare Licensing Central Office Consultant\n(DCWL Central Office Consultant) was interviewed via Teams\non June 17, 2024. She stated the initial variance request came in\nsometime during the foster parent’s initial licensing process. The\nvariance was requested because the home was missing a wall\nand a door in an upstairs bedroom. She said during the initial\nconsult they asked the agency if Foster Placement could complete\nthe work themselves. They were told Foster Placement works\noften, and the work is complicated. She stated DCWL never\napproved an ongoing variance. The variance requests always had\nan end date and the agency continued to request extensions.\nDuring COVID there was discussion regarding a lack of\ncontractors and high costs. The agency has repeatedly stated\nthey are unable to find contractors to complete work.\nShe stated the agency continued to insist the work could not be\ncompleted and explained they have been unable to find a\ncontractor who is willing to complete the work. DCWL advised that\na contractor would need to be the one to make a statement\nindicating the work would not be able to be completed. The\nagency was advised to continue to try and find a contractor. The\nwork was recently completed by Foster Placement. The agency\nsubmitted photos to DCWL Central Office Consultant as\nverification.\nDCWL Central Office Consultant stated DCWL does not track\nopen variances and due dates because there are too many with\n5",
    "different due dates. She stated tracking and ensuring a variance\ndoes not lapse is the responsibility of the agencies.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Foster Placement provider record in CWLM. Special\ninvestigation 2024SEC0001654, intake 6/3/2024\nAllegations: Foster Placement has been in noncompliance\nwith licensing rules since original licensure in 2021 due to a\nbedroom on the 2nd floor not having a latchable door.\nVariances have been requested and lapsed twice.\nInvestigation is pending.\n• 3130 dated 1/12/2021.

The upper level of the home contains\ntwo bedrooms. The first bedroom at the top of the stairs\ndoes not have a latchable door.\nLength of time variance is needed and specific plan (if\napplicable) to resolve non-compliance: The variance is\nneeded for the duration the foster home license is open as\nthe issue cannot be rectified due to the structure and layout\nof the home.

Variance is\nrequested for the duration of the foster home license as the\nissue cannot be rectified due to the structure of the home.\n• Variance approval letter dated 1/20/2021. Letter does not\nlist an expiration date however MISACWIS shows an\nexpiration date of 12/20/2021 on the approval details tab.\n• Variance requested on 4/14/2022, expiring on\n12/31/2022. Rule 9306 (1)(e) Bedrooms. The variance for\nRule 9306(1)(e) was previously approved on 1/19/21 upon\nthe family initially becoming licensed. However, an\nadditional short-term variance was requested on 12/20/21\nfor more than 8 children in a provider home, and this\nvariance was closed in error. This variance is required\nthroughout the duration of the family's license.\n• Plan and Duration to Resolve Variance.\nThe family is agreeable to having contractors come to the\nhome to determine if a wall and door can be added in the\narea upstairs to resolve this concern.

Approval letter could not be\nlocated in CWLM.\nCircumstances Surrounding Non-Compliance: The variance\nfor Rule 9306(1)(e) was previously approved on 1/19/21\nupon the family initially becoming licensed. However, an\nadditional short-term variance was requested on 12/20/21\nfor more than 8 children in a provider home, and this\nvariance was closed in error. This variance is required\nthroughout the duration of the family's license.\nThe family resides in a 6-bedroom cape cod style home.\n7",
    "The upper level of the home contains two bedrooms. The\nfirst bedroom at the top of the stairs does not have a\nlatchable door.\n• Plan and Duration to Resolve Variance: The family is\nagreeable to having a wall and door can be added in the\narea upstairs to resolve this concern. The family reached\nout to contractors and received appropriate quotes for the\nwork. A FIG request was submitted and approved\n10/24/2022, however the work has not yet been completed.\nAssigned worker was on leave and follow up was not\ncompleted during that time. Assigned worker has been in\ncontact with the contractor, but they have not yet provided\nan estimated date of completion for the work. Last contact\nwas made on 06/28/2023. At this time, the contractor has\nnot provided an estimated date of completion for the work\nor an updated quote for FIG. Licensing will continue to work\nwith the family and FIG to find a contractor willing to\ncomplete the project timely. The variance is being\nrequested for six months to obtain additional quotes, obtain\nFIG approval if a new contractor is needed and get the\nproject completed.\nApproval history in CWLM: July 13, 2023, DCWL Director\napproval comment in CWLM: Recommend approve for six\nmonths. The variance for Rule 9306(1)(e) was previously\napprove on 1/19/21 upon the family initially becoming\nlicensed. The family is agreeable to having a wall and door\ncan be added in the area upstairs to resolve the concern.\nThe family reached out to contractors and received\nappropriate quotes for the work. A FIG request was\nsubmitted and approved on 10/24/2022. The contractor has\nstill not provided an estimated completion date. Please\napprove variance for six months to allow time to identify a\nreplacement contractor and update FIG as necessary.\n• Variance requested 1/4/2024, currently pending.\nRule 9306 (1)(a)(d) Bedrooms-has latchable door that\nleads to means of egress.\nCircumstances surrounding non-compliance: The variance\nfor Rule 9306(1)(e) was previously approved on 1/19/21\nupon the family initially becoming licensed. A variance is\nbeing requested for rules 9306 1a and 1d, formerly 1e.\nThere are no issues regarding noncompliance with rule\n9306 1e regarding windows. MDHHS has continued to\nwork with the family to rectify this issue. The family\nobtained quotes which were sent to FIG. A new contractor\nwas approved to complete the work on 10/31/2023. An\ninvoice was obtained from this contractor to pay his\n8",
    "required 50% down. This payment was completed by\naccounting and the contractor is expected to complete this\nproject within the next 90 days. There should not be a\nneed for an additional variance. The family resides in a 6\nbedroom cape cod style home. The upper level of the\nhome contains two bedrooms. The first bedroom at the top\nof the stairs does not have a latchable door.\nPlan & duration to resolve variance: The family is\nagreeable to having a wall and door can be added in the\narea upstairs to resolve this concern. The family reached\nout to contractors and received appropriate quotes for the\nwork. A FIG request was submitted and approved\n10/24/2022, however all contractors submitted on the initial\napproved FIG request failed to maintain contact with\nMDHHS and complete the work quoted. Since the time of\nthe last variance, Licensing has worked with the family to\nidentify additional contractors. The family obtained quotes\nwhich were sent to FIG. A new contractor was approved to\ncomplete the work on 10/31/2023. An invoice was obtained\nfrom this contractor to pay his required 50% down. This\npayment was completed by accounting and the contractor\nis expected to complete this project within the next 90\ndays. There should not be a need for an additional\nvariance.\nHistory of need for variance:\n• Original license issued 1/19/2021\n• Details from initial variance- approved: The variance is\nneeded for the duration the foster home license is open as\nthe issue cannot be rectified due to the structure and\nlayout of the home. The two bedrooms upstairs allow for\nthe children to have privacy as the staircase is located at\nthe back of the home. When looking up the staircase the\nbedroom is not visible as you turn right around the corner\nat the top of the stairs to enter the bedroom. The lack of a\nfull latchable door does not negatively impact the children's\nwellbeing or the foster child.\n• MiSACWIS states that the variance was closed\nDecember 2021 in error\n• Variance approved 04/14-12/31/2022 stating that the\nfamily is agreeable to having contractors come to the\nhome to determine if a wall and door can be added in the\narea upstairs to resolve this concern. The family has\nstarted to reach out to contractors to make an\nappointment. It is requested that this variance be in place\nfor 8 months (until 12/9/22) to allow sufficient time for the\n9",
    "family to get quotes, FIG to be requested and the\nconstruction to be completed.\n• Quotes sent to FIG 10/2022, approved 11/2022. (due to\nremote area, the family struggled to get 2 contractors who\ninitially stated that they were willing to work with us that\nservice their area).\n• Variance lapsed 12/31/22-April 2023.\n• Assigned worker was on maternity leave from November-\nFebruary- which is when the variance lapsed and no\nattempts were made to contact contractors during that\ntime.\n• Worker attempted to reach out to both contractors from\nMarch-September. Needed updated quote due to time\nelapsed and needed them to sign up in SIGMA. Neither\nfollowed through.\n• October 2023, sent a third contractor to the home.\nObtained a quote.\n• November 2023, received FIG approval to utilize this\ncontractor.\n• January 2024- informed that new contractor received\n50% down payment.\n• Awaiting this contractor to do the work to rectify variance.\n• Variance approval history:\nJanuary 18, 2024, DCWL Consultant rejection comment in\nCWLM: The variance for this foster home is being\nrequested until 5/8/24? In the variance narrative it states 90\ndays, why are you requesting until 5/8/24? The length that\nthis has been ongoing is a bit concerning. The director will\nask for an explanation why the additional 30 days on top of\nwhat has already been going on.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance. Based on interviews and\nreview of Foster Placement profile in MISACWIS and CWLM the\nagency did not rectify the non-compliance listed in the variance\nand did not submit a timely request for an extension which\nresulted in the variance lapsing on two occasions.\nConclusion Violation Established\n10",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_____6/18/2024______________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n6/30/2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n11"
