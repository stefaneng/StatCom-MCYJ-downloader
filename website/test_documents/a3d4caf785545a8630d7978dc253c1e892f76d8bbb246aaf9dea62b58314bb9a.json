Staff 1\ndescribed Youth A as being dysregulated, running around the cabin at Quest and\nrefusing to take her medication. Staff 1 reported Youth C said something to Youth\nA, Youth A got upset and threw a lotion bottle at Youth C. Staff 1 said after Youth A\nthrew the lotion bottle, she darted for the cabin door so Staff 2 placed Youth A in a\nrestraint. Staff 1 stated she thinks Youth A and Youth C exchanged more words\nwith one another but was not certain. Staff 1 described Supervisor coming into the\ncabin and switching out Staff 2. Staff 1 stated Supervisor was able to talk with Youth\nA and calm her down. Staff 1 stated she personally would not have placed Youth A\nin a restraint. Staff 1 reported she would have let Youth A go outside because she\nbelieved Youth A was trying to go talk with Supervisor who she is close to.

Staff 2 stated Youth A could not verbalize\nwhat her intentions were and stated again Youth A was being aggressive. Staff 2\n3",
    "was asked to describe what she meant by “aggressive.” Staff 2 described Youth A\nyelling but denied that Youth A was hitting/punching or going after Youth C. Staff 2\nstated she placed Youth A in a restraint because it was late, dark outside and she\nwas not sure what Youth A was going to do. Staff 2 reported there were three staff\noutside, one being Supervisor, who came into the cabin and switched her out from\nthe restraint. Staff 2 reported she felt the restraint was warranted and done properly.\nSupervisor was interviewed via telephone while I was at the facility on September\n21, 2022. Supervisor reported she was outside standing by the fire with two other\nstaff when she heard commotion from inside the cabin. Supervisor stated she\nentered the cabin, saw Staff 2 in a restraint with Youth A and took over the restraint.\nSupervisor reported she continued the restraint for about 15 seconds until Youth A\nbecame calm. Supervisor denied seeing what happened leading up to the restraint.\nSupervisor described talking with Youth A and Staff 2 about the restraint as well as\nreviewing the incident report. Supervisor stated Staff 2 told her Youth A headed\ntoward the door aggressively but did not describe what aggressively looked like.\nSupervisor reported she felt the restraint was warranted due to the situation Staff 2\nwas placed in.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record and Staff 2\ncompleted the required Aegis training on 03/17/22 and 03/18/22.\n• Incident Report 141510196 was not consistent with Staff 1, Staff 2,\nSupervisor or Youth A’s interviews. The incident report did not reflect\nSupervisor was involved in the restraint. Supervisor reported she spoke with\nQuality Assurance about some key points not being in the incident report and\nstruggling to get Wifi while at Quest.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4160 Emergency Restraint\nRule 160. The use of emergency restraint as a lifesaving\nresponse for a youth will be limited to:\n(a) An emergency response to protect the youth or others\nfrom an unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior\nthat places the youth or others at serious threat of\nviolence or injury if no immediate intervention occurs.\n(b) When all other interventions in the agency’s crisis\nprevention and intervention plan and the youth’s\nindividual safety and calming plan have been utilized\nbut fail to protect the youth or others from\nunanticipated or severely aggressive behavior that\nplaces the youth or others at serious threat of violence\nor injury if no immediate intervention occurs.\n4",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is found in non-compliance as Staff 2 placed Youth A\nin a restraint for throwing a lotion bottle at Youth C, then running\ntoward the door and attempting to push past Staff 2. The\nphysical restraint was not warranted.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nPreviously cited as Emergency Rule 3\nSIR2021C0223004 dated 10/26/20, CAP Approved 11/4/20\nPreviously cited as R400.4159\nSIR2022C0128009 dated 1/27/22, CAP Approved 03/01/22\nSIR2022C0114012 dated 2/24/22, CAP Approved 6/10/22\nSIR2021C0114040 dated 1/5/22, CAP Approved 3/02/22\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan no change be\nmade to the license status of this child caring institution.\nSeptember 26, 2022\n_____________________________________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 28, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
