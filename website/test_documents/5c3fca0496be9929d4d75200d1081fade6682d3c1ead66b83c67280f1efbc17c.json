To assess for rule compliance in\nthe area of open residents, a closed record, where the resident had remained in place\nfor fifteen days was also reviewed. The agency received placement of three\nresidents the prior week and another site visit occurred. The chief administrator\nreported one reason for the lower census numbers could be related to referral\nsources being under a fault impression that the facility does not take aggressive\nchildren. He reported the agency has concerns with children who have a history of\naggression with their peer, but not necessarily with aggressive behaviors. The chief\nadministrator is working with referral sources/hospitals to clarify these issues.\nVII.

Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue their regular license.\nFebruary 14, 2019\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 15, 2019\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
