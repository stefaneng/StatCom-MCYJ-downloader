Attempts were made to contact her\nvia telephone on July 15, 2025, and July 23, 2025. Voicemails\nwere left requesting a return call with no response received to\ndate. Email contact was made on July 16, 2025. No response has\nbeen received.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on July 17, 2025. Parent has 6 children in care and\nthere are two different jurisdictions involved, both with the same\nassigned FC supervisor and FCW. FC supervisor stated Parent\nhas a lengthy history of mental health issues. Visits have been\nvery inconsistent throughout the case. There have been short\nperiods of time when Parent exercises her visits and then will go\nfor a long stretch where she does not confirm or communicate\nwith the agency. There have been instances when the agency\ntransports the baby and upon arrival at Parent’s home she will\nstate she doesn’t want to visit today.\nFC supervisor stated the court orders state the agency has\ndiscretion to allow supervised or unsupervised parenting time\nincluding overnights. There was a period when Parent was\nconsistent with visits towards the end of last year and beginning of\nthis year. Due to the consistency at the time the agency shifted\nvisits to be weekend unsupervised. Once that occurred Parent\nparticipated in 2-3 visits and then would not communicate with the\nagency to confirm visits. The agency made every effort to\ncommunicate with her to see if she needed anything and Parent\nwould not respond.\nFC supervisor stated Parent’s biggest barrier is her mental health.\nThe agency has not received confirmation she is attending\ntherapy and taking her prescribed medication in quite some time.\nDue to ongoing mental health concerns and the inconsistency with\nunsupervised parenting time the agency decided it would be best\nto move the visits to supervised. There were also concerns with\nParent’s housing because at one point she reported she would be\n3",
    "losing her housing and the due to lack of contact the agency did\nnot have confirmation she still had appropriate housing. The\nagency reached out to inquire if she needed any resources or\nreferrals to address housing and Parent did not respond. Due to\nnot knowing the current status of her housing and not having a\nreport in 2-3 months regarding parenting time the agency decided\nit wasn’t safe to allow overnight unsupervised visits to continue\nuntil they knew the current status and could ensure child safety. In\naddition, since Parent had been so inconsistent with parenting\ntime the agency had not been able to supervise the required\nmonthly parenting time. FC supervisor stated the agency is\nresponsible for reporting to the court how parenting times are\ngoing and up to this point they haven’t been able to do that due to\nParent’s inconsistency and lack of communication. At the last\ncourt hearing the agency was directed by the court to schedule an\nFTM to discuss parenting time due to the court being concerned\nwith the unsupervised parenting time and Parent’s pattern of\ninconsistency.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nJuly 18, 2025. She stated Parent has two different court cases\ninvolving 2 different counties however she is the assigned FCW\nfor both cases. FCW stated Parent has not been consistent with\nvisits. There has been an ongoing pattern of not confirming visits\nand not communicating with the agency.\nFCW stated visits had been overnight, unsupervised but due to\nthe ongoing concerns with Parent’s mental health and inconsistent\nparenting time the agency moved the visits back to supervised.\nIn addition, FCW stated the agency is not sure the status of\nParent’s housing. Approximately one month ago Parent reported\nshe was unsure if she would be able to maintain her housing due\nto being behind in rent and utilities.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• All court orders from May 2024 through the most recent\ncourt order in May 2025 state the agency has discretion to\nallow unsupervised or supervised parenting time up to and\nincluding overnights.\n• MISCASWIS case file. September 24, 2024-June 18, 2025,\nUSP’s include multiple social work contacts documenting\nFCW attempting to contact Parent to schedule/confirm\nparenting time and not receiving a response.\n• FTM’s to discuss case status. Parent did not attend FTM’s\nheld on May 6, 2025, and June 16, 2025. Parent attended\nFTM held on July 9, 2025.\n4",
    "Analysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews and review of MISACWIS case file the agency has\ndiscretion, per the court order, to provide supervised or\nunsupervised parenting time. The MISACWIS case file includes\nmultiple social work contacts on behalf of FCW to contact Parent\nto schedule/confirm parenting time and the majority of the time no\nresponse is received.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
