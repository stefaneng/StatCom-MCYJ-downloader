The youth are seen in\nthe living area as well as in the hallway and going in and out of\ntheir bedrooms. Staff 1 was supervising the youth, going in and\nout of the staff office, and passing medications. Staff 2 was seen\nsupervising in the living area, hallways, and positioning himself in\na manner where he was able to see both the living area and\nhallways when the youth moved between the two. The video\nfootage shows staff appropriately supervising the youth per the\nEagle Village “Supervision of Residents” procedure.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Eagle Village Supervision of Residents Procedure was\nreviewed on January 8, 2024. The procedure outlines that\nstaff should be aware of youth’s whereabouts at all times,\nhowever, does not require line of sight at all times. If two or\nmore youth are in the hallway it requires staff to position\nthemselves to see the hallway for proper supervision. If a\nyouth goes into the hallway alone to go into their bedroom\nstaff do not need to maintain sight of the hallway but rather\nare required to do complete room checks at irregular\nintervals not to exceed fifteen minutes.\n• Eagle Village Search Procedure was reviewed on January\n8, 2024. The procedure states “Staff should ensure youth\nand/or their belongings are searched when they return to\nthe house after being out of staff supervision”.\n• Eagle Village Safety Procedures was reviewed on January\n9, 2024. The procedure outlines the expectations of staff in\nthe case of a fire. The expectation is for staff to evacuate all\nyouth from the house when they hear a fire alarm, staff to\nreturn to determine if there is a real fire if necessary and\ncall 911 for assistance.\n• Youth A written statement dated January 1, 2024, stating “I\nam the one who burnt down the house. It was peer\npressure. Another youth, [Youth B], came back from his\nhome pass, he gave me a lighter last Thursday. [Youth D],\n[Youth B], and [Youth C] were peer pressuring me. They\nsaid if I didn’t do it, they were going to jump me.”\n• Youth B written statement dated January 1, 2024, stating\n“[Youth A] was the person who lit the house on fire. He had\ngot it from his grandpa and put it in a ball of yarn.”\n• Youth C written statement dated January 1, 2024, stating\n“[Youth A] lit the place on fire and he planned it with his\nlighter at home.”\n5",
    "• Youth D written statement dated January 1, 2024, stating\n“its [Youth A]”.\n• Youth E written statement dated January 1, 2024, stating\n“My name is [Youth E] and I only know some stuff. So\nbasically [Youth A] told me last week that he was going to\nlight the house on fire and that was the last I heard about\nthat.”\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record.\nStaff 1 completed the required Safety Training on June 14,\n2022, and Supervision Training on May 23, 2023.\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record.\nStaff 2 completed the required Safety Training on\nNovember 15, 2023, and Supervision Training on\nNovember 9, 2023.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with Program Statement. The\nstaff completed the appropriate search upon Youth A’s return from\nhis home visit and there is no evidence that the staff were not\nsupervising the youth the night of the fire.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n_____________________________________January 17, 2024\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 18, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
