    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4108 Financing and audit.\nSection (1) A licensee shall do all of the following:\nDescription (c) Demonstrate sufficient financing to assure that proper care of\nresidents is provided and that licensing rules are followed.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The facility is experiencing financial concerns.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via email on 2/13/25.\nComplainant did not have any additional information.\nSenior Auditor (SA) was interviewed via phone on 2/18/25 and\nvia video conference on 4/23/25. SA reported a financial\nconcerns memo is issued for a facility when there’s a trend of\nnegative results (decline in total net assets) two years in a row. SA\nreported short-term liabilities can come due at any time, and the\nfacility must demonstrate they have necessary funds to pay off\ntheir short-term liabilities. SA reported the facility’s financial audit\nshows the facility has a large deficit in working capital in the\namount of a negative $1,802,205. SA noted the prior year’s\nworking capital was a positive $139,414. SA reported considering\nthe facility’s line of credit and mortgage as long-term liabilities\ninstead of short-term liabilities (like they’re documented in the\nfinancial audit report), it reduces the facility’s short-term debt by\nalmost $2 million. SA reported the financial audit report did not\nnote the facility was negotiating their long-term debts, so he was\nunaware of that information. SA reported the financial auditor\nshould have noted that information in the report. SA reported had\nthe facility’s line of credit and mortgage been listed under long-\nterm liabilities instead of short-term liabilities, there would not have\nbeen any concerns noted from MDHHS’ auditing department and\nno memo of financial concerns would have been issued.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 2/18/25. CA reported their fiscal year is from May 1st-\nApril 30th and they’re currently working on a new budget. CA\nreported this is his fourth year as a director and he’s never had to\ncomplete a corrective action plan regarding financial concerns or\nbecause of a financial audit. CA reported the board approves all\nfinances and expenditures. CA reported the facility has never had\nany financial issues regarding providing for or meeting the needs\nof the residents. CA reported the facility is current on all their\ndebts and liabilities. CA reported the per diem rate for youth has\nalmost doubled over the years, so it has helped significantly. CA\n2",
    "reported they’re in a slight deficit for their residential budget\nbecause their expenses have exceeded the money coming in.\nHowever, CA reported they receive donations and funding from\ntheir fund development which assists in covering any deficit they\nhave, so they never end in a deficit.\nFinance Director (FD) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 2/18/25. FD reported working capital is the facility’s\ncurrent assets minus their current liabilities, which is listed as a\nnegative $1.8 million in the memo of financial concerns authored\nby SA. FD reported most of that amount is their mortgage and\ntheir line of credit. FD reported they drew a $700,000 line of credit\ndue to a delay in payments received from their funders, including\nMDHHS. FD reported the presentation of their long-term liabilities\non the financial report changed placement in the report from 2023\nto 2024. For example, in 2023, the facility’s mortgage was\ndocumented under long-term liabilities, but in 2024, the facility’s\nmortgage was documented under current liabilities. FD reported\ntheir mortgage was listed under current liabilities for 2024 financial\naudit report because they were re-negotiating their mortgage\ncontract (which is still ongoing due to an appraisal), and they had\nnot yet received the completed contract. FD reported they should\nreceive the newly approved mortgage contract by April 2025. FD\nreported the mortgage is still considered a long-term liability, but\nbecause the amount was reflected differently on the financial audit\nreport, it negatively affected their working capital. FD reported\nthey issue a financial statement every month, which is reviewed\nand assessed by the executive board monthly, and finance\ncommittee every other month. FD reported they are not behind on\nany debts and would be ahead of financial requirements if they\nwere reimbursed by the State of Michigan timely. For example, as\nof February 2025, the facility still has not received their unfilled\nresidential bed payment from October 2024. FD reported the\nfacility does not have any financial concerns right now and the\nchange in placement of information on the financial audit report\nreflects a change in layout of information due to their current\nmortgage negotiation but does not support financial concerns as\npresented in the memo of financial concerns authored by SA.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Highfields, Inc. Audit Report for Fiscal Year Ended 4/30/24\n(Memo of Financial Concerns) dated 2/12/25 authored by\nSA notes the Compliance Monitoring Unit completed a\nreview of the above-referenced audit report. The memo\nnotes information about the facility’s decline in total net\nassets, working capital, current ratio, and operating loss.\n3",
    "The most relevant information is related to the facility’s\nworking capital, which is documented to be a negative\n$1,802,205. Negative working capital generally indicates\nand agency’s inability to pay off its short-term liabilities if\nthey came due immediately. Prior year working capital was\na positive $139,414.\n• Highfields, Inc. Report on Financial Statements (with\nsupplementary information) dated 7/22/24 (Financial Audit\nReport). Page 4 of the report notes there are no long-term\ndebts for the facility in 2024 and lists all liabilities/debts\nunder “Current Liabilities”. This information is also\ndocumented on page 20 of the Financial Audit report. Both\npages note the facility had long-term liabilities in 2023. The\nFinancial Audit report did not note any financial concerns\nfor the facility and did not require a corrective action plan.\n• Letter to Highfields, Inc. authored by Dart Bank dated\n1/30/25 outlines the terms and conditions discussed\nregarding renewing the existing maturing mortgage loan for\nthe facility’s commercial mortgage loan.\n• Corporate Resolution to Borrow/Grant\nCollateral/Subordinate Debt authored by The Dart Bank\nnotes the facility’s mortgage loan was established on\n3/31/25 and matures on 4/5/30.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance as per interviews conducted\nand documentation reviewed, the mortgage loan has been\nofficially established, which puts the mortgage amount under long-\nterm liabilities instead of short-term liabilities, which in turn means\nthe facility no longer has a negative working capital. There are no\nconcerns regarding the facility’s ability to meet the needs of the\nresidential program and youth in the program.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 24, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 1, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
