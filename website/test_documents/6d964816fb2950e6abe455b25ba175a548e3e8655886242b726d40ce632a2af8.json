Calls were made at the\nagreed upon time, but she did not answer on 10/6/2023 or\n10/10/2023. Parent A did return the missed call on 10/10/2023\nand left a voicemail stating she was available the remainder of the\nday. A return call was made within 30 minutes, but she did not\nanswer. On 10/11/2023 Parent A sent an email requesting\ninterview availability for that day which was provided to her along\nwith a request for her to call when she was available. She has not\nresponded.\nThe only available information from the complainant is what she\nwrote in her online compliant which stated the following:\nWe are never informed of doctors or dentist appointment,\nso we have been unable to attend. The few times we have\nbeen notified of the appointment we are told the day before\nor the day of, or we are given a day but no time of the\nappointment.\nWe have had literally only 1 family team meeting the entire\nduration of the children in care and I had to request it\nmultiple times.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported she supervised Foster Care Worker 1\n2",
    "who was assigned the case from 10/27/2021 until 12/16/2021 and\nFoster Care Worker 2 who was assigned to the case 12/16/2021\nuntil 5/27/2022, neither of which are currently employed by the\nagency. Supervisor 1 reported during the time she was the\nsupervisor assigned to the case, the parents had retained an\nattorney and insisted that all communication from the agency go\nthrough the attorney. Supervisor 1 stated there was a Family\nTeam Meeting (FTM) held in March of 2022 at the attorney’s\noffice, during which the parents were notified of multiple upcoming\nmedical appointments for the children, particularly Youth B who\nhad specialist appointments.\nSupervisor 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. He reported supervising Foster Care Worker 3 who\nwas assigned the case from 5/27/2022 until 9/30/2022 and who is\nno longer employed by the agency. Supervisor 2 reported that\nsocial work contacts in the case record document that Foster Care\nWorker 3 notified parents of medical appointments while he was\nassigned to the case. Supervisor 2 reported Foster Care Worker 3\nheld an FTM with the family during which service planning was\ndiscussed.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported supervising Foster Care Worker 4 who\nwas assigned the case from 9/30/2022 until 6/23/2023 and Foster\nCare Worker 5, who was assigned the case 6/23/2023 and is\ncurrently assigned to the case. Supervisor 3 reported that the\ncase record contains multiple social work contacts documenting\nthe workers’ attempts to notify the parents of medical\nappointment. She stated contact with the parents is difficult\nbecause they will only respond to text or email and will often only\nrespond to a portion of what was addressed in emails.\nSupervisor 3 reported Foster Care Worker 4 attempted to\ncoordinate an endocrinologist appointment for Youth B with the\nparents, but this was difficult due to the foster parents needing to\nbe in attendance as well, and the foster parents have a PPO\nagainst the parents. Supervisor 3 reported the parents did attend\na well-child appointment for Youth B in July of this year.\nSupervisor 3 stated the parents did not attend a medical\nappointment for Youth D and Youth E, despite being notified. She\nstated the parents are primarily concerned with Youth B’s medical\nappointments.\nSupervisor 3 reported Parent A and Parent B have attended 3-4\nFTMs that she is aware of and have been invited to others they\n3",
    "did not attend. She stated the current worker had difficulty\nscheduling meeting with the parents due to their lack of response,\nat times. Supervisor 3 stated Foster Care Worker 5 recently\nscheduled a Team Decision Making meeting, which is the\nequivalent of an FTM, with a neutral facilitator. Foster Care\nWorker 5 sent reminders to the parents before the meeting, but\nneither parent showed up to the meeting and did not let the worker\nknow until after the meeting they couldn’t attend. Supervisor 3\nreported the parents have stated they have lost and broken\nphones during the case, which has prevented them from\nconnecting to virtual meetings. The agency has provided them\nwith a phone and data plan to ensure they do not have access\nbarriers; however, they continue to not attend.\nFoster Care Worker 4 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported she notified the parents of a 7/10/2023\nmedical appointment for Youth B. She stated she also notified\nthem of a medical appointment for Youth D and Youth E but\nacknowledged this notification did occur the same day as the\nappointment as there was confusion with the foster parents about\nthe appointment date. Foster Care Worker 4 stated she couldn’t\nrecall if there were medical appointments for Youth A and Youth C\nwhile they were assigned the case. She added the parents would\nask frequently about Youth B’s medical appointments but did not\nask about the other youth. Foster Care Worker 4 stated she\nnotified the parents of medical appointments by phone or by text.\nFoster Care Worker 5 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported she was assigned the case on 6/26/2023\nand is currently assigned to the case. She stated the children\nhave had several medical appointments since she has been\nassigned to the case and she has notified the parents of every\nappointment either by phone or text, but she rarely gets a\nresponse. She stated Parent B did attend an endocrinologist\nappointment for Youth B which Foster Care Worker 4 also\nattended.\nFoster Care Worker 5 reported she attempted to schedule a TDM\nwith the parents and sent an email to Parent A with the meeting\ndetails. Parent A indicated there was a barrier accessing the\nvirtual meeting, so the facilitator attempted to call Parent A at her\nphone number as well as her mother’s number but did not get a\nresponse.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n4",
    "• The agency’s foster care procedure regarding health\nservices which states parental inclusion in all child’s health\ncare appointments is to be encouraged and supported and\ncaseworkers are to notify parents of all health care\nappointments.\n• The agency’s policy regarding FTMs/TDMs which states all\nmembers of the treatment team are invited to the FTMs.\n• Email from Supervisor 3 to Parent A on 5/3/2023 with\n7/10/2023 medical appointment date time and location.\n• Notes from endocrinologist appointment for Youth B in July\n2023 documenting Parent B’s attendance.\n• FTM documentation from 3/9/2023 and 4/19/2023 during\nwhich upcoming medical appointments were discussed.\nBoth parents signed the FTM paperwork verifying their\nattendance and participation.\n• Social work contacts documenting that the parents were\nnotified of upcoming medical appointments on 1/25/22,\n3/1/2022, 4/11/2022, 6/14/2023, 7/14/2023 and 10/31/2023.\n• 16 FTMs documented to have been held, 4 of which Parent\nA attended and 2 of which Parent B attended. The parents\nsigned the FTM documentation verifying their attendance\nand participation in these meetings. Social work contacts\nwere located for every FTM documenting the parents were\ninvited.\nAnalysis The agency staff followed agency procedures by notifying the\nparents of medical appointments and inviting parents to FTMs.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of Service Plans\nSection (2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each child\nDescription and parent, or parents as follows:\n(b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial removal and at least\nevery 90 calendar days thereafter.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not complete all required service plans.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nPhone interviews were scheduled with Parent A; however, she\ndid not answer at any of the times scheduled.\nThe only available information is what she wrote in her initial\nonline compliant which stated:\n5",
    "I received the case service plans for every reporting period\nfor the first time. There was not a Parent Agency Treatment\nReport from the whole duration of June 2022 to September\n2022, when Foster Care Worker 3 was our caseworker, nor\nwas there a single document from when Foster Care orker\n2 was our caseworker from January 2022 to June 2022.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported what she believes Parent A is\nreferencing in this complaint is that when she requested copies of\nall of her service plans from the agency, the person who provided\nthe copies missed one PATP and one service plan and PATP.\nParent A contacted the agency about this, and those reports were\nsent to her.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n• The electronic case record was reviewed which contains an\ninitial service plan and 5 updated service plans which are\nall of the required service plans.\nAnalysis The agency staff completed all of the required service plans.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\nSection (5) An agency shall involve the parent or parents and the foster\nDescription parents in the development of service plans to enable the parent\nor parents and the foster parents to understand the plan for the\nchild and the parents’ and foster parent’s role in assisting the\nagency in carrying out the plan. An agency shall give a copy to\nand review the parent agency treatment plan with the parent or\nparents and foster parents. The agency must inform the parent or\nparents and foster parents that the information in the parent\nagency treatment plan and any other information about the child\nand the child’s family is confidential.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not involve parents in service plan development and\ndid not review the completed service plans with the parents.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nPhone interviews were scheduled with Parent A; however, she\ndid not answer at any of the times scheduled.\nThe only available information is what she wrote in her initial\nonline complaint which stated the following:\n6",
    "We have never been included in the development of our\ncase services plan nor has a parent agency treatment plan\nbeen gone over with us. We have never received an initial\ncase service plan, nor the first updated case service plan.\nEvery service they claim they have offered has not\noccurred other than substance abuse and drug screens.\nWe started requesting family therapy when we started to\nsee what this has been doing to our family and we finally\nwere given information on how to start those services within\nthe past 2 months. The same with Parent B’s anger\nmanagement. We all are aware that Parent B has a little\ntemper problem. It’s not as if he just lashes out, no, he is\njust unable to express himself professionally or in a\nproductive manner when he’s upset. He doesn’t damage\nthings or threaten harm in any way. However, we felt it may\nbe a barrier, so we inquired about anger management\nservices in April of 2022, yet he was just given the\ninformation for this service in August of 2023. We are not\noffered parenting skill classes or anything of that nature.\nHowever, reports state we need to acknowledge our\nharmful ways of parenting we have previously displayed\nand how it effects our children. In reality, the agency’s\ncaseworker needs to acknowledge the actions they have\ndisplayed and the effects it is having on my children.\nRather, we are made out to look dangerous and crazy by\nthe caseworkers and supervisors at the agency.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported the case service plan and parent agency\ntreatment plan were reviewed with the parents during an FTM that\noccurred at the parents’ attorney’s office at which time the parents\nstated they wanted to write their own treatment plan. Supervisor 1\nstated both parents were referred to BRISA which is a program in\nwhich the parents and children receive trauma assessments from\nwhich a tailored, trauma-informed plan of treatment is developed.\nSupervisor 1 stated that the parents would have received parent\neducation and substance abuse treatment through the program.\nSupervisor 1 stated that she knows the trauma assessments were\ncompleted, but the case was transferred to a different supervisor,\nso she doesn’t know if the parents followed through on the\nservices. Supervisor 1 reported Parent A was also referred for a\nsubstance abuse assessment during an FTM at her attorney’s\noffice after Youth D and Youth E were born with\nMethamphetamine in their system. During that FTM, Parent A\nagreed to the assessment.\n7",
    "Supervisor 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023.He reported Foster Care Worker 3 held an FTM with\nthe parents during which he discussed the case service plan and\nreviewed the PATP. Supervisor 2 stated the parents had not yet\nbeen adjudicated at the time he supervised the case; so,\nparticipation in services was not required; however, they were\nreferred to substance abuse treatment and parenting skills\nclasses. Foster Care Worker 3 also attempted to complete drug\ntests with the parents, but they refused to participate in the testing\nor services.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. Supervisor 3 reported Foster Care Worker 4 met with\nthe parents at least twice and attempted to go over the service\nplan and PATP. Supervisor 3 attended a meeting along with\nFoster Care Worker 4 attempting to discuss service plan\ndevelopment; however, the parents did not engage in the\ndiscussion, rather they focused on their belief that the children\nshould never have been removed and their belief that the court is\nnot acting properly.\nSupervisor 3 stated the parents push back on any services to\nwhich they are referred. Both parents were referred for\npsychological testing to occur on 3/13/2023 but they refused to\nattend. The parents state they will not participate in services until\nsomeone provides proof that they did anything to facilitate the\nremoval of their children. Initially, they stated they wouldn’t\nparticipate in services until they were adjudicated but continued to\nrefuse services after adjudication on 5/9/2023. Supervisor 3 stated\nthat the one service the parents have requested is family therapy;\nhowever, they will not engage in individual therapy which is\nneeded to address the trauma both they and the children have\nendured prior to engaging in family therapy. Supervisor 3 stated\nParent B did ask about anger management services in April or\nMay of this year. Foster Care Worker 4 identified a service for him\nand offered to make the call to set up the service with him, but it\nwasn’t until after the next court hearing in September of 2023 that\nhe agreed to the service.\nFoster Care Worker 4 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported during her first meeting with the parents\nafter being assigned the case she planned to discuss service\nplanning; however, the parents had 5 binders of information they\nwent through regarding their rights, the legal process, and reasons\nwhy they believed the children shouldn’t be in foster care. Foster\n8",
    "Care Worker 4 scheduled another meeting with them since they\ndid not get to the service plan discussion. She went over their\nPATP with them, which they refused to sign, stating they wanted\nto create their own treatment plan.\nFoster Care Worker 4 reported she referred Parent B to the\nDisability Network and offered to make the call with Parent B, but\nhe said he would make the call on his own. Foster Care Worker 4\ndoes not know if he followed through. She stated Parent B initially\nstated he would not engage in anger management services to\nwhich he was referred, but later said he would. Parent A was\nasking Foster Care Worker 4 about family therapy, but a referral\nwas not made as Parent A refused to first engage in individual\ntherapy. Foster Care Worker reported she attempted multiple drug\nscreens for both parents, which they refused.\nFoster Care Worker 5 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported she was assigned the case on 6/26/2023\nand is currently assigned to the case. She reported she scheduled\na meeting with the parents to go over their service plan and PATP.\nShe stated she went through the PATP line by line with Parent B\nand he wanted a lot removed from the report. She stated Parent A\nwas not present for the meeting so Foster Care Worker 5 made an\nappointment with her for the following week, but while she was on\nher way to the home, Parent B called and cancelled.\nFoster Care Worker 5 reported when she did have a face-to-face\nmeeting with Parent A to discuss service referrals, but the majority\nof the visit was Parent A wanting to review policy and Foster Care\nWorker 5 had to continually circle back to discussion of services.\nParent A stated someone needs to prove she has a substance\nabuse problem before she will engage in services. Foster Care\nWorker 5 stated Parent B did not attend that meeting because he\nwas afraid of becoming escalated.\nFoster Care Worker 5 stated she provided Parent A a referral to\nindividual counseling, but Parent A stated she did not want to use\nthat service as it was affiliated with the foster care agency, so she\nwould find someone on her own. Foster Care Worker 5 stated she\nhasn’t heard anything from Parent A about this in the past few\nmonths. Foster Care Worker 5 stated she made a call with Parent\nB to start anger management services, but when he went to start\nthe service, the service provider reported there was an issue with\npayment. Foster Care Worker 5 states she made the full payment\nfor the 12-week course yesterday and Parent B was to start the\nservice tomorrow.\n9",
    "Foster Care Worker 5 reported if the parents had engaged in\nBRISA, they would have received all-inclusive services. She\nstated since adjudication, the parents only want to talk about the\nillegal removal of their children, rather than what they need to do\ntoward getting them back in their home. She stated there was\nrecently a foster care review board meeting and when Parent A\nwas given the opportunity to speak, she began talking about the\nillegal removal. When someone form the board redirected her and\nasked her to talk about services, Parent A dropped off the call.\nShe later reported she had dropped her phone in a pond.\nFoster Care Worker 5 reported the parents recently agreed to\nwork with Early On for parenting skills. The frequency of those\nmeetings with be up to the parents. Foster Care Worker 5 stated\nthere are concerns because they deny Youth D’s developmental\nissues resulting from methamphetamine exposure.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n• Six service plans were reviewed in the case records, which\ndocumented the services were referred as described during\nthe Supervisor and Foster Care Worker interviews.\n• Six PATPs were reviewed, one of which was the Initial\nService Plan the complainant alleged she never received,\nwhich was signed by both parents (11/5/2021) and one of\nwhich was signed by Parent B only (5/31/2023.) The\nremaining PATPs were documented to have been provided\nto the parents either in person or by mail and the parents\nrefused to sign them.\n• 16 FTMs documented to have been held during which all of\nthe services the workers and supervisors mentioned during\ntheir interviews (including parenting skills, substance\nabuse, psychological testing, anger management, and\nindividual counseling) and case service planning was\ndiscussed, 4 of which Parent A attended and 2 of which\nParent B attended. The parents signed the FTM\ndocumentation verifying their attendance and participation\nin these meetings.\n• Case contacts documented that at least monthly face to\nface service discussions as well as multiple text\nmessage/phone/email discussions were held during which\nservice referrals were made service plan discussion was\nattempted, and/or an update on service participation was\nrequested.\n10",
    "Analysis The agency staff discussed service planning with the parents on\nmultiple occasions, provided multiple referrals to services, and\nprovided the parents with the service plans.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12315 Communication\nSection An agency’s communication policy must ensure that a child is able\nDescription to communicate with family and friends in a manner consistent\nwith the child’s expressed wished, appropriate to the child’s\nfunctioning and in accordance with the child’s treatment plan.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency has not facilitated any contact between the youth and their\nrelatives.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nPhone interviews were scheduled with Parent A; however, she\ndid not answer at any of the times scheduled.\nThe only available information is what was written in the initial\nonline complain which states:\nNo Family members have gotten to see the children this\nentire duration in care. When we inquire with caseworkers\nat the agency, they tip toe around the subject until its\nforgotten until we mention it again.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported while she was assigned as supervisor on\nthe case, there were no requests made by relatives to have\ncontact with the children nor have the parents requested or\ndiscussed having family members attend parenting time.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\n• Social Work contact dated 12/3/2021 documenting a\nconversation with Parent A regarding a call received from\nParent B’s grandmother requesting visits with the youths.\nParent A stated she did not want Parent B’s grandmother to\nhave contact with the children.\n• 2/25/2022 text from Parent A stating she has no family\nmembers in Michigan other than her mother with whom she\nlives.\n• Case contacts with Parent A were reviewed, including text\nmessages and emails from Parent A, none of which\n11",

We have not\nbeen told why this happened nor was there an order on the\nmatter. Parent B had been refused to see his children by\nthe agency’s caseworkers for 6 months; telling him he\nneeded to sign an affidavit of parentage before he was\nallowed to see his children regardless the damage done on\neither Parent B or the children. Signing the affidavit took\nlonger than expected however it was done for all 3 children\nApril 5, 2022, which Foster Care Worker 3 was aware of.\nWe informed her and provided her with copies. We had a\nvisit on this day, and it is reported in the parenting time\nreport about Parent B attending the first visit since October\nand about him signing the affidavit that day.\nFoster Care Worker 3 told us he was forced by Supervisor\n2 to sign a motion that he didn’t write. It was a motion to\nsuspend parenting time filed August 16, 2022. The court\nthen adjourned this hearing just as they have the entire\nduration of the case, they adjourn EVERY hearing,\nhowever they still suspended our parenting time to the\n12",
    "children without any information or proof to suspend it. The\nreason they adjourned it to begin with was to gain more\ninformation in regard to suspending parenting time. So how\ndo they suspend parenting time anyway? However, referee\ndid state for there to be some kind of virtual parenting time\nin the meantime to replace in person. I begged and pleaded\nwith caseworkers to let me speak to my children.\nOur next caseworker, Foster Care Worker 5, didn’t contact\nus until October 14, 2021. I asked her so many times for\nany kind of contact; that we would be happy with a phone\ncall. I asked about talking to them on holidays, as this\nduration of parenting time being suspended was of course\nholiday season of November and December. The motion\nwas withdrawn January 3, 2023. Parenting time was\nbasically suspended for that time with no basis or\nreasoning behind it only for the motion to be withdrawn\nrandomly as well. A visit was set up for us and the children\non January 3, 2023, however Parent B and I had difficulties\nmaking it there on the day short notice. Our vehicle was not\nlegal as well and we had a difficult time getting around at\nthis time. We were not offered any transportation\nassistance and we were unable to make this visit.\nAfterward I attempted multiple times a week to set up a\ndifferent day for a visit or to have a virtual. I also begged\nand inquired on why the visit couldn’t be conducted at our\nhome. This was when I started to contact supervisors of the\nagency. They finally set up a visit for all of us March 15,\n2023. They would make us conduct our visits in their\nmeeting room due to the size of the group. 5 children, their\nfather and me, and the agency had 2 workers in the room\nwith us supervising.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported when she was the supervisor on the\ncase, visits were occurring at Parent A’s mother’s home which is\nwhere Parent A and Parent B live. Supervisor 1 stated that she\nmade the decision to move the visits to the agency office on\n3/9/2022 after safety concerns for the children and the agency\nstaff supervising the visits arose. Supervisor 1 stated that there\nwere holes in the walls of the home in which birds would fly in and\nout, the family refused to wear masks or use hand sanitizer at the\nagency request and would have other people show up to the visits\nwho would become argumentative with the agency staff during the\nvisits.\n13",
    "Supervisor 1 stated that Parent B had asked for parenting time,\nbut the court denied the request because he was not established\nas the legal father of the children. After some time, he established\npaternity of Youth D and Youth E and at a later date did the same\nfor Youth B and Youth C. He also signed an affidavit of parentage\nfor Youth B, which caused some confusion at the court as Youth B\nhas a different legal father, resulting in additional time for the court\nto sort out the confusion. After Parent B was established as the\nfather of Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, and Youth E, parental visits\nwere ordered and subsequently scheduled.\nSupervisor 2 reported Parent A and Parent B abducted Youth A\nand Youth C from their foster home on 8/4/2022. They were\nlocated by law enforcement the following day and returned to the\nfoster parents. Parent A was arrested and charged with felony\nkidnapping and Parent B was released.

Supervisor 2 stated that parental visitation was still\nsuspended by the court at the time the case transferred from\nSupervisor 2 to Supervisor 3.\nSupervisor 3 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported when she was assigned as the\nsupervisor on the case, parenting time had already been\nsuspended due to the parents kidnapping Youth A and Youth C.\nShe reported that the order did not allow for phone calls or virtual\nparenting time either. She stated Foster Care Worker 4 did send\nphotos of the children to the parents during the holidays. She\nreported the court reinstated parenting time 12/27/2023. Parenting\ntime was scheduled for 1/3/2023 but the parents did not show up,\nstating they had transportation issues. Supervisor 3 stated the\nparents did not ask for transportation on the day, but the agency\nhas provided them with gas cards and offered to pay for their van\nto be repaired. Supervisor 3 stated neither parent attended\nscheduled parenting times between January and March of 2023.\nShe stated Youth A and Youth C are transported 45 minutes to\nattend parenting time, so the court ordered the parents are\nrequired to confirm their attendance and arrive early for their\nparenting time to ensure the children aren’t traveling to and from\nthe agency if the visit isn’t going to occur. Supervisor 3 stated that\nthe early arrival time did change as the agency was initially\n14",
    "requiring the parents to arrive 2 hours early but realized that was\nexcessive and, in an order, to work with the parents, they reduced\nthe early arrival. The court reduced the time they had to arrive\neven further down to 30 minutes. Supervisor 3 stated there have\nbeen times the parents will call saying they will not make it in time\nfor their early arrival for various reasons. When asked for an\nestimated time of arrival, they stop communicating, so a decision\nis eventually made to cancel the visit. Supervisor 3 stated in these\ncases the parents do not typically show up, but this scenario did\noccur recently, and the parents showed up after the visit was\ncancelled. Supervisor 3 reported Foster Care 4 made several\nattempts to schedule virtual parenting time with the parents if they\nwere unable to attend.\nSupervisor 3 reported that visits have not occurred at the parents’\nhome since parenting time was reinstated following the\nkidnapping. She stated Parent B will harp on Youth B about his\ndiabetes during visits and will whisper negative things about the\nfoster parents and foster care worker to the children during\nvisitation, so there are times when intervention is needed during\nparenting time. In these cases, Parent B becomes escalated and\nagency staff have required police intervention in order to get him\nto leave the agency.\nFoster Care Worker 4 was interviewed via video conferencing on\n10/3/2023. She reported parenting time was suspended when she\nwas initially assigned the case due to the kidnapping. She\nreported visits were reinstated by the court in December of 2022\nafter which a visit was scheduled; however, the parents did not\nattend.

She reported that the\nparents have a hard time accepting and complying with court\norders which has resulted in several cancelled visits. She stated\nParent B has demonstrated out of control behavior during visits\nwhich Parent B cannot deescalate and presents a safety concern\nfor staff member potentially supervising visits in the parents’ home\nwhich is located in secluded area.
