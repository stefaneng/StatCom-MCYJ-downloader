CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following area:\n Special Evaluations- consultation was provided to the licensing supervisor\nand worker regarding an open special evaluation (SE). The SE remains open\nafter several months due to the involvement of law enforcement (LE). The\nagency has completed the required extensions for completion of the SE. The\nagency was advised to keep the SE open until they receive findings from LE,\nas it could make a significant impact on licensing findings.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP, approved 10/28/2021, was developed after the 10/15/2021 interim review.\nThe CAP addressed violations about providing the Independent Living (IL) program\nstatement and policy/procedures to youth, supervision of IL youth, timeliness of\naction summaries, and timely entry of case contacts. During the current review\nperiod, two repeat violations were established. Both repeat violations were contract\n5",

The agency demonstrated successful\nimplementation of the CAP regarding IL policy/rules.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was reviewed and discussed on-site. The Chief\nAdministrator (CA) reported there was staff changes during this review period,\nincluding two supervisors. The agency reported having an otherwise stable team,\nwith few vacancies. The CA further reported they continue to struggle with locating\nplacements at times, due to the state-wide placement crisis. Many youth are in need\nof residential treatment, but options are limited. Regarding the CAP from the 2021\nreview, the CA reported successful implementation and improvement regarding IL\nfiles. Implementation occurred through case reviews, focus on placement change\ndocuments, peer reviews, mini-audits, and engagement of all staff in CAP\ncompliance. The agency continues these practices and will roll in any actions steps\nfrom the CAP developed after this review.\nInterviews\nInterviews were completed on-site with two staff: one foster care and one licensing.\nBoth staff reported feeling supported by the agency. Both staff indicated they have\nhelpful, organized, and knowledgeable supervisors, and manageable caseloads.\nStaff reported difficulty with finding placements at times. However, that is a known,\nstate-wide issue. Otherwise, neither staff had any concerns or ideas for\nimprovement.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued\na renewal of their regular license.\n_ _____________September 16, 2022__________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 16, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
