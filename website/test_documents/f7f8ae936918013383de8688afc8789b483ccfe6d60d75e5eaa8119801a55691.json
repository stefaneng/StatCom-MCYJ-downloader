INVESTIGATION\nRule Code License recommendation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325\nSection (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the appropriate\nDescription licensing action consistent with facts contained in the foster home\nevaluation and any special evaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency completed a special evaluation which determined a\nfoster home was in compliance with licensing rules, although the\nfoster home allowed a youth to restrain another youth, violating\nfoster home licensing rule 400.9404.\nInvestigation On 2/14/24 Complainant reported the agency completed a special\nevaluation for a foster home and did not cite a violation, although\none was documented. Complainant provided a copy of the special\nevaluation report and noted the report verified Foster Parent and\nYouth B (age 15) restrained Youth A (age 6) on her bed.\nComplainant indicated per Public Act 116, restraint of a foster\nchild is not permitted. Therefore, the agency should have found\nFoster Parent in violation of rule R 400.9404 (4).\nOn 2/14/24 Complainant was contacted via email for\nadditional information. Per Complainant, the special evaluation\nreport indicated Foster Parent was advised by Foster Care Worker\nthat restraint with Youth A was appropriate. Foster Care Worker\nwas employed with another agency, as this was a borrowed bed\nsituation.\nOn 2/15/24 Chief Administrator was contacted by phone, but\nout of the office. A follow-up email was sent to Chief\nAdministrator and Program Manager to provide information about\n2",
    "the allegation and investigation process. Program Manager\nresponded with information to schedule interviews with staff.\nOn 3/6/24 Chief Administrator and Program Manager were\ninformed of the preliminary findings of the investigation.\nOn 2/16/24 a joint interview with Licensing Supervisor and\nLicensing Worker 1 occurred via Teams. Both staff reported\nFoster Parent accepted placement of Youth A in order to reunify\nsiblings in her home. Youth A is Youth B’s sister. Licensing\nSupervisor reported this is a borrowed bed situation and Youth A’s\nworker is with another agency. Regarding the special evaluation\nboth staff stated they did not feel the incident was a “restraint” as it\nwas not being used as discipline. Both staff indicated they did not\nbelieve it was a licensing rule violation as it was physical\nintervention to keep a child safe, as allowed by rules. Licensing\nWorker 1 stated she was new to licensing and may have used the\nword “restraint” when she meant something different. Licensing\nWorker 1 reported she saw the video and described it as a hold,\nusing some pressure, in order to keep the child safe. Licensing\nWorker 1 stated the restraint was initiated as Youth A had tried to\njump out a window and was banging her head, trying to harm\nherself. Foster Parent was able to get Youth A to lay on her\nmattress, while Youth B put his hands on Youth A’s arms to sooth\nher. Foster Parent had her hands on Youth B’s legs, in a soothing\nway. It did not appear they were holding Youth A down, as she\nwas able to move her body. Licensing Worker 1 reported Youth\nA’s worker (Foster Care Worker) told Foster Parent it was ok to\nhave Youth B assist in the hold as Youth A felt comforted by him.\nLicensing Worker 1 believed there was no violation as the hold\nseemed reasonable to ensure safety and followed the plan set by\nFoster Care Worker. Licensing Supervisor asked if having a\nsibling assist to comfort a child was a violation. DCWL explained\nthat children cannot assist in restraining another child. Licensing\nSupervisor asked for clarification about “restraint” as the rules\nstate a brief hold is acceptable intervention. Licensing Supervisor\nasked to have some gray areas of the rule clarified as Foster\nParent was interested in maintaining placement but needed\ninformation to stay in compliance when addressing Youth A’s self-\nharming behavior. Agency was advised to use tools available such\nas the Technical Assistance manual, definitions in Public Act 116,\nor consulting with DCWL about any situations in which they were\nunsure.\nOn 2/16/24 a follow-up email was sent to Licensing Supervisor\nand Licensing Worker 1, asking for clarification about the\nstatement that Foster Parent “got her (Youth A) to” lay on the\n3",
    "mattress. Licensing Worker 1 responded that Foster Parent\ngrabbed Youth A by her hips and “shifted her down” to the\nmattress.\nOn 2/20/24 Foster Care Worker was interviewed via phone.\nPrior to the interview, Foster Care Worker (FCW) was contacted\nvia email on 2/26/24 and confirmed there was not a written safety\nplan regarding physical intervention in Youth A’s case record.\nDuring the interview, FCW stated she believed Foster Parent had\nthe type of license that allowed her to restrain youth. FCW was\ninformed by DCWL there is not a license type that allows restraint.\nWhen asked if Youth A’s safety plan allowed for Foster Parent and\nYouth B to restrain her, FCW stated that Youth B is good at\ncalming down Youth A. FCW saw the video of the restraint and felt\nYouth B was not holding Youth A down hard. Youth A did not have\nany marks or bruises. FCW asked Youth A about the restraint\nlater and she reported she was not hurt. When asked to clarify the\nhold, FCW stated Youth A was forcefully trying to get up, but she\nwas unable to as Youth B was holding her arms and Foster Parent\nwas holding her legs. FCW stated there was not a written plan for\nthat type of restraint. However, FCW admitted she did verbally tell\nFoster Parent that it was ok for Youth B to help hold Youth A\ndown. FCW stated she was aware Foster Parent tried,\nunsuccessfully, to calm and soothe Youth A prior to the restraint.\nHowever, Youth A continued to escalate, and Foster Parent was\nconcerned for her physical safety. FCW reported she was\ncompleting this interview while at the hospital with Youth A. Youth\nA was completing a screening due to her self-harming behaviors.\nFCW was unsure if Youth A would be admitted or return to Foster\nParent’s home. It was discussed that restraint was not permitted\nand that a written safety plan was needed if Youth A returned to\nthe foster home.\nOn 2/26/24 FCW was provided with resources about DHHS\nClinical Review, as Youth A may be a candidate for that service.\nOn 2/22/24 Licensing Supervisor and Licensing Worker 2\nrequested consultation from DCWL via Teams. Licensing\nSupervisor reported Youth A was returning to the foster home that\nevening. Licensing Supervisor and Licensing Worker 2 asked how\nFoster Parent could physically intervene with Youth A’s dangerous\nbehaviors in a way that would keep the child safe, and not violate\nlicensing rules. The agency requested clarification on the\ndifference between physical restraint versus acceptable physical\nintervention. Different scenarios were discussed regarding\nbehaviors Youth A had exhibited such as banging her head, trying\n4",
    "to jump out a window, running into traffic, and putting things in her\nmouth. Clarification was provided that holding, hugging, moving a\nchild as a life-saving measure to prevent harm to self or others\nwould be physical intervention. Restricting movement of a child\nthat is not presenting “imminent” harm would be considered\nrestraint. If a child were in a situation where there was immediate\nrisk of harm, the foster parent could physically intervene as a\nsafety measure but must not restrict the child when the risk is\nlowered.\nOn 3/4/24 Foster Parent was contacted via email to schedule\nan interview. Foster Parent responded she was in the midst of a\nmedical emergency for a youth and requested questions to be\nsent via email for her response. Foster Parent responded on\n3/5/24 and reported she accepted placement of Youth A In\nOctober 2023, aware of her suicidal/homicidal ideations and\nthreats. At the time of placement, the case moved from one\nagency to another. Foster Parent was unaware of any prior safety\nor behavior plans.\nFoster Parent reported that Youth B stepped in at times to assist\nhis sister. Foster Parent reflected that she had observed Youth B\nholding Youth A like a baby at their prior placement, which helped\nYouth A calm down. Foster Parent observed that at times Youth B\nis very effective at providing a safe place and calming Youth A.\nDuring the incident that was investigated by the agency, Youth B\nand Foster Parent held Youth A’s arms and legs loosely, allowing\nher to move, but restricting her when she would attempt to bite,\nbang her head on the headboard, kick the wall, or try to scratch\nthem. Foster Parent stated Youth A’s Occupational Therapist said\nthat restricted movement was a good thing for her because it\ncreated a deeper sensory input for her and helped her tire out or\ncalm down faster. Foster Parent stated she became aware that\nYouth B could not assist with holds when the agency informed her\nrecently. Foster Parent has attempted to hold Youth A on her own\nbut has been unable as Youth A is strong when she is determined\nto harm herself. Recently, when Youth A was in the hospital for 6\ndays, it took three staff to hold her and prevent her from harming\nherself.\nSince the special evaluation, agency staff have provided\nclarification regarding physical intervention and restraint.\nLicensing Worker 2 discussed several scenarios with Foster\nParent and potential appropriate physical interventions if needed.\nFoster Care Worker developed a formal safety plan/behavior plan\n5",
    "with Foster Parent, including recommendations from the Child\nPsychiatrist.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Special evaluation report identified incidents of Foster Child\n1 attempting to harm herself. Foster Parent and Foster\nChild 2 held Foster Child 1’s wrists and upper thighs while\nshe laid on the bed. Foster Parent took a video as advised\nby Foster Care Worker. No marks or bruises were\nobserved. Foster Parent was found in compliance with\nlicensing rules. Agency reported the restraint followed the\nlicensing rule 9404 (2) as “reasonable method of physical\nintervention”. The agency did not have a copy of the video.\n• Review of Foster Home Licensing rule R 400.9404\nBehavior management.\no (2) A foster parent may use reasonable restraint\nmethods of physical intervention to prevent a foster\nchild from harming himself or herself, or other\npersons.\no (4) All the following are prohibited: (a) Corporal\npunishment, any type of restraint, or any kind of\npunishment inflicted on the body.\n• Review of Public Act: Page 8- 722.112b Definitions. (h)\n“personal restraint” means the application of physical force\nwithout the use of a device, for the purpose of restraining\nthe free movement of a minor child's body. Personal\nrestraint does not include: (ii) Briefly holding a minor child\nwithout undue force in order to calm or comfort him or her.\n• Youth A’s MiSACWIS case record was reviewed. No\ndocumentation was found to indicate restraint was part of a\nsafety plan or behavior management plan for Youth A prior\nto the special evaluation.\n• Safety plan dated 2/22/24 was signed by Foster Care\nWorker. The plan outlined Youth A’s medication, parenting\ntime change, resources available to foster parent, and the\nconsultation from DCWL regarding appropriate physical\nintervention.\nAnalysis The agency is found in noncompliance as it was determined the\nagency did not cite a violation for an incident where the foster\nparent and another child in the home, physically restrained a\nfoster child by holding them down and restricting their arms and\nlegs.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n6",
    "The agency was provided with guidance regarding the difference\nbetween physical intervention to keep a child safe from injury,\nversus physical restraint. The agency was advised to contact\nDCWL to discuss any situations they were unsure of. The agency\nwas informed that children cannot assist in physical restraint or\nany behavior management of another child. The agency was\nprovided with the Public Act-116 definition of restraint. The agency\nwas also provided information about the clinical review process\navailable for youth with mental health needs and behavioral\nconcerns.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_ _____________March 6, 2024_______________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch, 8 2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
