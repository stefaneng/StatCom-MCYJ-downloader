    "VI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans(CAP) during this\nlicensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan related to the agency's 2023 Interim inspection\nwhich was completed on 1/4/2024, with the CAP approved on 5/8/2024. During\nthat Interim inspection the agency received 37 rule violations. It was the findings\nin the Interim inspection which resulted in the agency’s current provisional\nlicensing status.\nDuring this Renewal inspection the agency received 21 rule violations (a decrease\nfrom the 37 it received during the 2023 Interim inspection) of which 14 are repeat\nviolation (12 are specific repeats from 2023). The agency’s CAP compliance\naround the 12 rule violations is as follows: with the exception of ADM 330 for\nAdoption quarterly progress reports, where the number of individual cases cited\nincreased from 2 of 6 (for its open cases) to 6 of 7; and R400.12420(1)(g) for\nUpdated service plans and FOM-801-3 for Medical passports, where the number\nof individual cases cited stayed the same (2 of 6 and 3 of 8 respectively); and the\nremaining 11 violations showed slight deceases. Rules R400.12405(5)(a) &(b) for\nChange of placement and R400.12212(3)(a) for Personnel records showed the\nhighest decreases, from 6 of 8 to 2 of 6 and from 8 of 26 to 3 of 21 respectively for\nthe number of individual cases cited. Continued staff turnover; and therein the\nneed to train and get staff acclimated to all requirements impacted the agency’s\nrule/policy compliances and contributed to repeat violations.\nElectronic and or physical documents/tools we reviewed for verification of CAP\ncompliance and the above reporting showed that the agency made some\nprogress on its CAP. It was not totally successful with all aspects of the CAP, as\nsome repeat violations occurred. The agency continues to be impacted by staff\nturnover and inexperienced line staff.
