    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• ILP agreement forms should require a dated signature to verify when they are\nbeing updated/completed/signed.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• When face to face in foster home case contact narrative is minimal it is\ndifficult to determine if quality visits are being completed and, in some cases,\nwho was met with/spoken with during the visit.\n• Independent Living licensing rules apply to all youth living independently,\nregardless of contract type (IL, ILP, etc.)\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows. The CAP\nsubmitted by the agency was in response to the 10/31/2023 licensing inspection\nreport and was approved on 11/16/23. That CAP addressed 26 violations, seven\nof which were policy related and 19 of which were licensing rule related. Twelve of\nthose rule related violations were repeated during this inspection (9 of which were\nsubsections of one rule.) Eight of the seventeen repeats have been repeated\nduring the past two inspections. Four of the violations established this year were\nnot established in the past two years. The violations which have been consistently\nrepeated all relate to independent living files; therefore, additional assessment and\ncorrective action planning will be needed to address those violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator reported barriers and systemic factors impacting\ncompliance were low staffing/applicants, supervisor turnover, and lack of\nplacement resources for high needs youth resulting in staff spending a lot of time\nwith youths in person as well as attempting to locate placement. Areas in which\ncompliance was impacted were timeliness of reports and paperwork completion.",
    "Financial Overview\nThe chief administrator provided the agency budget as well as an independent\nauditor's statement related to the consolidated financial statements. No financial\nconcerns were identified.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed all reported positive experiences working at the agency. One\nstaff did state her caseload felt overwhelming at times; however, she stated she\nhas always remained within the required caseload size. All of the staff reported\nconsistent and supportive supervision.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have sufficient space and equipment to provide for the\ndelivery of foster care, adoption, independent living, and foster home certification\nservices. Closed adoption files and physical CHRI are stored securely in separate\nlocked locations preventing unauthorized access. A cross shredder was observed\non-site.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nNovember 13, 2024\n_____________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 14, 2024\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
