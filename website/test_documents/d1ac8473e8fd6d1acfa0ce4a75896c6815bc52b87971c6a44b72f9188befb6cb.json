    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except\nfor the following:\nR 400.12306 Application request.\n(4) An agency shall document that the licensee has been\ngiven an application for renewal of the license not less than\n60 calendar days before the expiration date of the license.\nOne of the eight current foster home files reviewed indicated the foster parents were\nnot given an application for renewal of their foster home license at least 60 calendar\ndays before the expiration date of the license. In this instance the expiration date of\nthe license was 7/06/2021 and the application was sent 6/03/21.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(4) An agency shall document placement specifications\nconsistent with the information contained in the\nreevaluation. The placement specifications shall include all\nof the following:\n(a) Age,\n(b) Gender,\n(c) Race,\n(d) Number of children preferred by the family,\n(e) Characteristics of children best served by the home,\n(f) Children who may not be placed in the home. The\nchild's racial, ethnic, and cultural identity, heritage, and\nbackground may only be considered if an assessment of\nthe individual child indicates that such consideration is in\nthe best interests of the child.\nFour of the eight current foster home files reviewed contained annual evaluations of\nthe foster home that did not maintain compliance with this rule. The first instance\nmade a statement there should be no change, without presenting what the current\ncharacteristics were approved. Four of the eight files had an age range that was\ninconsistent with the applicable license (3706). This is a repeat noncompliance\nfrom the renewal evaluation completed 05/08/2020.\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home.\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by another\nagency or tribe, the agency shall have a record containing all of\nthe following documents:\n(e) A list of all children currently placed in the home.\n3",
    "One of the three borrowed home files reviewed did not include a placement list of\nchildren placed in the home. At the time of the exit conference, it was reported the\nhome had not had any previous placements until the borrowed bed placement was\nmade.\nR 400.12326 Borrowed home.\n(1) Before placing a child in a foster home certified by another\nagency or tribe, the agency shall have a record containing all of\nthe following documents:\n(h) A copy of the current children's foster home license\napplication and children's foster home licensing transaction\nrecord documents from the certifying agency.\nTwo of the three borrowed home files reviewed either did not include a copy of the\ncurrent license (3706) or did not include a copy of the current application for the\nhome.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in the\nagency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(a) Submit a special investigation record to the department's\nlicensing authority within 5 working days in the manner\nprescribed by the department.\nOne of the three special evaluation records reviewed indicated the special\ninvestigation record (259) was not submitted to the department’s licensing authority\nwithin the 5 working days as required by this rule. In this example the intake date\nwas identified as 12/28/2020 and the 259 was submitted 01/13/2021.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(6) An agency shall do all of the following:\n(b) Inform the foster parent, in writing, that he or she has a\nright to have his or her written response included as an\nattachment to the report required by subrule (5) of this rule.\nThree of the three special evaluation records reviewed did not include\ndocumentation the foster parents were informed in writing they could have a written\nresponse included as an attachment to the completed report. The agency previously\nincluded this language in a standard letter that was sent to the foster parents with\nthe report, but this language was missing from the special evaluations reviewed.\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(4) If an emergency change in placement is necessary, then all\nof the documentation required in subrules (2) and (3) of this rule\n4",
    "shall be in the child's record within 14 calendar days after the\nchange in placement.\nOne of the eight current foster child records reviewed indicated the foster child had\nat least one change in placement and the documentation for the change in\nplacement could not be located. In this example it appeared this youth had 8\nchanges in placement where sufficient documentation of the changes could not be\nfound.\nR 400.12413 Medical and dental care policy.\n(2) An agency shall have documentation from the medical or\ndental provider of all medical and dental care received by a\nfoster child.\nThree of the eight current foster child records reviewed did not include medical\npassports with the documentation of all medical or dental care received by the foster\nchild and/or medical passports that included signatures by the caregivers of the\nfoster child.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the\nfollowing:\nISEP 4.22\nExamples of some missing documentation from foster home files in the MISACWIS\ninformation system included copies of current foster home licenses (3706 ) in four of the\neight foster home files reviewed. Examples of some missing information in three of the\neight foster child records were Parent Agency Treatment Plans and/or Parent Agency\nTreatment Plans with signatures. This is a repeat noncompliance with the renewal\nevaluation completed 05/08/2020.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\nNone required.\nIV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\nNone required. There were no alerts as reported in the findings of the analyst.\n5",
    "EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nAND\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan for the renewal evaluation\ncompleted 05/08/2020. Areas identified in noncompliance as a part of the renewal\nevaluation were R 400.12324 (4), R 400.12327 (5)(d), R 400.12418 (2)(b), ISEP 4.22,\nDHHS Policy 722-06B, and FTM completions. The only areas identified as repeat\nnoncompliance as a part of this interim evaluation were R 400.12324 (4), and ISEP\n4.22.\nV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n08/04/2021\n________________________________________\nMark R.
