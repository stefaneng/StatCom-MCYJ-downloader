TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n The agency was reminded to ensure the 3080, 3706 and 4005\nrecommendations match when a license renewal is submitted.\n PATP signatures- the agency was informed that non-respondent parents\nmust sign PATPs as the “caregiver”. In addition, it was clarified that PATP\n6",
    "signatures are required within 30 days of the report date, not the report\napproval date.\n The agency reported difficulty scheduling medical/dental exams due to\nCOVID. Staff were encouraged to remind the foster parents that follow-up\nappointments should be scheduled before leaving a medical/dental\nappointment, to ensure timely scheduling.\n The agency reported a youth that attended a dental appointment but was\nunable to finish the appointment due to behavioral issues. A plan was\ndeveloped for sedation dentistry at the next appointment. The agency was\nadvised to ensure thorough documentation is uploaded to support this\nincident which resulted in a late dental exam.\n The agency reported difficulty obtaining immunization records for a youth that\npreviously lived out of state. The agency attempted to contact the health\ndepartment of the other state, as well as the youth’s former school. The\nagency was advised to document all attempts to obtain the document.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nA special evaluation was initiated on 4/21/21 due to an allegation that a child was\nsexually assaulted by a known sex offender, residing in the home of the licensee’s\nsubstitute caregiver. The investigation determined a violation of Rule 201(j) Foster\nParent Qualifications, as the foster parents were aware a sex offender resided in the\nhome. The DHHS investigation also determine the foster parents failed to provide\nthe child with proper supervision and protection. The agency recommended\nrevocation of the license on 7/9/2021. In follow-up on 2/17/22 with the DCWL\nDisciplinary Action Unit, it was reported the revocation packet was pending approval\nby the Director. A review of documents associated with this report found that the\nagency completed a thorough investigation and made a recommendation consistent\nwith their findings.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nA special evaluation was initiated on 9/9/21 due to allegations the foster parent used\nsoap in a child’s mouth as punishment and used a belt to spank biological/adopted\nchildren in the home. The Special evaluation concluded on 10/1/21 with findings of\nviolation for Rule 404(3) behavior management. A safety plan was developed which\nincluded an agreement to refrain from spanking biological/adopted children in the\nhome while under a borrowed bed agreement with a private agency. The foster\nparents also agreed to discontinue use of threatening language or intimidation, and\ndiscontinue threats of soap or other objects as discipline. The agreement indicated\nthe licensee would use positive reinforcement, participate in youth’s trauma therapy,\nfollow therapy recommendations, and notify the agency of any incidents. A CAP was\n7",
    "signed on 11/15/21 in which the family agreed to the safety plan, reviewed policy,\ncompleted training regarding alternate discipline methods, and provided the agency\nwith a written summary of what was learned during training. The CAP was\ncompleted on 12/15/21. There are no additional concerns about the home at this\ntime. The investigation and accompanying documents were reviewed and found to\nfollow licensing rules.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP, approved 5/4/21, was a result of the 3/15/21 interim review. During the\n2021 review, nineteen violations were found. During this 2022 review, the agency\ndecreased the areas of non-compliance and had nine violations, five of which were\nrepeats. Although there were repeat violations, each occurrence had decreased\nfrom the prior review. The agency reported several areas of successful CAP\nimplementation, which is evident by the significant improvement in many areas that\nwere previously cited.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed with the agency.\nThe agency reported that staff have adjusted to a hybrid schedule of in-person and\nremote working. The agency reported having some brief staff shortages during the\npast year. However, they are now fully staffed and foster care workers have\ncompleted required training. The agency indicated the prior CAP has been\nimplemented and appears to be going well in many areas. However, there are still\nsome challenges in regard to timely signatures. Supervisors have developed a\ntracking system, which has been helpful in making staff aware of upcoming due\ndates. This system has helped staff with planning at a glance when they have\nseveral timeframes to monitor. In addition, staff have focused on compliance with\nindependent living and placement/replacement documents, as these were areas that\nwere cited in the past two years. The agency reported using new tools that have\nhelped in these areas.\nInterviews\nOne foster care and one licensing staff were interviewed. Both staff reported being\nwith the agency for several years. Both staff stated the environment is positive,\nhelpful, and they get along well with co-workers. The two staff have different\nsupervisors, but both reported their supervisors were supportive and helpful. Neither\nstaff had any concerns or suggestions for improvements at the agency.\nVII. ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or policy. Upon receipt of an\n8",
    "acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n________________March 4, 2022________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 4, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n9"
