    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(3) If the responsibility for the child’s case moves from one agency to another, there\nmust be some kind of new plan in the child’s file within 30 calendar days after the\nchange. It does not have to be a complete Service Plan, but must address why the\ncase was transferred, whether the new worker/agency agrees with the previous case\nplans, and any changes since the last plan was written. History from previous plans\nmay be referenced in this plan.\n(4) The agency must document that the service plan was reviewed and provided to\nthe foster parents. Documentation may be in social work contacts or by the foster\nparent signing a document acknowledging that the plan was reviewed and a copy\nreceived.\nOne of sixteen service plans was late. The assigned case manager was out on an\nunexpected leave. The agency has been effective in completing service plans timely.\nThis rule has not been cited during the previous three (2018, 2017, 2016) reviews. A\ncorrective action plan is required.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an ISEP violation. Please note that there are\nadditional ISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1. The facility is in\ncompliance will all additional ISEP requirements except for the following:\nISEP 5.1 – Page 14 Caseload Progressions for New Employees (Commitment\n23).\nb. For foster care and adoption workers, three training cases may be assigned on or\nafter day one of pre-service training at the supervisor’s discretion using CWTI case\nassignments guidelines. After completion of week three of pre-service training, up to\nfive total cases may be assigned with supervisory approval using CWTI case\nassignment guidelines. Final caseload may be assigned after nine weeks.\nOne of three case managers hired since the last review was assigned cases on the\npre-service registration date not on or after the first date of training. The supervisor\nwas not clear on the language of this requirement. A corrective action plan is required.\nISEP 6.16.3 - Page 23 Relative Foster Parents (Commitment 52).\n(a) When placing a child with a relative who has not been previously licensed as a\n4",
    "foster parent DHHS shall:\n(3) within 30 days, complete a home study determining whether the relative should,\nupon completion of training and submission of any other required documents, be\nlicensed as a foster parent.\nThe 3130a for one unlicensed relative care giver was completed after 60 days. A\ncorrective action plan is required.\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note that there\nare additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be included in section\n1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements\nexcept for the following:\nDHHS Policy FOM 722-6H – Page 7 Unannounced Home Visit CASEWORKER\nCONTACT WITH CAREGIVERS\nThe caseworker must have at least one face-to-face contact in the caregiver’s home\neach calendar month. If there are two caregivers, such as a primary and secondary\ncaregiver, the caseworker must have a face-to-face contact with the secondary\ncaregiver in the home at least once each quarter. The caseworker must make an\nunannounced visit to the home every quarter. The unannounced visit must be\ndocumented in MiSACWIS.\nSixteen service plans were reviewed. Three unannounced home visits were not\ncompleted as required. The required monthly home visits were conducted as\nscheduled visits. This is a repeat violation from the 2018 interim inspection.\n.\nDHHS Policy FOM 722-08C Page 2 Required Participation in Development -\nFoster Parent / Caregiver\nThe individual activities required by the foster parent/caregiver to meet the specific\nindividual needs of the child placed in their home are included in the PATP. The foster\nparent/caregiver must be included in the PATP process. The foster parent/caregiver\nsignature is required and indicates that the foster parent/caregiver acknowledges\nand agrees to the activities required to meet the needs of the child in their care.\nAdditionally, the PATP details the services and activities provided by the foster care\nworker to assist the foster parent/caregiver in caring for the child.\nSixteen service plans were reviewed. The required PATPs were not signed by both\ncare givers for three service plans. It should be noted that social work contacts by the\nassigned case manager documented the engagement of the caregivers in the\ndevelopment of the service plan. This is a repeat violation from the 2018 interim\ninspection. A corrective action plan is required.\n5",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was not offered technical assistance.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was not offered consultation.\n6",
    "DCWL Analyst report\nThe DCWL analyst between the dates of 10/30/18 – 11/15/18 visited three foster\nhomes and two unlicensed relative homes completing nine interviews. The findings\nof these interviews are documented below.\nSafety and concern alert # 1\nThe home smells very strongly of cigarette smoke. The foster parent states she\nsmokes outside.\nThe agency responded there are no children placed in this home is closed.\nSafety and concern alert # 2\nA child under the age of 5 is placed in the home. The home needs plug covers in the\nelectrical outlets.\nOne bedroom used by household members has twin bed headboards blocking the\nwindows in the bedroom. The windows are the second means of egress for the\nbedroom.\nThe agency responded that the family has rearranged the bedroom. They have set\nbunk beds up and have put a crib in the room. The window is not blocked. Outlet\nplugs have been put back on. Pictures document these changes.\nSafety and concern alert # 3\nA room used as a bedroom does not have a second means of egress. The room is\ncurrently occupied by a child that is adopted and has special emotional needs. The\nfoster parent states there is an approved safety plan for the use of this bedroom.\nThe agency responded that the adopted son has moved into another bedroom, with a\nsecond means of egress. A picture documents this change.\nSafety and concern alert # 4\nA birth mother reported she was not given the opportunity to give input into the\ntreatment plan. She was directed as to what she had to do.\nThe relative caregiver needs medical insurance cards for both children in the home.\nThe agency responded that the mother spoke with the analyst on 8/15/18 regarding\nservices and was able to give her input. The contact is in the service plan. She signed\nthe initial court report giving the services. She went over with her attorney what the\nservices were and they both agreed upon them and was read into the record on\n9/11/18. On 11/13/18 during a home visit to the mother by the interim case manager\nthe services were reviewed and included the mother’s input.\n7",
    "The assigned case manager was never made aware the caregiver never received\nmedical cards. Cards were ordered once it was known caregiver was missing\ninsurance cards at the 10/25/18 home visit. Contact was made with the HLO right\naway on 10/25/18, and the cards were ordered. They were given to the caregiver on\n11/27/18 as the worker was off on medical leave and the cards arrived 11/15/18.\nThe agency also reported to this consultant that the DHS 3762 (temporary medical\nauthorization card)- Consent to Routine, Non-surgical, medical care and emergency\nmedical/treatment card was provided by CPS on the date of removal, 7/3/2018 to the\ncaregiver for both children.\nSafety and concern alert # 5\nThe bedroom used by the child placed in the home is a tandem bedroom and is used\nas a passthrough by another household member to get to and from their bedroom.\nThe relative caretakers were unaware of possible financial assistance available to\nthem to care for the child placed in the home. For example, the ineligible grant.\nThe relative caretaker does not have a medical passport for the child placed in the\nhome.\nThe agency responded that the bedroom where the child resides with another\nbedroom where the 17-year-old cousin resides. Agency certification staff that the\narrangement is not a rule violation. The two youth are cousins and close in age. The\narrangement would be the same as 2 teenage girls sharing a room which is permitted\nby licensing rule. This arrangement gives each girl more privacy.\nUpon initial placement of the child in the home, ineligible grantee was discussed as\nwell as them getting them licensed. Initially the relatives were going to get licensed\nand were not concerned with ineligible grantee monies. The relative caretakers have\nbeen extremely indecisive in the whole licensing process. The licensing worker has\nhad several contacts with the relatives where they indicated they wanted to get\nlicensed and then cancelled the appointment or stated they call back and never did.\nThe agency currently has a signed waiver they signed in November.\nThe agency reported a medical passport was not given to them. It is believed the\nrelatives meant to say they do not have medical cards. They do not have medical\ncards due to choosing United Health Care once the child returned to the community.\nThe insurance card was not accepted by the child’s therapist. The child did not want\nto change therapists. HLO staff has facilitated the selection of another health plan that\nwould cover therapy. Coverage began on 12/1/18. A signed medical passport\ndocumented the passport was provided at the child’s placement.\n8",

As the goals are achieved, modified or expanded, the updated PATP will\nreflect this process. Parents and youths age 14 and older must participate in the\ndevelopment of each updated treatment plan, allowing for opportunity to evaluate\ntheir progress towards completing goals.\n10",
