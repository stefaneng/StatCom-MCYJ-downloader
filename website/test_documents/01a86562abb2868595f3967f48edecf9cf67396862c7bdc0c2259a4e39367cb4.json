    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4431 Heating equipment.\nSection\nDescription (1) Heating equipment shall be capable of maintaining a\ntemperature of not less than 68 degrees Fahrenheit at a point 4\nfeet above the floor. An accurate thermometer shall be provided.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The building has cluttered vents, no heat, and cold temperatures.\nInvestigation DCWL received these allegations on 1/22/24 via DCWL online\ncomplaint. The Complainant was listed as Anonymous.\nI arrived onsite on 1/25/24 unannounced accompanied by\nGovernment Worker 1. I reviewed the allegations with Chief\nAdministrator (CA) and Vice President of Residential Services.\nLicensee Designee was also present in the building.\nOnsite Inspection:\nI observed heat vents in the staff bathroom and hallways and saw\nno clutter or obstructions. Government Worker 1 and I toured the\nfacility from basement to the third floor living spaces with Director\nof Operations and Facilities. Each floor was warm with portable\nthermostats showing temperatures between 72 - 76 degrees.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nThe Renewal Report by Former Agency Consultant indicates the\nmost recent Environmental/Health Inspection completed on\n07/28/2023 received an A rating.\nPrinted internal emails and invoices from Allied Building Service\nCompany of Detroit showed the facility contracts with this\ncompany to regulate the heat and make various other facility\nrepairs. Photos taken on 11/30/23 of thermometers showed the\nfollowing temperatures: Basement 79.5; First Floor 79.2; Second\nFloor 72.3; Third Floor 68.5. Invoice dated 12/1/23 indicated\nrepairs to furnaces and baseboard heaters were made totaling\n$938. Invoice dated 1/18/24 showed a follow up service call\noccurred noting boilers/pumps and registers were heating\nproperly.\n3",
    "Interview:\nAgency Consultant stated she was at the facility on 1/18/24,\ntoured the building and felt heat on the first, second and third\nfloors.\nYouth E said the heat was blasting and he asked staff to put on\nthe air conditioning, but they refused.\nAnalysis DCWL Consultants felt heat on each floor on 1/18/24 and 1/25/24.\nDocuments indicate the building has had some issues with heat\nregulation and contracts with a company that makes ongoing\nrepairs as needed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4407 Facility and premises maintenance.\nSection (1) A facility and premises shall be maintained in a clean,\nDescription comfortable, and safe condition. The facility shall be located on\nland that is properly drained.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The facility does not sanitize for the safety of others.\nThere are no cleaning products provided. Dirty mops reused to\nclean.\nInvestigation Onsite inspection:\nWhen I arrived onsite on 1/25/24, it was noted the conference\nroom table was freshly sanitized. As I toured the building, I\nobserved cleaning products, mops and mop buckets in the first-\nfloor staff bathroom and mop closets on each floor. The\nbasement storage room had cases of various cleaning products,\ndry and wet mop heads, and floor scrubbers.\nWhen I arrived onsite again on 2/7/24, a staff person sanitized the\nconference room table in my presence.\nInterview\nDirector of Operations and Facilities informed me that floor staff\nand/or youths clean and mop the living areas. When a mop head\nis dirty, it should be sent to the laundry in the basement to be\nwashed and replaced with a fresh mop head from supply room.\nAnalysis Staff and/or youths are responsible for cleaning and sanitizing the\nliving areas. The facility was observed with ample cleaning\n4",
    "products. When mops are dirty, they should be sent to the\nlaundry and replaced with a fresh mop head from the supply room.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation ALLEGATION 1\nOn 1/15/24, an unidentified staff choked an unidentified youth.\nAnother unidentified staff begged him to release the youth. The\nyouth was discharged the next day, and the staff went on medical\nleave.\nALLEGATION 2\nOn 1/1/24, an unidentified staff threw an unidentified youth to the\nground and choked him.\nInvestigation ALLEGATION 1\nDocuments reviewed:\nIt should be noted that the only written report for this incident was\nauthored by Supervisor 1 who was not present when it started.\nThe incident report dated 1/15/24 at 9:30pm indicated Supervisor\n1 was notified of a physical altercation between Staff 1, Youth B\nand Youth E. Supervisor 1 arrived at the second floor (lounge)\nand observed Staff 1 and Youth B on the floor with a very tight\nhold on each other. Supervisor 1, Staff 2, Staff 3 and Staff 4 used\npulling motions and techniques to separate them. While doing so,\nYouth E punched and kicked Staff 1 on the ground. Staff tried\ntheir best to remove Youth E. Once Staff 1 was released, other\nstaff held Youth B and Youth E until Staff 1 was out of the\nbuilding. Program Director was notified…Law enforcement\ncontacted. Ambulance came.\nA Behavior Notification by Supervisor 1 at 9:50pm explained why\nthe ambulance came. It indicated Youth B laid on the bathroom\nfloor holding his chest signaling he couldn’t breathe. Asked if he\n5",
    "was okay, Youth B said “Bitch, fuck you” and held his chest again.\nAfter seeing his chest rise and fall very fast, ambulance was\ncontacted. This occurred (20 minutes) after Youth B had physical\naltercation with Staff 1.\nHospital discharge instructions from Beaumont Emergency\nDepartment dated 1/16/24 indicated Youth B was diagnosed with\nNeck Sprain, also known as a pulled muscle. No treatment was\nprovided.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) jointly with Government\nWorker 1 on 1/25/24. She said Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 3 or Staff 4\ndid not write incident reports, but she would obtain written\nstatements. By 2/7/24, no written statements or additional\nincident reports were provided.\nCA stated Youth B was being supervised on 1:1 by Staff 1 when\nthis event took place. She refuted the allegation and clarified that\nStaff 1 did not attack Youth B, but rather Youths B and E attacked\nhim. She said Detroit Police were shown video of the incident\nand identified Youth B as the aggressor. The police contacted the\nWayne County Juvenile Detention Center requesting approval to\ntransport Youth B and Youth E there. Permission was denied,\nand both youths remained at Wolverine Center. Staff 1 was\ninjured and still on medical leave as a result of the incident.\nSupervisor 1 was “written up” for writing a misleading incident\nreport. Youth B was discharged the day after the incident\n(1/16/24) to Muskegon MDHHS. Youth E was discharged to\nanother facility the last week in January 2024.\nCourtesy Worker interviewed Youth B at Muskegon County\nJuvenile Transition Center on 2/8/24. No visible marks or bruises\nwere observed. Youth B recalled being at Wolverine Center and\ntold her things were fine there. With additional prompting, Youth B\nstated there was a fight where a staff took him by the neck and\nchoked him. While the staff choked him, Youth B said he threw up\nand the staff let him go. Youth B refused to name the staff stating\nhe wanted his name left out of reports and court documents. After\nbeing choked, he said he received medical attention. He denied\nany other incidents occurred at Wolverine Center.\nOn 2/7/24 I interviewed Youth E jointly with Government Worker 1\nvia Teams. Youth E presented with a silly non-serious demeanor,\nlaughing and untruthful about the facts relative to the incidents he\nwas involved in at Wolverine Center.\n6",
    "Youth E was vague regarding this specific incident. He stated\nYouth B wanted to call a supervisor. “A fight was gonna start and\nain’t nobody want no charges so I covered the camera. Youth B\npushed Staff 1 three times. Staff 1 put Youth B in a choke hold.\nStaff 1 got hit a couple times by another youth.” Youth E claimed\nhe did not know who hit Staff 1, but video showed it was actually\nhim (Youth E) hitting Staff 1.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1 on 2/7/24.\nHe has worked at the facility for four years and returned from\nmedical leave on 1/26/24. Regarding the incident, Staff 1 said it\nwas bedtime and he was in the lounge with Youth B when\nManager asked the youth to turn the game off. Youth B asked\nStaff 1 to text a different supervisor and get permission to continue\nthe game. Then Youth B asked to see Staff 1’s phone to check if\nhe texted the supervisor. When Staff 1 refused to show Youth B\nhis phone, Youth B called out for Youth E. Youth E arrived at the\nlounge and the boys sat close whispering. Youth B asked why\nStaff 1 was still in the room and told Youth E to cover up the\ncamera. Youth E covered the camera. Staff 1 said he responded\nby standing in a protective stance and attempted verbally de-\nescalating the youth. “Youth B ignored me and kicked a big chair\ntoward me. He punched me in the chest. I grabbed him and we\nfell on the floor together. Youth B was trying to get on top of me.\nYouth E tried to drag me. I got in a rear-naked position.”\nAsked to explain a “rear-naked position” Staff 1 said it is a\nwrestling move. He explained he was alone with Youths B and\nYouth E and they overpowered him. Staff 1 felt “unsafe” and\nresorted to “fight or flight” mode. “I had no help until four- or five-\nminutes in. (On the floor) I had my legs wrapped around Youth B\nand blocked his arms from grabbing me as well. I was just waiting\nfor help repeatedly getting hit in my head by Youth E. I ended up\nwith bruised ribs and a cervical spine contusion.” Once several\nstaff arrived at the room, “the staff got Youth B off of me. I got up\nimmediately and left the building. There were all female staff and\none elderly male staff here in the building.”\nI interviewed Staff 3 jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nworked at the facility for one month and worked in the Wayne\nCounty Jail prior to that. Staff 3 said she went to the second-floor\nlounge after hearing commotion. “It was dark, and Youth B and\nStaff 1 were on the floor. Youth E was stomping Staff 1’s side.\nWe tried to pry them apart and push Youth E away. We tried to\nintervene taking Youth E’s hands, but Youth E and Youth B are\n7",
    "big guys. Once we pushed Youth E back, Staff 1 was able to get\nout…Staff 1 was coherent. He didn’t do anything wrong. I don’t\nremember Staff 1 choking Youth B. His arms were around Youth\nB’s arms to keep Youth B from punching and hitting him.”\nShortly after the incident, Staff 3 said Youth B went in the\nbathroom, pulled a pipe and sink bowl off of the wall, then stated\nhe was having an anxiety attack with difficulty breathing. An\nambulance was called, and the youth was transported to\nBeaumont Emergency Department.\nVideo of second floor lounge on 1/15/23\nThe camera view begins cloudy. Youth B and Staff 1 are sitting\nacross the room from each other. Youth E walks into the room,\nsays something to Staff 1 and walks out. Youth E returns and sits\nin a chair facing Youth B with his back to Staff 1. Both youths\nstand up together and Youth B sets a chair in position for Youth E\nto stand on. Youth E covers the camera lens with his hand for 9\nseconds. When he uncovers the camera, Youth B and Staff 1 are\nnot seen. They appear to be on the floor behind a table for the\nnext 20 seconds. Youth E watches them struggle on the floor\nthen leaves the room presumably to see if someone is coming.\nYouth E reenters the room and starts pulling at someone on the\nfloor. 26 seconds later, six staff enter the room one by one.\nYouth E is standing over Staff 1 punching him while Staff 1 is on\nthe floor struggling to free himself from Youth B. A male staff is\nfinally able to pull Youth E off of Staff 1. Youth B and Staff 1\nremain on the floor but cannot be seen because six staff and\nYouth E are standing around them. Youth E keeps trying to get at\nStaff 1 while several staff attempt to block him. One female staff\nphysically tries to help Staff 1 while Youth E darts and jumps\naround the area. Staff 1 and Youth B come into view. Staff 1 is\non his back on the floor and Youth B is on his back lying on top of\nStaff 1. Staff 1 has his legs wrapped around Youth B’s\nmidsection. From beneath him, Staff 1 briefly has his arm\nwrapped around the front of Youth B’s neck. Two female staff pull\nYouth B up by his arms to a standing position. Youth B turns back\nto get at Staff 1 again who is sat up on the floor. Youth E and\nYouth B continue to approach Staff 1 aggressively while various\nstaff hold him back. Staff 1 is finally able to stand and move\nhimself out of the room while Youths B and Youth E are pushing\nthrough staff to follow him. Youth B removes his t-shirt. Staff\nblock the doorway to prevent him from exiting. Youth B paces\naggressively shirtless around the room for 30 seconds then\nbreaks through a female staff and exits the room. 25 seconds\nlater Youth B reenters the room alone.\n8",
    "Government Worker 1 had findings.\nALLEGATION 2\nOn 1/1/24, an unidentified staff threw an unidentified youth to the\nground and choked him.\nINVESTIGATION\nDocuments reviewed:\nAn incident report was requested onsite on 1/25/24 and not\navailable. I requested it again via email on 2/2/24. On 2/7/24 CA\ntold us there was only one incident report written by Supervisor 1\nwho did not witness the event. Supervisor 2’s incident report was\nmissing, and Staff 5 did not complete one.\nInterviews:\nOn 1/25/24 CA identified Supervisor 2 and Youth B as involved in\nthe incident. She refuted the allegation and clarified that Youth B\nattacked Supervisor 2 and not the reverse. She said Youth B was\ntransferred to Muskegon County Juvenile Transition Center on\n1/16/24 and Supervisor 2 was still on medical leave as a result of\nthis incident.\nVideo for this incident was requested. On 2/7/24, CA told us there\nwas no video because it happened in the first-floor stairwell under\nthe camera. Government Worker 1 asked CA to recheck video of\nthe second-floor stairwell. On 2/11/24 CA emailed explaining the\nentire incident lasted over an hour, there was no useful video on\nthe 2nd floor stairwell due to the lights being off, the camera angle\nin relation to where Supervisor 2 was attacked, and the duration of\nthe assault.\nAccording to CA, video footage did not capture this incident.\nHowever, she provided a still photo taken by Supervisor 1\nshowing Youth B with Supervisor 2 in a headlock with Staff 5 in\nthe background.\nSupervisor 1 resigned on 2/17/24 and could not be interviewed.\nCourtesy Worker interviewed Youth B. He denied any incidents\ntook place at Wolverine Center other than what was discussed in\nallegation 1.\n9",
    "I interviewed Youth E jointly with Government Worker 1 via Teams\non 2/7/24. Youth E presented with a silly demeanor, laughing and\nuntruthful about the facts relative to the incidents in which he was\ninvolved. He claimed he did not witness this incident and\nmentioned nothing about kicking the unit door open, seeing Youth\nB with Supervisor 2 in a headlock, teaming up with Youth B to pull\nat Supervisor 2 or being questioned by the police that night.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1 on\n2/7/24. He said the incident happened on his second day on the\njob. He suffered a herniated disc as a result and has been on\nmedical leave since then. Supervisor 2 said the incident lasted for\nover an hour and insisted he wrote an incident report. He was\nsurprised to hear the report could not be located.\nRegarding the incident on 1/1/24 at 7pm, Supervisor 2 said he\nsaw Youth B and Youth J running around outdoors. “I opened a\ndoor, and they rushed in past me to the stairwell.” Apparently, the\npolice had already been called and supervisors did not want the\nyouths back on the units until they were sufficiently checked in.\nSupervisor 2 continued. “I was in the stairwell with Youths B and\nYouth J. The first-floor unit door opened, and Youth B grabbed\nmy shirt. I grabbed his left arm. Another male staff tried to help\nget Youth B off of me. Youth B was verbally threatening me. He\nlet go of me and I left. The male staff with him had a relationship\nwith Youth B and they stayed talking. Thirty minutes later I heard\nYouth E was awake. I went upstairs because I believed Youth E\nwould let Youth B and Youth J inside of the unit. I was in the\nstairwell and Youth E opened the unit door aggressively kicking it.\nYouth B put his arm around my neck in a headlock. Youth E\ngrabbed my arm, and they pulled me back and forth. I tried to use\nthe CPI push-pull technique to get them off. They rushed me\nagain and we all fell. Youth B took my ID trying to antagonize me.\nThe police arrived and assisted (me). They took Youth B and\nYouth E downstairs and questioned them. I went to Ascension\n(Health Clinic) and was diagnosed with a herniated and bulging\ndisc.”\nSupervisor 2 denied choking Youth B, stating “I never touched his\nchest, neck, or anything. He said he saw no marks or bruises on\nYouth B afterward.\nI interviewed Staff 5 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for five months. On 1/1/24, Staff 5 recalled\nYouth B and Youth E had locked a male staff in the gym. Later,\nhe said he was called to assist Supervisor 2 in the stairwell. “I\n10",
    "looked through the first floor into the landing to the stairwell.\nYouth B and Supervisor 2 were in each other’s arms…I slid my\narm between both of them and whispered softly in Youth B’s ear.\nYouth B went down to the ground and said he was ‘good’. I got\nSupervisor 2 free. I was the only other male staff (in the building).\nI kept Youth B and Youth J in the hallway waiting for police. Then\nI went to assist someone else.” I asked Staff 5 to describe Youth\nB’s state of mind. He described someone who is responding to\ninternal stimuli. Staff 5 stated “I don’t think Youth B exists in\nreality. I feel he’s losing touch with reality. He has layers of\nthoughts that make no sense.”\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis ALLEGATION 1\nBefore six staff arrived to assist him, Staff 1 admitted he used a\nmartial arts chokehold applied from behind Youth B. Choking a\nyouth is considered physical punishment and prohibited by the\nrule.\n(Violation Established)\nALLEGATION 2\nThere was no evidence Supervisor 2 threw a youth to the ground\nand choked him. Conversely a photo taken during part of the\nincident showed Youth B had Supervisor 2 in a headlock.\n(Violation Not Established)\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iv)Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a youth’s\nbackground or appearance or mental state. Yelling, threats,\nridicule, or humiliation are strictly prohibited.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n11",
    "Allegation An unidentified staff told an unidentified youth who went absent\nwithout leave (AWOL) that he would be dead. Manager was\naware and did not address the staff.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nCA said she was unaware of any incident involving an unidentified\nstaff telling an unidentified youth who had gone AWOL that he\nwould be dead. She identified Youth E as a youth who went\nAWOL in January 2024.\nI interviewed Youth E jointly with Government Worker 1. He did\nnot mention that any staff told him he would be dead before,\nbecause or upon returning from AWOL.\nCourtesy Worker interviewed Youth B at the Muskegon County\nJuvenile Transition Center. He denied ever going AWOL from\nWolverine Center.\nDocument Reviewed\nThe incident report documenting Youth E’s AWOL did not indicate\nthat a staff person told him he would be dead.\nAnalysis There is no evidence staff verbally abused or used derogatory\nlanguage pertaining to Youth E’s AWOL.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Around 1/12/24 an unidentified youth was vomiting and did not\nreceive timely medical attention. He was later taken to the\nhospital and diagnosed with RSV or pneumonia.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nCA identified the youth who was taken to the hospital as Youth S.\nGovernment Worker 1 and I attempted to interview Youth S on\n1/25/24. He came to the doorway of the interview room and\nrefused to talk with investigators.\n12",
    "Documents reviewed:\nA Behavior Notification dated 1/12/24 indicated “Youth S woke up\nat 11:00pm feeling bad. His throat and head were hurting. Also\nstomach pains.” Youth S was sent to the hospital and has a virus\ncalled RSV.\nHospital discharge paperwork dated 1/12/24 indicates Youth S\nwas examined at Beaumont Grosse Point Emergency\nDepartment, diagnosed with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection\n(RSV), and prescribed Ibuprofen.\nA Behavior Notification dated 1/14/24 at 3:41am indicated Youth S\nhas a cold. He continued to spit and possibly threw up phlegm.\nYouth S refused a pan to spit in and pain medication. He went\nback to sleep and refused to get up to clean or allow staff to. He\nthrew up on the floor.\nA Behavior Notification dated 1/14/24 at 8:40am indicated Youth S\nwoke up throwing up and complaining of a sore throat. He\ncontinued throwing up non-stop. Youth S was diagnosed with\nRSV on 1/12/24. Youth S was taken to Beaumont (again) today at\n8:45am, admitted at 3:30pm and transferred to Beaumont Hospital\nin Royal Oak.\nHospital Discharge paperwork dated 1/15/24 indicates Youth S\nwas seen at Beaumont University Hospital on 1/14/24 – 1/15/24.\nHe was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia of left\nlower lobe of lung and prescribed an antibiotic and Tylenol.\nAnalysis Youth S was seen at the emergency room on 1/12/24. On 1/14/24\nhe was seen again and admitted. Youth S was discharged from\nBeaumont Hospital on 1/15/24. There is no evidence he did not\nreceive timely medical attention.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\nSection (1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-to-child\nDescription ratio formula for direct care workers. If a child caring institution is\ncontracted by the department to care for youth, the facility will\nfollow its contracted ratio.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n13",
    "Allegation On unidentified date(s), the staff to resident ratio was not met.\nInvestigation Document reviewed:\nI reviewed the facility’s program statement indicating a ratio of 1:2\nin the short-term shelter program and 1:3 in the treatment\nprogram.\nA staff schedule for dayshift 1/25/24 was provided indicating the\nfacility was working within ratio on that shift.\nInterviews:\nCA stated the ratio of staff to youth is 1:2 in the shelter program\nand 1:3 in the treatment program. To her knowledge, the facility\nhas met their stated ratios in both programs for at least the past\nmonth. CA said they have been mandating three or four staff to\nwork overtime on each shift and a group of new hires are currently\nin training.\nI interviewed Supervisor 3 jointly with Government Worker 1. She\nhas worked at the facility for one year as the midnight shift\nsupervisor. Supervisor 3 said on Sunday 1/21/24, one staff no\nshowed for her shift leaving a floor out of ratio from 2pm – 3:15pm\nuntil Supervisor 3 was able to find coverage.\nAnalysis Supervisor 3 admitted the facility was working out of ratio for\nabout an hour on 1/21/24 dayshift.\nCONSULTATION\nIt is recommended the agency add in the appropriate policy that\ndirect care and supervisory staff are not permitted to leave at the\nend of their shift until they are properly relieved or granted specific\napproval from the administrator.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Criminal history, subject to requirements; staff\nSection qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\n14",
    "Allegation Unidentified Supervisor allows an unidentified youth to have\ncigarettes and a lighter, and to smoke in the bathroom.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nCA said she was unaware of any supervisor or staff allowing a\nyouth to have cigarettes or a lighter. She said no smoking\nparaphernalia was confiscated in the facility in January 2024.\nYouth E denied seeing any youths with cigarettes or smoking in\nthe facility.\nCourtesy Worker interviewed Youth B at the Muskegon County\nJuvenile Transition Center. Asked if the children at Wolverine\nwere allowed to do anything illegal such as smoke or drink, he\nstated \"no\" then started laughing. Asked if he was laughing at the\nquestion, or because he did things, he did not want to tell the\nworker, Youth B responded, \"The second one\". Asked if he\nsmoked at Wolverine, he answered, “Yes” and laughed. He\nrefused to elaborate and would not say how he got an illegal\nsubstance or what staff were working when he smoked. Youth B\nreiterated he did not want to say too much, did not want it written\ndown and that it did not matter.\nAnalysis Youth B claimed he smoked inside the facility, but refused to say\nwhere, when, what or how he managed to smoke. There is no\nevidence anyone allowed Youth B to smoke in the facility.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4125 Personal possessions; money; clothing;\nSection storage space.\nDescription (1) A licensee shall have a written policy that designates all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) The method for ensuring that each resident has sufficient\nclean, properly fitting, seasonal clothing.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The youths went without clean clothes and towels for\napproximately one month.\nInvestigation Onsite inspection\nOn 1/25/24 I observed six functioning washers and dryers, and\nseveral bags of dirty clothes in the basement waiting to be\nwashed.\n15",
    "Interviews:\nCA said the facility has six washers and six dryers. At one point,\nfour of the twelve machines were not working, but they have since\nbeen repaired. During the time the machines were broken, CA\nsaid all youths still had clean clothes and towels.\nSupervisor 3 said to her knowledge, youths have never gone\nwithout clean clothes or towels. They receive new outfits (t-shirt,\nsweatpants, underwear, sweatshirt, and towels) daily or as\nneeded.\nDirector of Operations and Facilities stated youths are responsible\nto bag and set their dirty clothes outside their room to be washed.\nYouth E said youths are supposed to (bag and) set their dirty\nclothes outside their rooms to be washed, “but we don’t.”\nBecause he was non-compliant, he said he once waited a week\nbefore his clothes were washed. “I’d say (to staff) ‘This bitch is\ngetting shut the fuck down, and they would do it,’” he bragged.\nDocument reviewed:\nA printed internal email dated 1/17/24 indicated a washing\nmachine technician was onsite at the facility.\nThere is no written policy describing the laundry procedure.\nAnalysis At one time four of twelve washer and dryers were not working.\nVisual observation and documentation indicated the machines\nhave since been repaired. Since youths are responsible for\nbagging their dirty clothes and setting them in the halls to be\nwashed, some youths do not comply and as a result may go\nwithout clean clothes for longer than necessary.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\n16",

    "summary": "The report details an investigation into multiple allegations at Wolverine Center, a child caring institution. Several allegations, including inadequate heating, lack of cleaning supplies, verbal abuse, and delayed medical care, were not substantiated. However, the investigation did substantiate three violations: a staff member used a prohibited martial arts chokehold on a youth, the facility operated out of its required staff-to-youth ratio for a period, and staff failed to write incident reports as required by internal policy. The culpability lies primarily with the facility's staff and supervision, as evidenced by the use of prohibited physical intervention and failures in procedural compliance.",
