The shelter program\nstatement also indicates “Youth with histories of AWOL may not be\nappropriate.” The two youths both had histories of AWOLing from other\nfacilities prior to their placement at Methodist’s shelter. Furthermore, at the\ntime of this incident both boys had already gone AWOL from the facility at\nleast eleven times. This investigation also cited Rule 104 (2) Rules\ncompliance.

Documentation clearly shows that\nthe youth was not getting his medication as prescribed and did not have all\nof his prescribed medications available. There was a lack of oversight of this\nprocess evidenced by the staff not documenting dispensing on numerous\nentries on the MARs and no one addressing the omissions. Additionally, the\nlack of oversight is evidenced by the staff noting the medication was out on\nthe MARs and in the daily log and no one above the staff level ensuring that\nthe situation was remedied in a timely manner. They were also cited for Rule\n407 Facility and premises maintenance. The bathroom floor did have a large\nhole and floor tiles were loose, creating multiple hazards.

This investigation cited Rule 142 (1) (e)\n(g) Health services policies and procedures. Documentation provided by the\n9",
    "facility, for two youths, showed that not all medications were dispensed as\nprescribed. It also appears that the facility did not ensure that all medications\nwere provided for the youth for a home pass, based on the emails\nexchanged between the mother and the facility. Medication dispensing\nissues have been found repeatedly over the past few months, while the\nfacility was in transition with nurses, so it is critical that the facility\nadministration ensure oversight to this process to avoid further violations.\nAlthough this was a repeat violation for a medication dispensing, additional\nadverse licensing action was not recommended due to the overlapping\ntimeframe of the repeat violation, the recent date for approval of the previous\nCAP, as well as the recent change in Chief Administrator and Director. A\nCAP was submitted 02/21/2022. A nurse was hired in January, trained, and\nhave implemented a new process for filling prescriptions, dispensing\nmedication, and documenting medication dispensing. This CAP is being\nactively monitored during the monthly visits and thus far, the facility is\ncompliant.\nDuring this period the facility was struggling due to staffing issues, change in\nadministrator and director, nurse resigning, and operating the shelter. There was an\nincrease in the number of complaints with several repeated rule violations for staff\nsufficiency and medication refill and dispensing. During this reporting period the\nfacility had an increased number of AWOLs from their shelter and were cited for\naccepting youths outside the terms of their licensing. This resulted in the facility being\nput on a first provisional. There was overlapping timeframe for the repeat violation\nand the date for approval of the previous CAP. The facility has closed the shelter.\nThe facility hired a nurse in January 2022 and is in the process of hiring a second\nnurse to ensure compliance with the rule and CAP regarding medication dispensing\nand refill. The nurse was interviewed and provide a detailed report of the new\nprocess for refiling, dispensing, and documentation of medication. Staff and youths\nwere interviewed and reported no current issues with sufficiency of staff and\nmaintaining ratio.\nMonthly visits have been occurring and the facility is working on implementing the\nCAPs and ensuring compliance. They are focusing on maintaining ratio, medication\nrefill and dispensing, staff supervision, staff training, and following facility policies.\nThe facility is currently fully staffed and are in ratio. They are also working with the\nResidential Collaboration and Technical Assistance Unit (RCTAU) on an action plan\ndeveloped to address challenges the agency was struggling with this reporting\nperiod.\nThis inspection report outlines four violations, with two being repeat violations for TB\ntesting and initial health screen within 24 hours of admission. There were two rule\nviolations for ISP and USP not being signed by social service worker and supervisor,\nwhich was prior to the new Clinical Director being hired. He is working with the clinical\nteam to ensuring compliance with therapy and documentation. During this reporting\nperiod there were only 8 restraints compared to last year they had 42. A walk through\n10",
    "was completed and all the cottages were found to be clean, neat, and no safety\nconcerns. There will be ongoing monthly visits to monitor CAPs follow up to ensure\ncompliance.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy and a\ncorrective action plan is required. The facility was issued a first provisional license\nafter the date of this inspection, but prior to the report being issued. Therefore, this\nreport is not for license renewal. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan,\nthe agency will remain on a First Provisional License.\nApril 21, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 21, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n11"
