She reported the family had only a three-hour warning/notice of the\nremoval. Complainant A reported the children had resided with the foster parents\nsince they were ages one, seven-months and zero respectively. Additionally, that\nprior to the removal, as late as a home visit in November 2019, the agency\nsupported the children’s placement with and adoption by Foster Parent A and Foster\nParent B. The agency completed Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s family\nadoptive family assessment and was recommending them for adoption of the\nchildren. Complainant A reported the emergency removal of the children was not\nmaking sense. Complainant A wondered whether the removal was connected to\nFoster Parent A’s inquiry in November 2019 pertaining to payments for\ntransportation and clothing’s which the foster parents had not received.\n3",
    "Complainant A reported it seems as if the agency just does not want Foster Parent A\nand Foster Parent to adopt the children anymore. She indicated since the children’s\nremoval; the agency has been grappling at straws to show reasons for the removal.\nThe agency has reported that Child 2 was dehydrated and still in pull-ups and has\nused that against Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B. Complainant A reported\nChild 2 was dehydrated because he had stomach flu. Child 2 was in a pull-up\nbecause she put the pull-up on Child 2 because he is four, he was going on a long\nride to a place he didn’t know, with people he didn’t know. She didn’t want him to\nhave an accident. She reported the family still does not know why the agency\nremoved the children.\nComplainant A acknowledged there was a special evaluation initiated against Foster\nParent A and Foster Parent, which is pending. Complainant A reported knowing that\nabuse or neglect has to be a reason for an emergency removal of children from a\nfoster home. Complainant A vehemently denied those issues being something that\nwere occurring by Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B.\nI interviewed Foster Parent A by telephone on 1/17/2020. Foster Parent A affirmed\nthe information as reported by Complainant A. Foster Parent A said, she and Foster\nParent B have cared for the children for over four years; and they had been\napproved to adopt them. The adoptions were targeted to be completed by May 2019,\nbut the date kept changing. A petition was filed but the court discovered their\nfingerprints had expired, needed to be updated. The agency was to do that. Then in\nNovember 2019, a complaint was made against them requiring an investigation.\nFoster Parent A reported the agency also reported that two years ago there was an\nallegation of medical neglect about them, which she didn’t know about. She\nacknowledged that that allegation may, in part, be an aspect of the current special\nevaluation. She reported taking Child 3 to the doctor for failure to thrive years back.\nNow there is concern about her allegedly not taking the child to the emergency room\n(ER) after the doctor’s office was unable to get the child admitted to the hospital. She\nsaid the doctor therein told her to come back tomorrow and take the child to the ER,\nwhich she did. The ER didn’t see what the big issue was. She said the doctor had\nconcerns with the size of Child 3’s head, thinking it was shrinking, but the doctor had\nmeasured Child 3’s head incorrectly. Foster Parent A said she kept her foster care\nworker aware of all of that over the two days that incident went on. She said the\nagency is now alleging she also took the child off pedicure without the physician’s\nconsent and switched doctors. However, she only switched doctors so that all the\nchildren, including her biological son, could be under the care of one doctor, rather\nthan multiple doctors, which was the case with that medical provider. She reported\nnot understanding this all being a complaint now.\nFoster Parent A reported the children were removed on 12/9/2019 around 2:30pm.\nShe did not deny that the agency had contacted them by telephone prior to the\nhome visit. She reported, their licensing worker, Licensing Worker (LW)1, LW 2 who\nwas completing the special evaluation, along with and Foster Care Worker/\n4",
    "Supervisor (FCW/S) C were the staff from the agency. The staff/ agency never gave\nthem a reason for the removal. The staff only said it was in the children’s best\ninterest, but the agency told another state entity, they were concerned with the\nchildren mental health. LW 1 said he didn’t’ support the removal.\nFoster Parent A did not know whether the Michigan Children’s Institute (MCI)\nsuperintendent had given an opinion related to the children’s removal. The agency\ninformed them the agency is not recommending them for adoption. The agency has\nanother family wishing to adopt the children and has “made the comment we’re too\nbusy to adopt”, which is not true. She and Foster Parent B still wish to adopt and\nhave an attorney pursuing adoption of the children.\nChief Administrator A, Foster Care/Adoption Program Manager (FC/APM) B,\nAdoption Worker D, FCW/S C, and LW 1 were interviewed by me on-site on\n1/23/2020. I interviewed Licensing Supervisor M and LW 2 by telephone on\n2/4/2020. Each of these staff denied the allegation.\nEach of the above-listed staff persons reported an emergency family team meeting\n(FTM) was held by telephone on 12/9/2019 with Foster Parent A and Foster Parent\nB. At that time both foster parents were informed of the plan to remove the children\nand the reason for replacing the children.\nChief Administrator A and FC/APM B reported it was accurate that the agency had\napproved the family for adoption and was moving forward with such until a complaint\nallegation was made in July 2019. Then another in November 2019. They reported\nafter a February 2019 complaint/special evaluation on the family had previously\nbeen resolved, MCI consent was requested. MCI consent was obtained for the\nchildren’s adoption around May of 2019 and the agency was one day away from\npetitioning the court for the adoptions when the July 2019 complaint was received,\nalleging physical maltreatment. The MCI superintendent was informed of the matter\nand advised a new MCI consent was required following the successful resolution of\nthe July 2019 complaint investigation. Sometime between the time of the July 2019\ncomplaint and resolution of that special evaluation, the agency discovered one of the\nfoster parents’ fingerprints had expired. Thereafter, the November 2019 foster home\nlicensing complaint was received against Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s\nfoster home. The agency had ongoing consultations with the MCI superintendent,\ninclusive of one on 12/9/2019, where the superintendent supported the removal of\nChild 1, Child 2, and Child 3 from this foster home. Chief Administrator A and\nFC/APM B reported the removal of the children was due to concerns for the\nchildren’s ongoing, safety, care and supervision. That based on information, which\nsurfaced via the adoption worker’s work on the case, pertaining to the children’s\nmedical and emotional needs and the November 2019 special evaluation, removal\nwas assessed in the children’s best interest. The agency staff informed the foster\nparents of the reason for the removal. A Foster Care Review Board (FCRB)hearing\noccurred on the matter on 12/18/2019. The FCRB supported the agency’s action to\nreplace the children.\n5",
    "FCW/S C reported, and Adoption Worker D, Licensing Supervisor M and LW 2\naffirmed that during the telephone call to Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B, on\n12/9/2019, FCW/S C informed the foster parent the call was an emergency FTM to\ndiscuss placement and licensing concerns. Each of these staff members reported\nboth foster parents were on speaker phone, and during the call agency staff took a\nrole in explaining concerns and the agency’s positions related to the placement, the\nlicensing investigation and adoption. FCW/S C reported she advised Foster Parent\nA and Foster Parent B the agency would be replacing the children due to the\nmultiple special evaluations about discipline, the home; new concerns pertaining to\nthe foster parents not following up on the children’s needs, as were uncovered by\nAdoption Worker D; and overall concerns for the children’s ongoing physical and\nemotional safety. FCW/S C advised and arranged for the children’s replacement on\n12/9/2019 at 2:30pm. FCW/S C reported when she, LW 1, and LW 2 arrived at the\nfoster home, the foster parents asked why the children were being removed, and if\nthere was anything, they could do to rectify the situation. Because other people\nwere at the home and emotions were high for the children and family, FCW/S C did\nnot go into the reasons again in detail. She told the foster parents the removal was\nfor reasons outlined to them on the telephone earlier that day. On 12/9/2019, FCW/S\nC provided the foster parents with the Foster Parent Notification of Move(DHS-30)\nform advising them of their right to appeal each respective child’s move and\ndenoting a reason for the move. FCW/S C reported she and LW 2 removed the\nchildren from the foster home. LW 1 stayed behind to answer any questions Foster\nParent A and Foster Parent A might have. Since that time, neither foster parent has\ntried to contact her to asked questions or request clarification.\nAdoption Worker D reported she was assigned Child 1, Child 2 and Child 3’s\nadoption case in October 2019. At that time the adoption was on hold due to a\nspecial evaluation being underway pertaining to the foster home. Sometime during\nthat time, she discovered Foster Parent B’s fingerprints expired/were not processed.\nThe updated prints were needed before the agency could re-apply for MCI adoption\nconsent. Adoption Worker D sent the print for reprocessing on 11/12/2019. Then,\non 11/14/2019 while updating the foster family’s adult references for the updated\nadoption home study, another complaint was received. The complaint alleged\nFoster Parent A smacked Child 1. A special evaluation was therein initiated by the\nlicensing staff. Subsequently, Adoption Worker D’s review of the foster children’s\ncase records and subsequent medical records revealed concerning information\npertaining to Child 3’s failure to thrive, the child’s loss of weight issues, the foster\nparents lack of follow through related to Child 3’s needs and the doctor’s\nadvisements. Information also came out surrounding Foster parent A’s supervision\nand emotional bond or lack thereof with Child 1. Adoption Worker D reported these\nmatters were discussed with the foster parents during the 12/9/2019 telephone FTM\npertaining to the removal. At that time Foster Parent A kept stating “You are\nremoving the children?” “We said, yes.” for the reasons they outlined. Adoption\nWorker D reported the removal of the children was not just that the agency was\nconcerned with the mental health of the children, nor were the foster parents told the\n6",
    "removal was because the foster parents were overwhelmed. Adoption Worker D\nreported during the 12/9/2019 foster home visit, she again informed the family the\nremoval was for the prior specific reasons, inclusive of medical concerns and\nsupervision, discussed with them earlier that day.\nLicensing Supervisor M reported she participated in the12/9/2019 emergency\ntelephone FTM with Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B, at which time she\ninformed them of the licensing staff preliminary findings related to the November\n2019 initiated special evaluation. She indicated at this time the agency will be\nrecommending revocation of the foster home’s license.\nLW 1 reported it was true he was initially not in favor of replacement of the children,\nbut after additional concerns and information emerged, he was. He affirmed his\npresence with Adoption Worker D and LW 2 for the children’s removal from foster\nparent home on 12/9/19. He reported at the request of the foster parents, he stayed\nat the foster home after Adoption Worker D and LW 2 left with the children. The\nfoster parents wanted him to answer questions. They wanted to know the process\nfor appeal. This was his first removal and he couldn’t answer all their questions\nabout that. Additionally, Foster Parent B’s mother, father, and sister, as well the\nfoster parent’s son were present and he was concern about privacy, so he advised\nthe foster parents to call him. The foster parents heard what was explained by the\nagency about the reasons for the replacement. They never reported any concerns of\nnot hearing what was being explained to them during the 12/9/2019 telephone call\nnor referenced such during the home visit.\nI reviewed the DHS-30 form for Child 1, Child 2 and Child 3. All three of the forms\nlisted the reason for removal as item number five: “MDHHS believes it is in the\nchild’s best interest to be moved. Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B signed the\nform for each of the children on 12/9/2019.\nReviewed:\nCase file records which showed:\n Child 1(DOB 5/5/2014), Child 2 (DOB 8/2/2015) were made MCI wards on\n8/31/2018. They are wards of Wayne County.\n Child 3(DOB 9/8/2016) was made an MCI ward on 5/4/2018. She is a MCI\nward of Claire County.\n Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B have been licensed foster parents since\n2015.\n A copy of a 12/23/2019 FCRB’s Appeal Investigation letter to the MCI\nsuperintendent pertaining to a 12/18/2019 FCRB hearing. The document\ndenoted the FCRB supported the agency’s decision to move the children.\n Case documents as referenced earlier in this report.\nA copy of a 12/6/2019 and 12/9/2019 email from Adoption Worker D to the MCI\nSuperintendent, GAL attorneys and others regarding the proposed removal and\ndecision to remove the children from the foster home.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(3) The agency shall document all of the following in the\nchild's record before a change of placement occurs:\n(i) That the current foster parent was notified in writing\nof the following information:\n(i) Not less than 14 calendar days in advance, of the\nchange, except when prior notification would jeopardize the\nchild's care or safety. If prior notice is not provided, then\nthe agency shall notify the foster parent, at the time of the\nchange, why prior notice was not given.\n(ii) Of the current foster parent's rights concerning\nthe change in placement.\nANALYSIS: The evidence does not support the allegation or information as\nreported by Complainant A and Foster Parent A. Foster Parent\nA and Foster Parent B were provided with detail information as\nto why Child 1, Child 2 and Child 3 were being removed from\ntheir care during a telephone call on 12/9/2019. They were also\ninformed of their right to appeal via the DHS-30 Foster Parent\nNotification of Move form on 12/9/2019.\nChild 1, Child 2 and Child 3 are MCI wards and the MCI\nsuperintendent was apprised of actions and concerns pertaining\nto the children’s placement and care. The MCI superintendent\nsupported all three children’s replacements.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nFoster care placement change procedures did not occur.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant A was interviewed by telephone on 1/10/2020. Complainant A reported\nthere was not an FTM related to Child 1, Child 2, and Child 2’s replacement.\nComplainant A acknowledged Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B appealed the\nagency’s removal of the children via the Foster Care Review Board (FCRB), but the\nFCRB sided with the agency. Complainant A reported Child 1’s attorney didn’t know\nabout Child 1’s replacement until the day of my interview with Complainant A. Child\n1’s and Child 2’s attorney sided with the agency related to their replacement.\nFoster Parent A was interviewed by telephone on 1/17/2020. She affirmed the\ncomplainant’s information related to the FCRB and the children’s attorney\ninformation. She reported the FCRB reported they sided with the agency because\nshe hit one of the children, which she reported was accidental. Additionally, that\n8",
    "there were concerns, as reported earlier pertaining the other aspect of the special\nevaluation.\nFoster Parent A did not report that there was or was not an FTM about Child 1, Child\n2 and Child 3’s removal.\nFCW/S C reported, and Adoption Worker D, Licensing Supervisor M, LW 1 and LW\n2 affirmed that an emergency FTM to discuss placement and licensing concerns was\nheld with Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B on 12/9/2019 as previously report.\nDuring a home visit on 12/9/2019, FCW/S C provided the foster parents with the\nDHS-30-Foster Parent Notification of Move form.\nFCW/S C reported she completed the Family Team Meeting Report (DHS-1105) and\nthe Foster Care/Juvenile Action Summary(DHS-69) for each child. She indicated the\nrequired documents were completed timely and updated to MISACWIS at a later\ndate. She reported the DHS-69 was provided to the respective child’s GAL attorney\nvia email on 2/7/2020. The DHS-69 was not sent to the DHHS referring worker\nbecause it was uploaded in MISACWIS. She indicated the court was not notified of\nthe children’s replacement on 12/11/2019 as documented on the form. That was an\nerror. She stated a copy of the DHS-69 notifying Child 1 and Child 2’s court of\njurisdiction of their placement changed occurred via email on 2/7/2020. Child 3’s\ncourt of jurisdiction notification occurred via a court report on 12/20/2019.\nAdoption Worker D reported on 11/18/2019 the MCI superintendent contacted the\nagency regarding the status of the children’s adoption and about concerns related to\nFoster Parent A and Parent B’s new and past special evaluations related to\ndiscipline. A case conference was held with the MCI superintendent in November\n2019. Adoption Worker D reported she invited the children’s Department of Health\nand Human Services (DHHS) Workers and supervisors, Guardian ad litem (GAL)\nattorneys, MCI staff persons and the agency staff to a telephone case conference\nvia email on 11/18/2019. The case conference was set for and held on 11/19/2019\nwith all, except the GAL attorneys, participating in the telephone case conference.\nThe GAL attorneys could not attend. On that same date, Adoption Worker D\nprovided all invitees, the Permanency Resource Manager (PRM) and the other\nstated individuals a written summary of the telephone case conference discussion,\nconcerns and the recommendations made. The agency was to complete the foster\nparents’ special evaluation and to keep the “team members” informed.\nAdoption Worker D reported during the special evaluation further information was\nrevealed regarding Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B and their care of the\nchildren as referenced earlier in this report. On 12/6/2019 Adoption Worker D\nemailed the team members noted above of the agency’s preliminary decision to\nremove the children from the home, as well as, the agency’s anticipated decision of\nnot recommending the foster family for adoption. Another email was sent\nrequesting/scheduling a case conference for 12/9/2019. On 12/9/2019 the agency\nstaff members, the MCI superintendent, PRM Worker and DHHS Worker for Child 3\nattended the telephone case conference. The GAL for Child 3 reported she could not\n9",
    "attend, neither of the children’s GAL attorneys participated. At the telephone\nconference the case was discussed along with the agency’s rationale for removal.\nThe MCI superintendent and team members in attendance at the telephone\nconference agreed with the recommendation and that all three children be removed\nimmediately. Adoption Worker D emailed the conference attendees and all other\npreviously reported “team members” the plan and outcome of the conference.\nAdoption Worker D reported Child 3’s GAL subsequently indicated he did not\nsupport this child’s removal and that he felt he didn’t have opportunity to participate\nin the case conference. She indicated Clair County Court has since asked DHHS to\ninvestigate the agency on this matter.\nI reviewed MISACWIS and social work contact documentations pertaining to the\nstated allegation with respect to Family Teaming Meetings and MISACWIS entry:\n A social work case note documented a telephone FTM on 12/9/2019; and a\nFamily Team Meeting Reports (DHS-1105) for the children all denoted an\nunplanned FTM on 12/9/2019. The DHS-1105 denoted the agency staff in\nattendance in person, and that Foster Parent A, Foster Parent B and LW 2\nwere present via telephone.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nPolicy FOM Family Team Meeting.\n722-06 B\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as outlined in\nthe following tables:\nIf the caseworker and supervisor determine that it is in the\nchild's best interest to change placements:\n An FTM must be held at least three business days prior\nto a best interest placement change to allow interested\nparties the opportunity to participate in the decision; see\nFamily Team Meeting in this item and FOM 722-06B,\nFamily Team Meeting. The supervisor must approve the\nmove before a change of placement is made.\n If the child is an MCI/state ward and the current caregiver\nexpresses either a verbal or written interest in adopting\nthe child, the MCI superintendent must be consulted prior\nto the placement change.\n The caregiver has the option of appealing the decision to\nthe Foster Care Review Board (FCRB); see Caregiver\nAppeal to the Foster Care Review Board in this item.\nANALYSIS: The evidence showed the intent of this policy was met.\n10",

The upload did not occur until 1/23/2020,\nmore than the required three business days.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency did not tell the foster parents what the special evaluation was about or\ninform them they could have a support person present prior to being interviewed.\nINVESTIGATION:\nI interviewed Foster Parent A via telephone on 1/17/2020. She reported the agency\ninformed them in November 2019 that a complaint was made against them. When\nthe agency came out to their home, the agency never told them what the complaint\nwas. When the agency workers were at their home, her in-laws were there, and the\nagency workers would not talk in front of the in-laws. Foster Parent A was not sure\nwhether the agency informed her and Foster Parent B they could have a support\npresent with them when interviewed. However, Foster Parent A stated she knew\nthey could.\nLicensing Supervisor M and LW 2 were interviewed, separately by me, via telephone\non 2/3/2020. Both denied the allegations. They reported the foster parents were\ninformed of the allegations and their right to have a support person. The foster\nparents declined to have a support person.\nLicensing Supervisor M reported she was not on the call when LW 2 spoke with\nParent A and Foster Parent B about receipt of the November 2019 complaint.\nHowever, she had instructed LW 2 to inform the foster parents that a complaint was\nreceived alleging foster home rule violations and to give the foster parents the\ndetails of the complaint at the home visit. She reported that’s what LW 2 did.\nLicensing Supervisor M reported those former instructions were advised so as to\nsafeguard against the foster parents trying to coach or prepare the children prior to\nthe worker interviewing them. Licensing Supervisor M mailed a 11/18/2019 letter\n16",
    "LW 2 wrote to the foster parents. The letter outlined there was a complaint and the\npossible rule violations. The foster parents received that letter prior to LW 2s’\n11/22/2019 home visit. LW 2 reported seeing that letter on the foster family’s table.\nLicensing Supervisor M reported, LW 2 indicated that aside from a neighbor’s son,\nno other outside person was present at the foster home visit; and LW 2 conducted\ninterviews.\nLicensing Supervisor M informed the foster parents of the agency’s preliminary\nlicensing recommendation during the emergency FTM call with Foster Parent A and\nFoster Parent B on 12/9/2019. Prior to that call, Licensing Supervisor M spoke with\nFoster Parent A on 11/19/2019. Foster Parent A left her a message the previous\nday requesting a call. Foster Parent A was upset during the call and expressed\nconcern that Child 1 was the cause of the complaint and that the licensing worker\nwas not coming until 11/22/2019. Foster Parent A stated if the adoption was not\ncompleted by January 2019, she would request that all the children be replaced.\nLW 2 affirmed Licensing Supervisor M’s reporting pertaining to when and how Foster\nParent A and Foster Parent B were informed about the complaint\nallegations/initiation of the special evaluation and the foster parents right to have a\nsupport person. Foster Parent A reported the allegations were crazy. During the\nhome visit on 11/22/2019, Foster Parent A referenced the 11/18/2019 letter that was\nsent them related to the complaint. At that home visit, LW 2 went through each rule\nthe special investigation was investigating and described the complaint alleged\nrelated to each respective rule. LW 2 contacted Foster Parent A on 12/17/2019 and\n1/20/2020, the latter of which she went on the special investigation findings again.\nI reviewed a copy of a 11/18/2019 letter to Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B\nwhich informed the foster parents that a special evaluation had been initiated and\noutlined four foster home rules being investigated. The letter further indicated the\nfoster family is advised, as previously reported in conversation, that they can have a\nsupport person of their choice present for interviews as long as it does not impede\nthe timely completion of the evaluation.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(2) An agency shall inform foster parents of all of the following\nbefore they are questioned or interviewed regarding a special\nevaluation:\n(b) A clear description of the allegations.\n(c) That the foster parents may involve a person of their choice\nin any interviews with them involving the special evaluation if the\ninvolvement does not impede the timely completion of the\nevaluation.\n17",
    "ANALYSIS: Licensing Supervisor M, and LW 2 reported the foster parents\nwere given a detail account of the allegations during a special\nevaluation home visit on 11/22/2019 prior to being interviewed.\nAdditionally, that each foster parent was informed, in writing and\nprior to home visit interviews, of their right to have a support\nperson present, and they declined.\nA 11/18/2019 letter to the foster parents showed written\ndocumentation of the agency informing the foster parents of\ntheir right to have a support person present. Foster Parent A\nalso reported that as a foster parent she knew she could have a\nsupport person.\nThe evidence does not support the allegations. The foster\nparents were informed of (b) and(c) as described by the rule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe agency has not returned the foster parents calls/contacts asking for\nclarifications.\nINVESTIGATION:\nWhile being interviewed by me on 1/17/2020 Foster Parent A reported since the\nchildren were removed from their home, she has tried to reach Chief Administrator A\nand Licensing Supervisor M numerous times but neither will return her calls. She\nreported calling the agency five or six times to speak with them about matters. She\nreported having had four or five foster care worker and two or three adoption\nworkers since placement of the children in 2016. She questioned if that impacted\ntheir case.\nChief Administrator A, FC/APM, FCW/S C, LW 1 and LW 2 all denied having\nreceived a telephone message, email or any contact from Foster Parent A\nrequesting a contact. Adoption Worker D reported reaching out to the foster family\non 12/17/2019 and 1/20/2020 as reported earlier in this report. She denied contact\nfrom either foster parent requesting that she call them following the children’s\nremoval.\nChief Administrator A and FC/APM B reported it’s true the foster family may have\nhad a few worker changes, but it was due to staff leaving the agency. Chief\nAdministrator A reported the last foster worker was terminated in April\n2017.Thereafter, Staff W managed the case as worker and supervisor. Staff W\nwould have been the staff working with, and documenting contacts about the\nchildren. Staff W was terminated from the agency in January 2019 and the case\nremained under the current worker.\n18",
