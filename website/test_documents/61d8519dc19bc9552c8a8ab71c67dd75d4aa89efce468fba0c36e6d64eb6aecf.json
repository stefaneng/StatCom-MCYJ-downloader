    "(1) An agency shall provide an orientation for prospective\napplicants for a foster home license before a foster home\napplication is provided.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not provide an opportunity for a prospective foster\nparent to complete an orientation.\nInvestigation Licensing Supervisor (LS) was interviewed via telephone on\nOctober 19, 2023. He stated he first spoke with the Complainant\nin March 2023. Complainant had contacted Newaygo/Lake DHHS\nand had some general questions regarding fostering and\nadoption. LS stated he had a lengthy conversation with the\nComplainant and answered his questions about the process. LS\nstated the questions were broad and general. Complainant had\nindicated to LS that he was blind and inquired whether or not\nsomeone who is blind would be able to foster or adopt. LS stated\nhe told Complainant that being blind or having a disability does not\nprohibit someone from being a foster parent or adoptive parent.\nLS stated there was some discussion around that and he\nanswered all of Complainant’s questions. LS stated he discussed\nsome of the basic steps that are involved in licensing related to\nthe questions he had; specifically, those relating to an applicant\nwith a disability. LS stated he explained the medical statements\nthat are submitted for applicants. He discussed the preference of\nthe applicant related to child characteristics and how that is\nassessed. Complainant reported to LS that he was only interested\nin infant males that were not circumcised and medically fragile. LS\nstated he discussed that due to the specificity of his preference he\nwas not sure how many children would meet those criteria.\nComplainant reported to LS that he was primarily interested in\nadopting a child. Complainant also reported to LS that he resides\nwith his parents and his parents were not interested in fostering\nand were adamantly opposed to Complainant being a foster\nparent. LS stated there was some discussion regarding all\nhousehold members are assessed and explained the reason\nbehind that. Complainant identified that as a barrier and stated he\nwould have a conversation with his parents regarding his desire to\nfoster or adopt and then would follow up with the agency if he\nwished to pursue further. LS stated he asked Complainant if he\nwas interested in agencies that focus on adoption and he stated\nhe was interested but did not want the information mailed to his\nhome. He reported to LS that he has software on his computer\nthat will read information that is in the body of the email, so LS\nagreed to email some information to him. LS stated he asked\nLicensing Worker 2 to email Complainant with some general\ninformation as well as some information about adoption agencies.\n2",
    "LS stated Complainant did not respond to the email or call the\nagency back.\nLS stated he received an email from an outside agency in July\nindicating the Complainant had contacted them and said he had\nmade attempts to contact Newaygo/Lake DHHS but was not\nreceiving a response. The email also stated Complainant might be\ninterested in orientation and an application. LS followed up with\nthe other agency and indicated they had not heard from the\nComplainant, but they would follow up with him. LS stated he\nasked Licensing Worker 1 to contact Complainant who was able\nto connect with him. LS stated Licensing Worker 1 informed him\nshe spoke with Complainant and was able to answer his\nquestions. Complainant indicated his situation had not changed as\nfar as his living situation and his parents were still opposed to him\nfostering. Complainant also reported the agency could not mail\nanything to the house and no one could come out to his house to\nmeet with him or his family. LS stated when he followed up with\nLicensing Worker 1 regarding her conversation with Complainant,\nComplainant’s focus was on his frustration with lack of housing\noptions.\nLS stated during his communication with Complainant, he\nanswered all of his questions and Complainant did not ask for\norientation or options for orientation. LS stated to his knowledge\nComplainant had not asked Licensing Worker 1 about orientation\nor accommodations for him to be able to complete orientation over\nthe telephone.\nLS stated when individuals contact their agency regarding the\nfostering process it typically starts with answering general\nquestions and if the individual is interested in moving forward, the\nagency will connect them to a licensing worker in order to\ncomplete orientation. Regarding the Complainant, LS stated he\nanswered his questions and Complainant was going to follow up\nwith his parents and let the agency know if he wanted to move\nforward. LS stated there was no conversation with the\nComplainant regarding the orientation process because it never\ngot that far. He stated the Complainant did not indicate he wanted\nto complete orientation and did not identify any barriers for the\norientation process. LS stated the agency would have done all\nthey could to accommodate him.\nLicensing Worker 1 (LW1) was interviewed via telephone on\nOctober 19, 2023. She stated her first interaction with the\nComplainant was approximately 2017 or 2018. He had contacted\n3",
    "the agency and indicated he was interested in fostering an\nuncircumcised male infant. He had indicated that he was blind and\nunable to drive and there was discussion regarding his questions.\nMore recently, LW1 had a conversation with Complainant who\nindicated he is still living with his parents, and they continue to not\nsupport his efforts to foster or adopt and would not cooperate with\nthe licensing process. LW1 explained the first step would be an\norientation and she would come out to his house. She stated she\nwas told by Complainant she was not allowed to send anything to\nhis home or come out to his home. LW1 stated she explained to\nComplainant his parents would need to be on the license because\nthey are in the home. She stated he indicated he was going to\ndiscuss with his parents and let her know but stated he might just\ncontinue to work with another agency he had communicated with.\nLW1 believes he meant the foster care navigator that was\nassisting him. LW1 stated Complainant then asked multiple\nquestions regarding lack of rental options that are available to him\nand felt he was being discriminated against regarding housing.\nLW1 stated Complainant did not request orientation. He had\nasked questions and the process was discussed but he never\nasked for orientation or the options available for him to complete\norientation. The primary focus of the conversation was regarding\nhousing and Complainant’s feeling that he was being\ndiscriminated against regarding housing options. LW1 stated the\nagency will typically conduct orientations at the home of the\nprospective foster parents but has also offered orientation in the\nagency office.\nLicensing Worker 2 (LW2) was interviewed via telephone on\nOctober 19, 2023. She stated LS had a conversation with\nComplainant and asked her to follow up with an email that\nprovided information he had requested. She stated she sent an\nemail to Complainant in March 2023 but did not receive a\nresponse.\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on October 19,\n2023. He stated he initially contacted the agency late summer and\nspoke with LS and asked specific questions regarding the required\npaperwork and his disability. He stated LS told him the agency\nwould not be able to assist him. Complainant stated he was\ninterested in fostering a medically fragile newborn male. His\nultimate goal would be to adopt. He stated LS told him that due to\nhis vision and other medical issues he would not be able to foster.\nHe stated the agency wanted to send documents to him via US\nmail, but he requested email so that he could utilize his document\nreading software and was told they could not email him\n4",
    "information. He stated the agency never sent him anything via\nemail and only sent information via snail mail.\nComplainant stated he asked LS if there was an option to\ncomplete orientation via telephone due to transportation barriers.\nHe stated he is able to set up transportation, but it can be\nchallenging and inquired if he could complete orientation over the\ntelephone. He stated LS stated orientation via the telephone was\nnot an option and he would need to report to the agency in order\nto complete orientation. He stated he attempted to inquire if\norientation could then be completed at his house and was again\ntold that he needed to report to the agency for orientation. He\nstated on the ADA website there is information that certain training\nneeds to be modified to accommodate a disability. He stated he\nexplained to LS that he is not able to physically report to the\nagency.\nHe stated he did not have communication with anyone other than\nLS and a woman whom he could not recall her name or what\nagency she was employed. He could not recall any\ncommunication with LS other than in July.\nHe stated he would like to foster and wants to proceed with\norientation but would need an agency that can accommodate his\ndisability. He would be willing to move forward with Newaygo/Lake\nDHHS if they are willing to work with him. He stated he preferred\nto be the only individual assessed due to his parents being against\nhim fostering but he would do what is necessary and required. He\nstated he never informed the agency he needed to follow up with\nhis parents.\nDuring the investigation Complainant indicated he would like to\nmove forward with the orientation process. A follow up\nconversation with the Chief Administrator and Licensing\nSupervisor occurred on October 27, 2023. They were advised\nComplainant would like to complete orientation. The agency\nindicated they would contact him regarding the next steps. LS had\npreviously indicated during his interview that he would do what he\ncould to accommodate the Complainant.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Email from LW2 to Complainant dated March 28, 2023.\nEmail explained some components of the licensing process\nincluding assessing all household members, obtaining\nmedical clearances and provided Complainant with contact\n5",
    "information regarding adoption agencies that service his\narea.\n• Email from Complainant to LS dated November 7, 2023.\nComplainant confirms receipt of earlier email from LS and\nasks if his orientation can wait until after the holidays.\nResponse sent from LS to Complainant on November 7,\n2023, states it is fine to schedule orientation after the\nholidays. LS asks Complainant to send an email or call him\nwhen he is ready to schedule orientation.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance. Based on completed\ninterviews there is no evidence to support the allegation the\nagency did not offer foster parent orientation to Complainant. The\ncorrespondence that took place between the agency and\nComplainant included answering general questions and providing\nan overview of the licensing process.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended no change to the license status of this child placing agency.\n______November 14, 2023\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 14, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
