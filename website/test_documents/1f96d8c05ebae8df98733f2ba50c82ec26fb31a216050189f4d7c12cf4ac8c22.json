    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms\nof intervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was grabbed inappropriately by staff during an\naltercation.\nInvestigation The complainant was contacted on 02/22/2024 and no additional\ninformation was provided.\nYouth A was interviewed on 02/20/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled the incident in\nquestion. Youth A stated he was already upset that day for\nreasons he could not recall, but this manifested in him throwing\nitems around the pod and attempting to break items. Youth A\nstated there were staff present talking to him but he could not\nrecall who this was. He stated this was after he had been\nattempting to break into locked doors in the open area of the pod\nwith any items he could. Youth A stated he eventually pushed\npast a staff member through an open door to the control room and\nwas able to get his hands on the keys to the doors within the pod.\nHe believed those keys were sitting out on a table in the locked\ncontrol room. Youth A stated staff tried stopping him at this point\nbut he could not recall who this was. Youth A recalled destroying\nproperty once he was inside of the control room. He believed he\nleft the control room and was able to get back in a second time as\nwell. Youth A stated he then chose to stop destroying property\nand slid the keys back to a staff member that he could not recall.\nYouth A stated no staff members put their hands on him during\nthis incident but, they were all attempting to redirect and de-\nescalate him.\nYouth B was interviewed on 02/20/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled the incident in\nquestion involving Youth A. Youth B stated he came out of the\n2",
    "shower area to only have a staff member try to stop him from\nmoving into the common area. He could not recall who this was.\nYouth B stated he moved past this staff member, and their\ninteraction was not physical. Youth B stated he saw Youth A\ndestroying property in the common area of the pod at this point,\nand there was a staff member near him. Youth B could not recall\nwho this staff member was. Youth B recalled seeing Youth A\npush past staff through an already open door to the control room\nof the pod and Youth A then proceeded to destroy property in the\ncontrol room. Youth B stated he attempted to join Youth A. Youth\nB recalled all the other youth in the pod were in their rooms at this\npoint. Youth B stated he was in the control room with Youth A\nwhen Youth A stopped his escalated behavior, gave the keys back\nto staff and exited the control room. Youth B stated he did not see\nany staff members put their hands on Youth A during any portion\nof this incident.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 02/20/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He stated he was called to the pod\nto assist because Youth B was very upset. Staff 1 stated he\naddressed Youth B when he entered the pod and there were no\nother youth in the room other than Youth A and Youth B. Staff 1\nstated Youth B began to destroy property in the pod, including\nattempting to damage security cameras. Staff 1 recalled Youth A\nand Youth B were able to get into the control room of the pod, but\nhe was not sure how this occurred. Staff 1 believed this could\nhave occurred because he and other staff members involved, that\nhe could not name, were trying to move large items from the open\narea to the control room as a means of managing the environment\nfor Youth A and Youth B. Moving the large items would have\nprevented the youth from attempting to damage those items or\nhurting themselves. However, this allowed the youth to push into\nthe normally locked and off limits area. Staff 1 did recall Youth A\nhad the keys to the control room and gave them back to a staff\nmember upon de-escalating. Staff 1 stated a restraint attempt\nwas made with Youth A where he and Staff 2 attempted to hold\nYouth A with arms hooked and all three of them standing. Staff 1\nstated Youth A almost immediately dropped to the ground and\nboth he and Staff 2 released their arms and were able to stay\nstanding. Staff 1 stated this was the extent of any restraint\nattempts in which he participated or witnessed during the incident.\nAfter that, the youth were able to be verbally de-escalated and\nthey both stopped destroying property and were not in the control\nroom any longer.\n3",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed on 03/18/2024 over the phone. He stated\nhe was working with Youth A and Youth B as they both started to\ndestroy property on the pod on the day in question. Staff 2 stated\nthe youth were trying to get into locked areas of the pod and\neventually one of them hit a security camera mounted on the wall.\nStaff 2 recalled Staff 1 attempting to move some items from out in\nthe open into the control room when Youth A pushed past him into\nthe normally locked and off limits area. Staff 2 recalled Youth A\nwas destroying property in the control room for a few minutes and\nhe and Staff 1 attempted to manage the environment without\nhaving to attempt a restraint of him. Staff 2 stated Youth A\ngrabbed a set of keys off of a desk while in there, but eventually\ngave them back to Staff 2. Staff 2 stated he was able to do this by\nholding Youth A’s wrist and grabbing them out of his hand. Staff 2\nrecalled Youth A not struggling or resisting when he attempted\nthis. At this time both Youth A and Youth B were somewhat de-\nescalated and the property damage to the control room ceased.\nSupervisor 1 was interviewed on 03/18/2024 over the phone. He\nstated that he was present when Youth A and Youth B began to\ndestroy property in the pod. He recalled Youth A was able to push\npast other staff into the control room of the pod. Supervisor 1\nstated the staff involved, which he could not specifically recall, had\ntheir backs turned to Youth A but Youth A overpowered them and\npushed into the room without staff putting their hands on him. It\nwas at this point that Youth A grabbed a set of keys from a desk.\nSupervisor 1 recalled Youth A and Youth B destroying property in\nthe control room for a few minutes only for them to stop on their\nown accord and leave the room on their own accord. Supervisor 1\nbelieved this occurred because Youth B told Youth A they could\nbe done, and Youth A followed Youth B’s direction. Supervisor 1\nstated Youth B later asked if he could help with the cleanup of the\nmess that was created.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Video footage of the incident in question was shared.\nYouth A and Youth B can be seen attempting\nunsuccessfully to open two separate locked doors within\nthe pod and staff address them without putting their hands\non the youth. Neither youth particularly escalated at this\npoint. Eventually Youth B can be seen throwing a chair up\nat the security camera and hitting it, effectively ending the\navailable footage.\n• An Incident Report dated 02/15/2024 was provided and\nreviewed. This document provided consisted details with\nyouth and staff interviews, including Youth B damaging the\n4",
    "security camera, Youth A and Youth B gaining access to\nthe control room of the pod past Staff 1 and then destroying\nproperty.\n• Pictures of the damaged items in the pod and control room\nwere provided.\n• Facility policy titled “The SJJS Behavior Management\nSystem” was provided and reviewed. It is noted that “a\nsafe physical intervention shall be used only as a last\nresort, after all other methods of non-physical intervention\nhave been exhausted.”\n• Facility policy titled “Youth Supervision” was provided and\nreviewed. Of note it described a policy that staff “shall\nremain alert to items that could be used as weapons (e.g.\nelectrical cords and broomsticks) and place/store them in\nlocations where youth do not have access.”\n• Training records for Staff 1 and Staff 2 were provided and\nno concerns were noted.\n• No discipline was noted for either Staff 1 or Staff 2.\nAnalysis Through interviews with youth and staff and documentation\nreviewed there was no evidence found that there was any form of\nhitting or pushing of Youth A or Youth B during this incident. In\naddition, there were no facility policies broken during the\nmanagement of the youth involved.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
