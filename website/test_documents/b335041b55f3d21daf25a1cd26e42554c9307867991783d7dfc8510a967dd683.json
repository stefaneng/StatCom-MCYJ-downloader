They are left in there for 3-4 hours during periods that should only be\nfor approximately 1 hour.\n3",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nComplaint was received 06/07/21 and transferred to DCWL for investigation and\nincluded the following allegations:\nThe children at the Calumet Center are being left in their rooms for long periods\nof time due to understaffing. The children are being left in their rooms for 3-4\nhours at a time when it should only be for about an hour during the day.\nI attempted to interview the complainant on 06/09/21, but they did not respond.\nI interviewed Manager 1 at the facility on 06/09/21. Manager 1 reported that the\nstaffing was in ratio as of this morning but shift change was just happening, so she\nwas not certain whether they had adequate coverage for the afternoon. Manager 1\nsaid that there are times when they are understaffed and not in ratio. Manager 1 said\nthat when there are DHHS youth are on a pod the ratio is 1:5 and others are 1:9.\nI met with Director 1 on 06/09/21 at the facility. Director 1 said that staffing is “tight”\nat the facility. Director 1 reported the ratios to be 1:5 for DHHS youth and 1:8 for\nothers. Director 1 assisted with a tour of the facility to include several pods so that\nratio could be verified. One pod with DHHS youth was observed to have more than\nfive youth but only one staff.\nI interviewed Youths B, C, and D at the facility on 06/09/21. All three youth were\nfrom different pods. All three youths reported that the facility does not always have\nenough staff. The youth said that they are sometimes locked in their rooms in\nmornings and during shift change for longer times due to being short staffed. All\nthree youths said that the previous weekend was understaffed which resulted in the\nyouth remaining in their rooms for hours longer than they are supposed to be, and\nalso results in them missing some programming and level privileges (gym time,\nstaying up later). It was additionally reported by Youths C and D that one staff has\nmonitored two pods due to short staffing.\nI spoke with the Chief Administrator at the facility and discussed the concerning\nreports related to understaffing.\nI discussed the staffing with the Chief Administrator, CEO, Director 1, Director 2, and\nmy Area Manager via a Teams conference call. The facility administration\nacknowledged that the staffing is limited, that there have been times when ratio was\nnot met, and reported on their efforts to hire additional staff.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 06/17/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Staff\n1 reported that the facility is staffed out of ratio at times. Staff 1 said that this occurs\nat least two times per week. Staff 1 was asked what the ratio was and reported 1:9\nfor the county kids and did not know for the DHHS kids. Staff 1 reported that there\nare days when one staff has to monitor more than 9 kids. Staff 1 said that youth are\n4",
    "usually let out of rooms after morning headcount, which is around 7:00am. Staff 1\ndid not know what time youth go to bed.\nI interviewed the Supervisor on 06/17/21 at the facility, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The Supervisor reported that the facility is “definitely understaffed” but\nthey have been in ratio during the Supervisor’s shifts.\nDuring a 06/17/21 Placement Collaboration Unit call related to this allegation, it was\nreported by multiple placing workers that their youth have reported being kept in\ntheir locked rooms for hours, and especially on the weekends. One worker reported\nthat their youth reported not receiving programming due to staffing issues. Two\nworkers specified that facility staff acknowledged staffing issues directly to them.\nFollow up emails were exchanged with one of the workers on the call. The worker\nexpanded on her report that one of her youth who is placed at the facility reported\nthat the youth are kept in the locked rooms for long five hour stretches on weekends\nbecause of staffing issues.\nI conducted unannounced visits to the facility on 06/09/21 and 06/17/21 and\ninterviewed a random sample of staff and youth during both visits. Multiple youth and\nstaff reported ongoing issues with understaffing and indicated that the facility is not\nalways able to meet ratio.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\no Calumet Residential Daily Census\no Facility policy Youth Supervision & Staffing. The policy notes staffing ratios\nduring ‘normal, waking hours, shall be no less than one worker to five\nresidents (1:5 for DHHS/JJ Youth); no less than one worker to eight residents\n(1:8 for CMO/SJJS youth).’ Additionally, the policy notes that during sleeping\nhours the ratio is one worker to ten residents.\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as evidenced by multiple youth and\nstaff reports of understaffing leading to times when the facility is\nnot able to meet their ratio, as well as an observation of one pod\nbeing out of ratio during a facility walk through.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is advised that the administration review the ratio policy with\nstaff to ensure that all staff are aware of the correct numbers\nsince some staff reported incorrect ratio numbers.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nOne youth is being denied medical treatment for pain.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplaint was received 06/07/21 and transferred to DCWL for investigation and\nincluded the following allegations:\nAn unknown female resident is being denied the right to see medical staff when\ncomplaining of pain. It is not known what kind of pain she is experiencing.\nI attempted to interview the complainant on 06/09/21, but they did not respond.\nA second complaint was made regarding Youth A and was received on 06/11/21.\nThis complaint was assigned to the DHHS Specialist for joint investigation. The\nallegations in the second complaint were:\nYouth A (17) resides at Spectrum Human Services Calumet Center. Youth A has\nbeen to the ER at Children Hospital in Detroit, MI three times in the past 10 days.\nYouth A presents in the ER due to having Styrofoam and cotton balls in her\nurethra. Youth A is supposed to be under a one-on-one protocol in the facility.\nHowever, Youth A is being monitored via video while at the facility. Youth A gets\nthe Styrofoam and cotton balls while eating and taking medications. Youth A has\nmental health concerns. Youth A is suicidal and is putting the objects in her\nurethra in an attempt to harm herself.\n6",
    "I met with Director 1 at the facility on 06/09/21. Director 1 reported that Youth A has\nbeen at the facility for over a year and is presently on suicide precautions due to her\nemotional and behavioral issues, including putting objects in her urethra. She was\nrecently seen at the hospital, and this is not the first time this has occurred. Director\n1 acknowledged that Youth A recently reported to him that she was having pain, and\nhe requested that she receive an exam.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 06/09/21. Youth A reported to have put five\npieces of foam cup in her urethra previously and had to have it removed at the\nhospital. Youth A said she put cotton inside her today and noted that she was in pain\nagain. She reported that she does this to hurt herself and she wants to kill herself.\nYouth A reported that has done this multiple times. Youth A indicated that she does\ntell the staff, but per her interview, this does not always occur immediately. Youth A\nstated that on one recent occasion she told Director 1 and was seen by the nurse\nthe next day and was sent to the doctor, where she had an operation to have the\nitem removed. Youth A reported that she does meet with a therapist at the facility but\ndid not feel it was helping her.\nI met with the Chief Administrator (CA) on 06/09/21 at the facility and discussed the\nconcerns related to Youth A. The CA reported that she was aware of Youth A’s\nstatus and her putting objects in her body. The CA reported that the facility has\nreplaced about a dozed mattresses due to Youth A picking the mattress until she\ncan get some string or cotton off of it. Youth A then self-harms with the material. Per\nthe CA, Youth A has done the same with the suicide vests provided to her and\nStyrofoam cups. The CA said that she is currently seeking out indestructible cups\nand plates to assist in keeping Youth A safe.\nI met with Director 2 at the facility on 06/17/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nDirector 2 reported being aware of Youth A’s suicidal and self-harming behaviors\nand that she puts objects inside her body. It was reported that the facility has\nreplaced 11 or so mattresses due to Youth A pulling threads out so that she can\naccess the cotton and put in inside her body. Youth A was also reported to have\npulled apart the facility suicide vests, grabs and hides anything she can, such as,\nshampoo caps, paper, etc. That is why she has been kept on suicide precautions.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows:\n Youth A file review inclusive of medical documentation (both facility\ndocumentation and outside documentation), safety plan, and related\ndocumentation.\n Related facility Incident Reports dated 06/3/21, 06/08/21, 06/09/21, and\n06/10/21.\n Hospital discharge paperwork, 06/30/2021. Indicated that Youth A continued\nto insert various objects into her urethra, vagina, and nose while in hospital\ncare. This occurred while being supervised by one facility staff and one\nhospital sitter, and some while mechanically restrained to the bed.\n7",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservice policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with this rule. Youth A reported that\nwhen she advised staff at the facility that she inserted objects\ninto her body and that she was in pain, that she received\nmedical treatment. A record review also found that Youth A\nreceived medical treatment several times for this issue.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A has been to the hospital three times in ten days due to putting objects inside\nher body. Youth A is on one-on-one supervision at the facility but is only being\nmonitored via camera.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA second complaint was made regarding Youth A and was received on 06/11/21.\nThis complaint was assigned to the DHHS Specialist for joint investigation. The\nallegations in the second complaint were:\nYouth A (17) resides at Spectrum Human Services Calumet Center. Youth A has\nbeen to the ER at Children Hospital in Detroit, MI three times in the past 10 days.\nYouth A presents in the ER due to having Styrofoam and cotton balls in her\nurethra.

Youth A gets\nthe Styrofoam and cotton balls while eating and taking medications. Youth A has\nmental health concerns. Youth A is suicidal and is putting the objects in her\nurethra in an attempt to harm herself.\nI met with Director 1 at the facility on 06/09/21 and he assisted with a tour of Youth\nA’s pod and the control room. In the control room I observed a small monitor with a\ncamera view of Youth A in her bedroom.\nI met with Director 2 at the facility on 06/17/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. I\nasked Director 2 about a request for a random sample of videos of staff checking on\nYouth A to compare to the eyes-on checks forms. Director 2 reported that he\n8",
    "reviewed the requested videos of the staff checks and found that some staff were\nonly using the camera to check on Youth A instead of going to her room and\nchecking on her. Director 2 reported that staff know better and that they have been\ntrained and directed that the checks need to be done in person at the youth’s door.\nI interviewed Manager 1 at the facility on 06/17/21 jointly with the DHHS Specialist. I\nreviewed the suicide precautions logging forms for Youth A with Manager 1 and\nasked about 06/04/21, when the log noted she was on duty but there was missing\ndocumentation of eyes-on checks from 11:25am-11:55am. Manager 1 said that she\nmust have went to use the restroom and the person who relieved her did not fill in\nthe checks. Manager 1 did not recall who relieved her. Manger 1 reported that she\nused to sit by Youth A’s door when she worked on that unit. Manager 1 also reported\nthat she and other staff do checks both in person and via the camera monitor in the\ncontrol room.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 06/17/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist at the facility. Staff\n1 reported that she usually sits with Youth A for a while when she works on that pod.\nStaff 1 reported that she visually does checks during her rounds on the pod. Staff 1\nreported that she also does checks via the camera in the control room, but this is\nusually when Youth A is asleep. Checks were reported to be done every five\nminutes.\nI interviewed the Supervisor on 06/17/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist, at the\nfacility. The Supervisor reported that she and staff do checks for Youth A both face\nto face and via the camera in the control room.\nDocumentation reviewed during this investigation is as follows:\n Suicide precautions policy:\no III Procedure:\n A. 2. …Youth observation will be logged at intervals not to\nexceed 5 minutes.\n E. Staff: 2. Using the level of precautions directed by the Facility\nManager on the Suicide Precautions Initial Level Form, staff\nshall implement the level of suicide precautions as follows: b.\nMonitoring of the youth will be logged using the Suicide\nPrecautions Form at 5-minute intervals.\n Suicide precautions logging forms for Youth A, 06/04/21-06/10/21. The\nfollowing was observed:\no 06/04/21-Missing eyes-on checks from 11:25am-11:55am.\no 06/06/21-Missing eyes-on checks from 9:05am-10:55am.\n9",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4161 Seclusion rooms; policies and procedures.\nAn institution approved to use a seclusion room shall\nestablish and follow written policies and procedures\nspecifying its use. The policy shall include, at a minimum,\nall of the following provisions:\n(e) Staff shall observe the resident at intervals of 15\nminutes or less and shall record the observation in a\nseclusion room log. Video surveillance shall not be the only\nmeans of observation.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule evidenced by the missing\ndocumentation of checks on the youth. The facility policy calls\nfor 5-minute checks and multiple daily logs did not document all\nchecks were completed. Additionally, the staff reported not\nalways doing face to face checks and stated that they use the\ncamera for checking on the youth. This was also reported by the\nDirector, who said that he reviewed video of staff doing checks\nand found that some staff were checking Youth A via video only\nand not going over to her room.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe facility documentation did not contain all of the required hourly supervisory\napprovals for ongoing seclusion due to self-harming/suicidal behaviors.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDocumentation reviewed during this investigation is as follows:\n Suicide precautions policy:\no III Procedure:\n F. Shift Supervisor: 3. The shift supervisor shall review the\nstatus of each youth on suicide precautions in person, on an\nhourly basis, indicating this review by initialing in the\nsupervisor’s block on the Suicide Precautions Logging Form. 4.\nNew Suicide Precautions Logging Forms shall be started at\n12:00am of each day and be given to the Youth Worker\nmonitoring the youth on suicide precautions. The previous day’s\nform will be collected, copied, and filed. The original log will be\nfiled with the Facility Manager and a copy will be immediately\nsubmitted to the Center Director.\n10",
    " J. Center Director: The Center Director shall monitor the daily\nstatus of youth under suicide precautions and ensure that\nappropriate steps have been taken to provide for the safety of\nthe at-risk youth.\n Suicide precautions logging forms for Youth A, 06/04/21-06/10/21. The\nfollowing was observed:\no 06/04/21-Missing supervisory approval from 9:40pm-11:55pm.\no 06/05/21-Missing supervisory approval from 9:00pm-11:55pm.\no 06/06/21-Missing supervisory approval from 6:00am-11:55am.\no 06/07/21-Missing supervisory approval from 3:00pm-11:55pm.\no 06/08/21-Missing supervisory approval from 11:00pm-11:55pm.\no 06/10/21-Missing supervisory approval from 11:00pm-11:55pm.\no One form contained no name, date, or other information. Eyes-on\nchecks were documented, but no supervisory approval was done at all\nfrom 12:00pm-11:55pm.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4162 Seclusion rooms; administrative oversight.\n(4) For each instance in which a resident remains in the\nroom for more than 2 hours, the log shall contain hourly\nsupervisory approval and the reasons for continued use.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as hourly supervisory approval did not\noccur for the ongoing seclusion. The facility policy notes that\nsupervisors will do hourly in-person checks and document the\nchecks by initialing the form. This was observed not to have\nalways occurred in the observation forms reviewed as noted\nabove. Also, the facility policy notes the Center Director receives\ncopies of the forms and is responsible to monitor the process,\nhowever, the forms were not addressed as incomplete, and the\nDirector did not know that staff were using video only to monitor\nthe youth in some cases.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n11",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting a timely\nand acceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\n07/21/2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n12"
