During the 2022 interim review\nthe agency had six violations regarding home visits, staff training, treatment plan\nsignatures, case contact entry, family team meetings, and action summaries. The\nagency reported successful implementation of their CAP during the past year.\nThey have shown significant improvement in most areas of the CAP.

The Chief\nAdministrator (CA) indicated the agency has worked hard to come into compliance\nwith CAP items from the 2022 review.

Identifying placements for certain youth has been\na state-wide issue.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.",

A foster care case\nmanager was interviewed and stated she currently has the best supervisor she\nhas ever had. Her supervisor is supportive, knowledgeable, helpful, and always\navailable. The worker noted the job can be very difficult, but she has the right\namount of support. None of the staff had any concerns or suggestions for\nimprovement within the agency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the county building in Adrian.

The\nsafety alert was resolved when the pool was drained, and the foster parent agreed\nit will not be filled again until the agency has verified compliant safety barriers are in\nplace.\nVIII.
