Since the summer of 2024, the center has\nbeen infested with bedbugs. The center has tried to remedy the\nissue, but the bedbugs are still present. The bedbugs crawl on the\nfurniture, couches, and other staff members.\nInvestigation Chief Administrator (CA), Independent Living supervisor (IL\nsupervisor) and Director of Foster Care Services were\ninterviewed together via Teams on December 12, 2024. IL\nsupervisor stated the agency first became aware they may have a\nbed bug issue on August 23, 2024. A youth in the IL home was\nworking at Salvation Army and they believe he brought bed bugs\nin because he had made comments about itching and having a\nfew bite marks upon returning from work.\nIL Supervisor stated the agency contacted a company named\nErlich. Erlich entered the request for extermination services into\nthe system and it is contracted out to whatever exterminator in the\narea accepts the bid and is willing to complete the job. Erlich\ncame out on August 26, 2024, and completed a walkthrough of\nthe bedrooms, common areas and checked all furniture. Bed bugs\nwere found to be in the youth’s bedroom only and were not found\nin other locations. The agency bombed the building and Erlich did\nan initial spray on August 29, 2024. On September 7, 2024, Erlich\nbrought dogs to the agency who are trained to detect bed bugs. At\nthat time, the company found 3 areas of concern. It was\nrecommended to spray, and the company indicated heat\ntreatment was not needed. Spray treatment was completed on\nSeptember 13, 2024, that included the 3 areas of concern. During\nthe week of September 16, 2024, the agency ripped out all the\ncarpet in the common areas and installed hardwood floors. All of\nthe furniture has also been replaced.\nIL Supervisor stated there were no concerns for awhile since the\ntreatment was completed mid-September, however they were\n2",

It was\ndetermined there were 3 bedrooms that were identified and an\narea in the common area. On December 10, 2024, the agency\nmade arrangements to have an exterminator come out again. IL\nSupervisor stated the agency is in the process of moving all youth\nto a different cottage in order to fully exterminate Nichols cottage.\nHe stated the agency is doing preventative measures based on\nrecommendations from the exterminator such as going to the\nlaundromat to dry clothes on high heat prior to reentering the\nbuilding and alcohol spray bottles to spray clothes.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• August 23, 2024: Initial bed bug notification. Work order\ncreated. Erlich Pest Control contacted and reported to\nNichols Cottage to begin treatment. Erlich conducted a\nfollow up assessment on August 26, 2024, and found no\nissues.
