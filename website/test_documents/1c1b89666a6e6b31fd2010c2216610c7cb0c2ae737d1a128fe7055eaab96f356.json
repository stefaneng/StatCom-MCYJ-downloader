    " Youth A’s Hygiene Plan\n CAP for investigation 2020C0108062 completed 9/24/20\nAll interviews were completed face to face at the facility. They were completed on\n12/9/20. Youth A was discharged on 12/8/20.\nDue to multiple allegations, each allegation will be addressed individually.\nAllegation 1: Staff are being too rough with Youth A. Other youth are bullying\nYouth A and staff are not doing anything.\nI interviewed Youth B, Youth C, Youth D, and Youth E. All reported that staff are not too\nrough with the youth. All reported that staff intervene when youth are arguing with each\nother.\nStaff 1, Youth Care Worker, reported no one ever hurt Youth A. Staff 1 reported youth A\nwas not bullied.

    "Staff 1, Youth Care Worker, Supervisor 1, and Therapist 1 reported Youth A would not\ntake his medication for eczema all the time.\nStaff 1 and Supervisor 1 reported he did take his medication sometimes.\nI reviewed the MAR report for October, November, and December. The MAR report only\nnoted three attempts made to give Youth A his medication for eczema.\nI reviewed the Medication Control and Administration Procedures Policy:\nAll WHS staff that are trained to administer medication will document the\nfollowing:\nClient Name, Medication and dosage administered, time and date of\nadministration, and any client refusals. This is documented on an electronic\nmedication administration record (QuickMAR) in the client record.\nAllegation 5: Youth A’s hygiene needs are not being met, specifically hair care.\nI reviewed SIR 2020C0108062 and subsequent CAP. A Hygiene Plan was created.\nI reviewed the specific hygiene plan for Youth A created on 9/24/20 until 12/8/20:\n Staff will direct Youth A to brush his hair if needed. Staff will log if refused or if he\nattempted…\n Youth A will be given the opportunity to shower each night…will repeat if\nnecessary…staff will log shower times and attempts\n All information regarding Youth A’s personal hygiene will need to be logged each\nhour. After completion or refusal of steps in this plan will need to be logged in his\nhygiene log.\nI reviewed his hygiene log. The logging was not completed in its entirety. There are\nmultiple days that do not have any logging noted and there are days where logging is\nsporadic and not completed throughout the day.\nI reviewed the Updated Treatment Plan, specifically under Life Skills for 8/16/20-\n11/14/20. The treatment plan discusses the development and implementation of the\nhygiene log. The logging is to be completed daily. It will log “prompting, demonstration,\nand completion or non-completion of all hygiene tasks…”\n4",
