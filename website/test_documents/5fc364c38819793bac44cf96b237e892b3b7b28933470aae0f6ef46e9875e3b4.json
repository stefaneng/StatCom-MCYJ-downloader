    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was able to leave secure facility.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was spoken with on 10/3/24 via phone and did\nnot have any further information.\nYouth A is non-verbal and could not be interviewed. He was\nseen face to face at the facility on 10/8/24, and no concerns were\nnoted for his safety or well-being.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n10/8/24. Supervisor reported she went outside to the front parking\nlot at 2:00 pm to get another youth off the bus. Supervisor\nreported the other youth was being non-compliant, so she was\nstanding on the bus waiting. While Supervisor was on the bus, she\nlooked over and saw Youth A in the front parking lot. Supervisor\nnoticed there were no staff in the parking lot with Youth A, so she\ngot off the bus to check on him. When she approached him, she\ndid a once over of his physical condition to ensure he didn’t have\nany injuries since he is non-verbal. Supervisor saw Staff 3 leaving\nfor the day, so Supervisor asked Staff 3 to call for assistance.\nSupervisor reported after assistance was called, Staff 1 came\nrunning around from the back of the building. Supervisor reported\nshe was able to deduce Youth A must have escaped from one of\nthe back doors of the building. Supervisor reported a couple of the\ndoors hit and latch immediately, but the hallway door takes a\nsecond to latch. Supervisor reported staff need to concentrate on\ndouble checking the door when closing it to ensure the latch\nclicks.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 10/8/24.\nStaff 1 reported she and Youth A were heading towards the\nclassroom. Youth A was non-compliant and wouldn’t enter the\nclassroom because he doesn’t like loud noises and there was a\nnoisy peer in the classroom. Staff 1 reported Youth A remained in\nthe hallway outside the classroom and Staff 1 reported she was\nprompting him every 5-10 seconds to come inside the classroom.\nStaff 1 reported Youth A’s behavior plan is to prompt him every 5-\n10 seconds to be compliant, but if he doesn’t follow the prompts,\nhe can be in the hallway for up to 15 minutes by himself. Staff 1\nreported she went into the classroom to check on Youth A’s peers.\nStaff 1 reported within a couple minutes, she went back into the\nhallway and Youth A was gone. Staff 1 reported Staff 2 was\nwalking in the hallway and Staff 1 asked Staff 2 if he knew where\nYouth A was. Staff 2 told Staff 1 he didn’t know. Staff 1 reported\n2",
    "she began checking all the doors and found all of them to be\nlocked except for the hallway door leading outside. Staff 1\nreported since the hallway door wasn’t fully latched, she went\nrunning outside and found Youth A in the front parking lot with\nSupervisor, Staff 3 and Staff 4. Staff 1 reported there have been\nmany workorders put in for the hallway door leading outside to be\nfixed, and it’s been worked on but never properly fixed. Staff 1\nreported the hallway door might look like it’s shut, but sometimes it\ndoesn’t latch all the way.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 10/8/24.\nStaff 2 reported he went into the classroom to the help because\ntwo youth were escalated. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was working\nspecifically with Youth A. Staff 2 reported Youth A wouldn’t come\ninto the classroom, so Staff 1 checked on Youth A in the hallway\nseveral times. Staff 2 reported he had to use the restroom, so he\nwalked into the hallway with Staff 1 and Staff 1 said she didn’t\nknow where Youth A was. Staff 2 told Staff 1 to double check the\ngym, restrooms, and other rooms. Staff 2 told Staff 1 if she still\ncouldn’t find Youth A when he got back to let him know. Staff 2\nreported when he got out of the restroom, he saw a staff running\noutside with Youth A’s tablet. Staff 2 reported he went outside and\nsaw multiple staff in the front parking lot with Youth A. Staff 2\nreported the door in the hallway has a magnetic lock instead of a\npiston lock, so he’s heard from staff if the door isn’t pulled shut, it\ndoesn’t always fully latch.\nTOUR OBSERVATION:\nA tour of the facility occurred on 10/8/24. Walked around the\noutside perimeter of the facility. Chief Administrator (CA) opened\nback double doors to demonstrate the issues with the door closing\nautomatically. Took pictures and a video of the concern. Viewed\nthe distance from the classroom door to the door leading outside\nas well as the distance from the door leading outside to the front\nparking lot.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Agency Response Plan dated 10.7.24 written by Chief\nAdministrator (CA) states they will be retraining staff on\nAWOL procedures and will be getting a new locking\nmechanism for the door. CA noted the door has a piston\nthat will not always go down, resulting in the door staying\nslightly ajar though it should automatically lock.\n• Program Statement states the program is designed to be a\nsafe, secure environment for children with Autism who\n3",
    "display challenging behavior, that has a history of leading\nto harm to self or others, to receive intensive behavioral\ntreatment.\n• Supervision policy states the facility will ensure an\nappropriate level of staff on-duty and an appropriate level of\nsupervision within each established supervision zone.\nAdditional supervision requirements for an individual may\nbe added through an individualized plan of service\nsupervision guidelines document.\n• Youth A’s Supervision Guidelines document dated 3.8.24\nstates during awake hours, Youth A may move freely about\nthe center and recreation area if staff are aware of his\nwhereabouts and a visual observation is completed at least\nevery 15 minutes.\n• Incident report authored by Staff 1 dated 10.2.24 is\nconsistent with her interview.\n• Incident report email authored by Supervisor dated 10.2.24\nwas consistent with her interview.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance as per interviews\nconducted, tour observation conducted, and documentation\nreviewed, the agency is a secure facility, and a youth was able to\nexit the facility without supervision due to a faulty door.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nOctober 31, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 31, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
