    "No consultation was offered.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere was one incident of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nSpecial Investigation 2019C0102002 and a joint DHHS investigation found an\ninappropriate relationship between a female staff and a male resident. A corrective\naction plan was approved on 05/08/2019. A second CAP requested and received on\n07/27/2020 reviewing three incidents. The reports were 2019C0102002 and\n2019C0102015. These special investigations involved adult staff being sexual toward\nresidents. The second CAP outlined training on boundaries, supervising employees\ncloser, and training on Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). Also, a dedicated trainer\nto observe resident-staff inaction.\nThe facility has submitted eight acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nDuring the licensing period there were seven additional special investigations\nwhich required corrective action plans:\n 2018C0102026 cited rule CCI145 for not providing a needed medical exam after\na restraint injury. The CAP requires that all residents that are restrained will be\nexamined by the on-site nurse.\n 2019C0102015 cited rule CCI112(1) involved a male staff sending an\ninappropriate picture to a discharged resident. A second CAP was requested and\nreceived on 07/27/2020.\n 2019C010218 cited CCI142(1) when residents were “cheeking” medications and\nsharing them with other residents. The CAP focused on improving training and\nprocedures regarding the dispensing of medications.\n 2019C0102025 cited CCI127(4) and rule CCI148 which involved 15-minute room\nchecks and attending to residents’ personal hygiene. The CAP outlined training\nand discipline to adhere to these rules.\n 2019C0102030 cited rule CCI163(2)(a) for having a resident in seclusion beyond\n72 hours. The CAP was to review this rule at weekly team meeting and have all\nstaff sign off on the meeting minutes.\n 2019C0214043 cited the facility for CCI142 Health Services, JR3 302 Behavior\nHealth Delivery, and CCI165(1) Lockdown. The CAP addressed Health Services\nby changing procedures and creating new forms. The CAP for Behavioral Health\ninvolved hiring a second Social Worker. The CAP regarding Lockdown will\nincrease the number of “float” positions and change the work hours of the group\nleaders.\n 2020C0102002 cited rule CCI159(1) following policy to report restraints in\nMiSACWIS (Michigan Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System).\n5",
    "The CAP provided that all supervisors will be responsible to enter restraints into\nMiSACWIS.\nThe interim inspection completed on 09/25/2019 cited the following: Rule CCI113(g)\nwhere the facility is required to do an evaluation of any Staff member’s criminal\nconvictions. The CAP was to complete the required document and monitor for future\nneed of evaluations. There was no repeat violation regarding rule CCI113(g). The\nCAP for Rule CCI114 tuberculosis screening changed the procedure to do TB on-\nsite and there were no repeat violations. CCI116(1) Discharge Summary was cited in\nthis report and is a repeat violation. The CAP involved sending email reminders to\ncomplete the discharge summary. This CAP was not successful and new policy,\nprocedures and training will need to be developed.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\n08/10/2020\n________________________________________\nDon Collier Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n08/10/2020\n________________________________________\nCourtney Atkins Date\nArea Manager\n6"
