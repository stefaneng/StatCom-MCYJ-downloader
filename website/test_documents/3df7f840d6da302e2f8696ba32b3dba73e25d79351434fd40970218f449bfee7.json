Upon arrival\nto the facility there is a large parking lot where the front entrance to the Macomb\nCounty JJC can be seen. The entrance to the SCYTC is located to the right of the\nentrance to the Macomb facility, facing west. Upon entering the facility there are\nseveral offices and administrative spaces and this eventually leads to a hallway\nthat moves east towards the units. There are two units with ten beds each\nlocated in the south end of the building. Across from these units are two\nclassrooms. Moving further to the west side of the building allows access to a\ngymnasium and an outside recreational space. Moving back east through a\nhallway allows for access to five classroom spaces. Here a commons area and\nlarge cafeteria space is available. A full kitchen is located to the east behind the\n5",
    "cafeteria. Continuing east back toward the front entrance of the building there is a\nmedical wing as well as a boiler room.\nWithin the secure parts of the building are four separate outdoor spaces for the\nuse of recreation of the youth, as well as a gymnasium space inside the building.\nThe section of the building being operated by SCYTC has seven classroom\nspaces to meet the educational needs of youth.\nAn Environmental Health Inspection was approved as of 06/22/2023 resulting in\nan “A” rating. A Fire Safety Inspection was completed on 11/14/2023 and the\nQualified Fire Inspector reported the agency has an “A” rating.

Program Description\nThe Saint Clair Youth Treatment Center (SCYTC) is a secure private child caring\ninstitution intended to provide residential services for juvenile justice youth as they\nwork towards placement back in a community setting. The facility will serve up to\n20 male youth between the ages of 13 and 17. SCYTC will provide Evidence-\nBased Mental Health Programming through a contract with the State of Michigan\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. SCYTC will operate as a secure\nsetting to best ensure the safety of the male youth who have a history of\ndelinquent behaviors, mental health concerns, substance use patterns and needs\nresulting from past trauma. This program is designed to serve youth who have\nnot been successful in less restrictive settings, as well as youth being released\nfrom more restrictive settings working towards community placement.\nAll youth that will be considered for this program will be referred through the\nMDHHS Juvenile Justice Assignment Unit, Care Management Organizations and\nthrough court orders. No private placements will be considered. Youth that will\nnot be considered for placement in the program include medically fragile youth,\ndevelopmentally delayed and cognitively impaired youth, youth that present with a\nneed for in-patient mental health services as well as youth with severe sexually\nmaladaptive and/or reactive behaviors. Youth newly placed to the program will\nreceive an orientation program from a multidisciplinary team within the facility.\nHighly structured days will provide appropriate expectations and predictability for\nyouth. SCYTC will utilize a behavior management curriculum based in social\nlearning theory and cognitive behavioral approaches. The intent of this is to\nreinforce positive behavior for the youth. This behavior management system\nconsists of three separate phases ending with a youth in the highest level that can\nshow leadership skills, receive feedback and work towards self-efficacy.\nSpecifically, within this behavior management programming, restraints have been\napproved for this facility by DCWL. The chosen restraint model is Safe Crisis\nManagement, which is nationally recognized and includes empirical support of\neffectiveness. SCYTC will not use seclusion as a behavior management\n6",
    "intervention. Ratios of staff to youth will be 1:4 during daytime hours and 1:8\nwhile youth are sleeping during nighttime hours. The SCYTC will follow an\nintegrated care model designed to meet each treatment need for a youth.\nNationally recognized and validated assessments will be used in treatment\nplanning. Therapeutic treatment will be provided to youth through a trauma\ninformed and strengths-based approach. They have committed to using\nevidence-based programming such as Aggression Replacement Training, UCCI\nCognitive Behavioral Interventions for substance abuse, Thinking for a Change\nand Seeking Safety groups. These interventions will be provided through\nindividual, group and family therapy services to help work towards the goal of the\nyouth being placed back in the community, a less restrictive setting or in the\nparental home. SCYTC intends to integrate families into programming from the\nbeginning of a placement. Family therapy will utilize a Structural Family therapy\napproach, families will have an assigned case manager for communication and\nfrequent visitation, home passes and daily contact via phone calls will be utilized.\nVarious and regular recreational opportunities for youth will be made available, as\nwell as off-site programming, community service, independent living and life skill\nopportunities. Discharge planning begins upon admission and will continue after\nthe youth is placed elsewhere, offering six months of post-discharge services.\nMedical care for youth placed in this program will be provided by staff within the\nfacility. Medical, dental and behavioral needs will be first identified within 24\nhours of placement and then further health screening will occur within the next 30\ndays. It was confirmed on 11/13/2023 that an agreement was reached for\neducation to be provided on site through a contracted virtual learning service,\nSuccess Virtual Learning Centers of Michigan. SCYTC will have\nparaprofessionals working within the classrooms in coordination with the online\neducational programming and all special education services required of youth will\nbe met.\nC.
