    "(4) Only the least restrictive intervention necessary to prevent\nimmediate harm to the youth or others may be used and must\nfollow an individualized set of graduated interventions that avoid\nthe use of restraints.\nViolation Type Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nAllegation Youth was placed in an unwarranted restraint.\nInvestigation Interviews\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on May 22,\n2023. Complainant did not have further information.\nYouth was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on May\n31, 2023. Youth said she was walking side by side with Staff 1\nand Staff 2 down the Village Road from the Career Technical\nCenter (CTC) to Sherk House and Staff 3 was walking behind\nthem. Youth said she and Staff 1 had their arms hooked\ntogether and she felt they were walking at “a fast pace” and so\nshe slowed down and Staff 3 suddenly “grabbed her arm” and\nput her in a restraint. Youth said she dropped and sat down at\nwhich time Staff 3 placed in her a restraint with her arms behind\nher head and back. Youth said Staff 3 told her to stand up and\nso she did, and he continued to hold her as she was walking\nforward. Youth said Staff 3 was holding tight and she asked him\nto let go, and he refused and so she sat on the ground again.\nYouth said Staff 3 tightened his grip on her arms and said, “oh\nwe are doing this again” and then let her go and walked away.\nYouth said as Staff 3 was walking away he was yelling she was\n“300 pounds and stupid”. Youth said she did not know why she\nwas restrained as she was “just walking”. Youth said after Staff\n3 left, she and Staff 1 and Staff 2 went back to Sherk House.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility, on May\n31, 2023. Staff 1 said on May 12, 2023, Youth was having a\nvery difficult day. Staff 1 said prior to the restraint episode\nYouth had refused school, went into the Mask Center and was\ndisrupting meetings, broke peer’s bicycles, went to the Career\nTechnical Center (CTC) banging on doors, went into Leppien\nbuilding where construction workers were working on\nrenovations and was getting into binders, playing with the copy\nmachine and other computer equipment. Staff 1 said staff were\nable to get Youth back to Sherk house where she seemed to be\nself-regulated for a short time. Staff 1 said Youth’s peer had left\nthe house which was when Youth then decided she was also\ngoing to walk out of Sherk House. Staff 1 said Youth went to the\nCareer Technical Center (CTC) and was getting on top of\nvehicles, breaking antennas off vehicles, and trying to get into\nall of them. Staff 1 said Youth then walked over to a sign that\n2",
    "was laying on the ground and picked it up and was threatening\nstaff. Staff 1 said she, Staff 2 and Staff 3 used proximity control\nand continued to encourage Youth to make good choices. Staff\n1 said Youth was not able to focus on what was being asked of\nher, not able to carry on a conversation, and appeared\ndysregulated. Staff 1 said Youth kept walking to the front the\nCTC and then going back behind where there are maintenance\nvehicles and supplies. Staff 1 said Youth eventually left the\nCTC and began to walk to the Mask Center. Staff 1 said Youth\nwalked to the driveway of the Mask Center and she, Staff 2,\nand Staff 3 continued to use proximity control to ensure her\nsafety. Staff 1 said Youth then agreed to walk back to Sherk\nHouse and began walking down Village Road. Staff 1 said she\nwas using Level 1 position to hold Youth’s arm as they were\nwalking. Staff 1 said she was not using the hold in a restraint\nmanner and there was no restriction of movement. Staff 1 said\nStaff 3 was on the other side of Youth while they were walking.\nStaff 1 said she was unsure of what Staff 3 was doing as she\nwas focused on Youth. Staff 1 said Youth did a “sidestep of\nsome kind” and Staff 3 went into a one-person benevolent hold\nwhich upset Youth and she dropped to the ground. Staff 1 said\nStaff 3 held Youth for about one minute and then released and\nwalked back to his car and she and Staff 2 walked Youth the\nrest of the way back to Sherk House. Staff 1 said Youth was\ntalking and walking in a calm manner and so she was not sure\nwhy Staff 3 placed Youth in a hold.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on June 2, 2023. Staff\n2 said Youth was out of bounds, behind the Career Technical\nCenter (CTC) getting into everything she could find including\nbeing on top of vehicles. Staff 2 said this went on for “a while”\nand Staff 1 was the main staff dealing with Youth and she and\nStaff 3 were there assisting. Staff 2 said eventually Youth\nagreed to walk back to Sherk House and she was on the right\nside of Youth and Staff 1 was on Youth’s left side. Staff 2 said\nshe does not remember Staff 1 having her hands on Youth in\nany way. Staff 2 said Staff 3 was “frustrated that [Youth] was\nnot walking fast enough” and when Youth stopped walking Staff\n3 went into a hold. Staff 2 said Youth sat on the ground and\nStaff 3 continued to hold her. Staff 2 said the hold was “very\nbrief”. Staff 2 said Youth “went off on” Staff 3 and he responded\nby stating “she was lucky she was a resident, or he would spit\non her”. Staff 2 said Youth was not causing harm to self or\nothers when Staff 3 placed her in a restraint.\n3",
    "Staff 3 was called on June 1, 2023, June 2, 2023, and June\n6, 2023. Staff 3’s phone was turned off and he is no longer\nemployed by Eagle Village, therefore, he was unable to be\ninterviewed. Staff 3 did complete a narrative regarding the\nrestraint prior to ending his employment at Eagle Village. The\nnarrative is as follows:\nOn the date of 5/12/2023, the time in question Eagle Village\nstaff member [Staff 3] replied to a radio call for extra staff call\nconcerning a youth who had been out of bounds by the CTC\nbuilding. Upon further investigation, it was learned that youth\nwas [Youth]. [Youth] was walking towards the rear of the CTC\nbuilding by the buses and maintenance trucks, being followed\nby Eagle Village staff member [Staff 1] and [Staff 2]. During her\ntime at the CTC, Youth attempted several unsafe activities,\namong these actions were climbing on top of the maintenance\ntruck, climbing into the busses, and also opening numerous\npanels for various utilities that were outside. Among these\ninterventions were setting limits, proximity control, and calling\nthe On-Call Supervisor for additional support with the situation.\nIn an effort to keep the environment safe staff members\nmaintained proximity control and verbal redirection, after\nseveral minutes of redirection and verbal de-escalation, [Youth]\nagreed to walk back to the house with staff members. At\napproximately 5:30pm, before walking back to the house, [Staff\n3] informed [Youth] she would not be able to walk in the middle\nof the road as it was not safe, and she had already been out of\nbounds in the road earlier that day. [Youth] agreed it was not\nsafe to walk in the road, but still began walking towards the\nroad. [Staff 1] used proximity control to keep [Youth] from\nentering into the roadway, while [Staff 3] continued to inform\n[Youth] she would not able to walk in the road. [Youth]\ncontinued to walk towards the road until [Staff 1] engaged into\nan extended level 1 arm hold. At approximately 5:33pm [Staff 3]\nwent to assist [Staff 1] in the level 1 hold, upon [Staff 3]\ntransition into the restraint [Youth] then tried to sit on the\nground. [Staff 3] immediately transitioned into the Aegis Safety\nPosition as a result of [Youth] dropped her weight. At\napproximately 5:35pm the hold was disengaged once [Youth]\nverbalized a plan to walk back to the house with staff members.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• MiSACWIS Incident Report # 154910209. The incident\nreport is consistent with Staff 1’s interview.\n• Eagle Village Incident Report regarding Youth’s incidents\non May 12, 2023. This incident report outlines all of the\nbehaviors that Youth had throughout the day on May 12,\n4",
    "2023, including the restraint. The incident report has a\nnarrative regarding the restraint written by Staff 1 which\nis consistent with her interview, and a narrative by Staff 3\nwhich is documented above.\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record\nand Staff 1 completed the required Aegis training on\n11/17/2022.\n• Staff 3’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record\nand Staff 3 completed the required Aegis training on\n10/20/2022.\nAnalysis After interviews with youth and staff, it is determined the\nrestraint completed on Youth was not warranted as she was not\ncausing harm to self or other, nor was she in imminent danger.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_____________________________________June 12, 2023_\nStephanie S Meeuwenberg Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 12, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
