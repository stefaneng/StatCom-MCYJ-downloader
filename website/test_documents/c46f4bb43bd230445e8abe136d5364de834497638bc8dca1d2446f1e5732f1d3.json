    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a youth\non any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 4/7/24, Youth A was physically restrained in his room by Staff\n1. The staff punched Youth A in the nose 3 times and put Youth A\nin a choke hold. Youth A had a resulting nosebleed. Youth A did\nnot complain of pain or receive medical care.\nInvestigation This complaint was received on 04/09/2024 and assigned for joint\ninvestigation with MDHHS Specialist.\nInterviews:\nAll the following interviews were conducted at the facility on\n04/09/2024 in collaboration with MDHHS Specialist.\nAdministrator reported there was an incident on 04/07/2024\ninvolving Youth A being restrained due to attacking staff. Youth A\nhad been self-harming earlier in the day, so staff took some items\nout of his room and that’s when Youth A attacked staff.\nAdministrator reported Youth A was restrained in his bedroom and\nthere are no cameras in the bedrooms.\nYouth A has been at the facility for one month. Youth A reported\nhe was restrained a couple of days ago. He was restrained by\nStaff 1 and Staff 2. Youth A said on the day in question he was\nfeeling very anxious, and so he asked to go outside. Youth A was\ntold not to go outside, but he still went outside. Staff 1 came\noutside and told him he had to go back inside. When he came\nback, he found that staff had removed his pencils from his room.\nYouth A became mad and questioned Staff 1 about the items\nremoved from his room. Youth A admitted he pushed Staff 1 and\nthat’s when Staff 1 restrained him. Youth A said he blacked out for\na few minutes and does not remember everything that happened.\n2",
    "Youth A said he has good rapport with Staff 1 and Staff 2 and\ndoes not believe the staff punched him but thinks when Staff 1\nlifted his hand to put him in a restraint his hand hit his nose. Youth\nA admitted he hit and pushed Staff 1 several times when Staff 1\nwas trying to restrain him. Youth A said Staff 2 came in his\nbedroom and assisted Staff 1 with the restraint. Youth A said his\nnose started to bleed and he got a scab on the left side of his neck\nand thinks that was caused by Staff 1’s glove during the restraint.\nYouth A denied he was choked or put in a chokehold during the\nrestraint. Youth A said he didn’t require medical attention, his nose\nstopped bleeding, and he felt fine. Youth A admitted he had self-\nharmed in the past and it had been several weeks since he self-\nharmed. Youth A said he talked to Staff 1 after the restraint, and\nhe apologized to Staff 1. Youth A said he has good rapport with all\nthe staff, and he has never had any issues with Staff 1 or any\nother staff.\nYouth B has been at the facility for 2 months and is on the same\nunit with Youth A. Youth B recalled the incident involving Youth A.\nHe said Youth A was upset because Staff 1 told Youth A it was\nlate, and he could not go outside. Youth B said he didn’t witness\nYouth A being restrained because it happened in Youth A’s\nbedroom. He said Staff 1 and Staff 2 were in the bedroom with\nYouth A. Youth B heard that Youth A got a nosebleed after the\nrestraint. Youth B said it is common for Youth A to get\nnosebleeds, because sometimes when they play basketball Youth\nA’s nose will start to bleed. Youth B reported he feels safe at the\nfacility and has never witnessed staff to choke or push any of the\nyouths.\nYouth C is on the same unit with Youth A. Youth C said he heard\nthat Youth A was restrained but did not witness Youth A being\nrestrained. Youth A said he saw Staff 1 and Staff 2 go into Youth\nA’s bedroom but did not witness Youth A being restrained. Youth\nC has never been restrained. Youth C reported he feels safe at\nthe facility and did not express any concerns regarding the staff.\nTherapist reported Youth A has a history of self-harming and the\nday in question she was informed that Youth A was self-harming\nwith sharp objects. Staff did remove his pencils from his bedroom,\nbecause Youth A was on observation three weeks ago for self-\nharming. She was not working on the day of the restraint, but she\nspoke with Youth A the following day and he reported he was\npunched in the face three times by Staff 1 and got a bloody nose.\nYouth A told her staff did give him paper towel and provided first\naid for his nose.\n3",
    "Administrator reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 have been placed on\nadministrative leave pending the investigations. Administrator said\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 do not have any disciplinary actions and both\nstaff completed CPI refresher course this past February.\nAdministrator reported Youth A’s pencils were removed from his\nroom, because Youth A was anxious, and staff were concerned\nabout him self-harming. Youth A was previously on observation for\nself-harming. Administrator said staff attempted to verbally des-\nescalate Youth A, but he assaulted staff and therefore he was\nrestrained. Administrator said Youth A initially reported he was\npunched in the face by Staff 1 but has changed his story multiple\ntimes about what happened. Staff 1 provided Youth A with first\naid for the nosebleed and asked if he needed medical care and\nYouth A refused. Administrator is not aware of Youth A having a\nnosebleed prior to this incident.\nI interviewed Staff 1 via telephone, in collaboration with MDHHS\nSpecialist who was present at the facility. Staff reported on\n04/07/2024 Youth A went outside without permission, so he went\noutside and got Youth A to go back to the unit. Youth A went to his\nroom and found that his pencils were removed from his room.\nYouth A became mad, Staff 1 tried to talk to Youth A and calm him\ndown, but Youth A became more escalated, so Staff 1 and Staff 2\nattempted to put Youth A in a standing restraint. Youth A started\nhitting, pushing, and head butted them, so they released the hold\non Youth A. He and Staff 2 tried to talk to Youth A, but he\ncontinued to be aggressive, so they again attempted a 2nd\nrestraint and for approximately 30 seconds. Youth A did calm\ndown, and they released the hold. Staff 1 said he did notice Youth\nA's nose was bleeding and he provided him with first aid. He\nasked Youth A multiple times if he needed anything, and Youth A\nsaid he was fine. Staff 1 said Youth A apologized and admitted\nthat he was wrong for pushing and punching Staff 1. He asked\nYouth A to write a statement about the incident and that’s when\nYouth A changed his story and said that he was hit and choked.\nStaff 1 denied choking or punching Youth A. Staff 1 said he did\nnot observe any bruises or injuries on Youth A and Youth A\nrefused medical attention. Staff 1 said he has a good rapport with\nYouth A and that he is usually able to get Youth A to calm down\nverbally, but he is not sure what was going on with Youth A that\nevening. This was the first time Staff 1 had to restrain Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via telephone, in collaboration with MDHHS\nSpecialist who was in person at the facility. Staff 2 reported on\n04/07/2024 Youth A had left the unit without permission, so Staff 1\n4",
    "followed Youth A and got him to return to the unit. Youth A went to\nhis bedroom and Staff 1 followed Youth A. Youth A became more\nescalated when he found out that some items were removed from\nhis bedroom, so Staff 1 attempted to verbally deescalate Youth A.\nYouth A became more aggressive, so Staff 2 went to assist Staff\n1. Staff 2 said Youth A pushed and hit Staff 1 in the chest, so she\nand Staff 1 attempted to put Youth A in a team control restraint.\nShe and Staff 1 struggled to hold Youth A and that’s when the\nbedroom door closed. Youth A continued to struggle during the\nrestraint, so they released the hold. Youth A continued to be\nescalated and aggressive, they attempted a second team control\nhold for less than one minute and released the hold once Youth A\ncalmed down. She and Staff 1 debriefed with Youth A after the\nincident and Youth A was asked why he attacked Staff 1 and\nYouth A said he “blacked out” and does not know why he lashed\nout on Staff 1. She denied Staff 1 punched or put Youth A in a\nchokehold. Staff 1 said Youth A was offered first aid for the\nnosebleed. Staff 1 did not observe any marks or bruises on Youth\nA from being restrained.\nA predisposition conference was held with MDHHS Specialist on\n05/07//2024. There is no finding by MDHHS Specialist.\nTour Observation:\nA tour of the facility occurred on 04/09/2024. The living room was\nobserved, which leads to Youth A’s bedroom where Youth A was\nrestrained. When standing in the living room the inside of Youth\nA’s bedroom is visible.\nVideo Reviewed:\nThe video footage date is 04/07/2024 at approximately 8 pm.\n(video has no audio) Staff 1 is standing in the doorway of Youth\nA’s bedroom and Staff 2 is also observed standing outside the\nbedroom. Youth A is seen pushing Staff 1. Staff 1 and Staff 2\nenter the bedroom, and the bedroom door is closed.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 04/07/2024 at approximately 7:50 pm,\nwritten by Staff 2. Incident type is aggressive behavior.\nIncident report is consistent with Staff 2’s interview.\n• Behavior Management Policy and Procedures states,\nPhysical behavior management intervention is used only\nwhen it is assessed a youth is at risk of imminent harm to\nthemselves or others. The CPI Crisis Development Model\ndocuments that staff learning appropriate and effective\napproaches to crisis behaviors presented by youth. Staff's\nresponses are outlined and range from de-escalation to\n5",
    "physical restraint, physical management is the last option\nafter staff have exhausted all other efforts to de-escalate\nthe youth and they remain a danger to themselves or\nothers. Report of the restraint must be completed within 12\nhours.\n• Personnel files for Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 1 and Staff 2\ncompleted nonviolent crisis intervention training on\n02/29/2024. Staff 1 and Staff 2 do not have any disciplinary\nreports.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence that Youth A was put in a choke hold and/or punched.\nYouth A initially reported he was punched and choked during the\nrestraint, but when interviewed he denied being punched in the\nface or choked. Youth A admitted to being aggressive and hitting\nand punching staff. Inconsistent with what was initially reported,\nthe staff stated Youth A hit, punched and head butted them, and\nthus, was physically restrained. Youth A’s nose bled briefly\nafterward. However, it could not be determined what caused his\nnose to bleed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\nJune 7, 2024\n____________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 11, 2024\n____________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n6"
