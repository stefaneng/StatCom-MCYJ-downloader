    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code License recommendation\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12325\nSection • (1) An agency shall recommend to the department the\nDescription appropriate licensing action consistent with facts contained\nin the foster home evaluation and any special evaluations.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation It is alleged that the agency failed to make the appropriate\nlicensing recommendation based upon findings of special\nevaluations.\nInvestigation The Licensing Supervisor was interviewed via telephone on\n08/12/24. The Licensing Supervisor confirmed the agency had\nconducted three investigations on the home of Foster Parents A\nand B in 2023. The Licensing Supervisor reported the agency\nrecommended revocation of the foster home license at conclusion\nof the third investigation. The Licensing Supervisor was asked\nwhy the agency had not recommended revocation of the license\nupon conclusion of the first and/or second investigation, each of\nwhich the agency investigations had concluded that physical\nabuse of a child had occurred in the home. The Licensing\nSupervisor reported upon conclusion of the first investigation a\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Worker\ninvolved in the case had recommended a corrective action plan\nand supportive services to Foster Parents A and B. A safety plan\nwas also initiated.\nThe Licensing Supervisor reported upon conclusion of the second\ninvestigation that Families First interventions were initiated for\nFoster Parents A and B. The Supervisor also reported the second\ninvestigation involved a different caregiver, in this case Foster\nParent B. The Licensing Supervisor reported the first investigation\ninvolved Foster Parent A. The Licensing Supervisor reported since\neach investigation involved different caregivers and children, they\nwere separate incidents of physical abuse and a recommendation\nof revocation was not warranted. The Licensing Supervisor\nreported the agency was looking for a pattern of abuse and the\ndifferent caregivers involved was not establishing a pattern. The\nLicensing Supervisor reported the third investigation established a\npattern of physical abuse in the home and the agency therefore\nrecommended revocation of the license.\n2",
    "The Director of Children’s Services, hereafter referred to as\nDirector, was interviewed via telephone on 07/02/24 and\n08/12/24. The Director reported the agency was following\nrecommended procedures contained in Communication Issuance\n23-036 Updated, which recommends in part, that disciplinary\naction or a corrective action plan is recommended when another\nDHHS Worker has findings in a foster home.\nThe Director also reported that each of the first two investigations\ninvolved different caretakers in the home and therefore there was\nnot an established pattern of abuse.\nStaff 1, the agency Licensing Worker, was interviewed via\ntelephone on 08/13/24. Staff 1 reported that revocation of the\nfoster home license was not recommended upon conclusion of the\nsecond investigation as a pattern was not established as the\nphysical abuse was committed by different caregivers. Staff 1\nreported services were provided to the family as well as a\ncorrective action plan. Staff 1 reported the third incident of\nphysical abuse warranted a recommendation of revocation of the\nlicense as the agency felt the third incident established a pattern\nof abuse.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW:\n• Special Evaluation #2023C0000507, initiated on 04/07/23,\nestablished a violation of R 400.9201 as Foster Parent A\nwas found to have dragged a child as well as tapping\nchildren on their heads and spraying children with water.\n• Special Evaluation #2023C0000626, initiated on 05/15/23,\nestablished a violation of R 400.9201 as Foster Parent B\nhad grabbed a child by the arm lifting the child off the\nground causing bruising.\n• Communication Issuance (CI) 23-036 Updated was\nreviewed. The CI states in part that if a confirmation by\nDHHS Worker involves a licensed foster home the\nLicensing Supervisor and licensing worker must implement\ndisciplinary action or a corrective action plan.\n• FTM and included safety plan dated 04/25/23 was\nreviewed. The safety plan involved additional training for\nthe foster parents as well as the foster parents increasing\nself-awareness when feeling frustrated and removing\nthemselves from situations before their behavior escalates.\n• The DHHS investigation reports were reviewed. Reports\nwere consistent with the special evaluations. All reports had\n3",
    "findings by the DHHS Worker’s as well as the agency’s\nspecial evaluations.\nAnalysis The agency was found in non-compliance as two special\nevaluations of the foster home established physical abuse\noccurring in the home.\nThe Director of Children’s Services, Licensing Supervisor, and\nStaff 1 had concluded that disciplinary action against the foster\nhome was not warranted after conclusion of the second special\nevaluation as different caretakers were involved and a pattern was\nnot therefore established.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued\nAugust 19, 2024\n______________________________________\nDouglas W Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 30, 2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
