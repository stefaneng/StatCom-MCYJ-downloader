    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nSummary of Allegations: Staff 1 may harm someone.\nViolation\nEstablished\nCOF Rule 400.10169: Discipline (1) No\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nContact Date Contact Type Contact Method Contact\nPurpose\n1/12/2023 10:24 AM DCWL Contact Face to Face Announced\nVisit\n1/12/2023 10:26 AM Child Caring Face to Face Exit\nInstitution Contact Conference\n1/5/2023 1:18 PM Child Caring Phone Other\nInstitution Contact\n1/5/2023 1:19 PM DCWL Contact Phone Other\nINVESTIGATION:\nRule Code & COF Rule 400.10169\nSection (1) A facility shall have and follow written policy and procedure which\nDescription stipulates that residents shall not be subject to any of the following:\n(a) corporal or cruel punishment\n(b) humiliation\n(c) mental abuse\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation In 2019, staff member broke a foster child's arm during a restraint. The\nchild was moved out of the unit and staff was placed on a leave of\nabsence. As of today, staff is employed at the facility and there are\nconcerns that staff will harm another juvenile.\nInvestigation It is to be noted that the actual perpetrator on the allegations was\ninaccurately noted in the allegations. It was confirmed through\nComplainant 1 who the actual alleged perpetrator should be in the\nallegations.\n2",
    "On 1/5/23, I spoke to Complainant 1 via telephone. Complainant 1\nreported that he did not know of anyone that was being hurt by Staff 1\ncurrently. Complainant 1 was just concerned Staff 1 may harm\nsomeone due to being involved in an investigation in 2019.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 on 1/5/23 via telephone and face to face\non 1/12/23. Administrator 1 reported that Staff 1 is on third shift and\ndoes not interact with the youth as he once did. Administrator 1 did\nreport there have been issues with Staff 1 and they are documented in\nhis disciplinary files. Administrator 1 reported that there have been no\ncomplaints that Staff 1 has hurt children or is currently harming\nchildren, nor any grievances.\nI reviewed DCWL Investigation 2019C0420020 and the Corrective\nAction Plan. Pertaining to Staff 1, the agency was found in non-\ncompliance of R. 400.4112, R 400.4159, and R 400.4158 2(a) (c). Staff\n1 pulled a youth from the bench instead of using proper de-escalation\ntechniques. Staff 1 was placed on the CPS abuse/neglect registry. Due\nto this placement, he was suspended on March 28, 2019, while\ncompleting an appeal for the registry. If Staff 1 is removed from the\nregistry, and the facility would like to maintain Staff 1 as an employee\nthen Staff 1 would have to complete \"restraint procedures for De-\nescalation, escort, and restraint training with an emphasis on how to\nmove residents when they are refusing to let go of a stationary object.\"\nI reviewed CPS clearances for Staff 1 since 2019 to present date. Staff\n1 is not on the CPS registry.\nI reviewed Staff 1's training and all training was completed for the\ncorrective action plan as well as up to date.\nI reviewed Staff 1's overall disciplinary record.\n2/19/19: 30-day+ Suspension due to investigation 2019C0420020\n9/20/20: 14-day suspension for using a cell phone while managing the\ngroup.\n11/17/20: 30-day suspension not following Covid precautions.\n6/6/22: Settlement agreement for excessive horseplay.\n8/9/22: Reviewed, two youth able to be together against behavior\nmanagement plan.\n9/15/22: Ongoing review for being disruptive in school classroom.\n10/19/22: Notice given to move to 3rd shift in accordance with union\ncontract.\nI reviewed Staff 1's Performance Evaluation dated 9/1/22. Staff will\nreceive a 6-month work performance on 6/1/23 instead of a yearly one\n4",
    "to determine performance. The following goals were noted on his\nevaluation:\n1) Keep a clean record on write ups until 6/1/23\n2) Take initiative to work with new staff on the wing\n3) Improvement in management of group\n4) Work on fundamental skill on computer\nI interviewed Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C face to face at the facility\non 1/12/23. All three-youth reported they knew Staff 1 and have never\nseen or heard anyone state they have been harmed by Staff 1. All\nthree-youth reported they feel safe with Staff 1.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to conclude that Staff 1 is actively harming youth\nin the facility. The agency has trained Staff 1 and disciplined him\naccording to their policies and have up to date evaluations in place\nmonitoring his staffing ability. They have moved him to a position where\nthe agency feels Staff 1 is better suited and has not been reprimanded\nsince that time.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n1/18/23\n_____________________________________\nVenus Decker Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n____________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
