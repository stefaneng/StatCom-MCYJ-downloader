When they\nwere inside, Youth A began pounding on the back door and asked\nto come in. Staff 2 opened the door and entered the facility with\nYouth A and Youth C.

Staff 1 reported she gave Youth B her medications\nand asked if Youth B wanted time in her bedroom to de-escalate\nherself, which Youth B refused. Staff 1 reported Youth B chose to\nsit on the couch to de-escalate instead. Staff 1 reported she saw\nYouth A, Youth C and Staff 2 entering the fence gate into the back\nyard. Staff 1 reported she saw a pair of safety scissors on the\ntable and put those in her pocket in case things escalated. She\nasked Youth B to go to her bedroom, but Youth B still refused and\nstated she wanted to remain on the couch. Staff 2, Youth A and\nYouth C entered the facility and Youth A immediately asked Staff\n1 for the scissors. Staff 1 reported when she refused, Youth A\nasked for an explanation and Staff 1 told her she could not have\nany sharp objects if she was escalated.

Staff 1 reported she and Staff 2 were trying\nto use an approved release technique to release Youth A’s hands\nfrom Youth B’s neck. They all ended up falling to the floor and\nYouth C helped Youth B off the floor and away from Youth A. After\nYouth B was out of the way, Staff 1 instructed Staff 2 to take\nYouth B and Youth C out the front door and to the gym so they\nwere safe. Staff 1 reported she used body positioning techniques\nto keep Youth A from attacking Youth B, Youth C and Staff 2.\nAfter Youth B, Youth C and Staff 2 exited the building, Staff 1\npositioned herself in between Youth A and the front door so Youth\nA couldn’t get out the front door. Youth A shoved Staff 1 into the\ndoor a few times. Staff 1 reported Youth A was yelling she was not\nthe one who started this situation and Staff 1 was still trying to\nverbally deescalate her. Youth A then went out the back door,\nwent into the backyard and exited the gate to go to the front of the\nhome. Staff 1 reported Youth A threw dirt at Staff 1’s car and then\ntook the salt bucket and threw it at her car.

After a few minutes, Youth B got up and\nwalked towards the facility and Youth A told her she “didn’t have\nto be a baby” and “to stop acting like that”. Youth B was still upset\nand cursed at Youth A. Youth A then went on a walk with Staff 1\n5",
    "to take a break. Staff 2 stated Youth A threw her shoes and said,\n“fuck this bitch; I’m going to kill her”, lifted the latch to the gate and\nexited the backyard to walk around the property. Staff 2 reported\nhe and Youth C walked after her. Staff 2 reported he was trying to\ndeescalate her while they walked around the property, but it was\nnot working. Staff 2 reported when Youth A could not find Youth B,\nshe went back into the backyard and began banging on the back\ndoor of the house. Staff 2 reported he, Youth A and Youth C all\nwent into the house and Youth B was sitting on the couch while\nStaff 1 was close by. Staff 2 reported Youth A and Youth B began\nhaving a verbal exchange and were cursing at each other.

Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was standing in between\nYouth A and the front door to block her from following them. Staff\n2 reported during the altercation, Staff 1 was able to call the\npolice, who arrived shortly after Staff 2, Youth B and Youth C\nmade it to the gym. Staff 2 reported he and Staff 1 did everything\nthey could to protect the kids without violating their restraint\npolicies and procedures. Staff 2 reported Youth A would not\nrespond to any of their instructions, prompts or de-escalation\nefforts. Staff 2 reported they always try to separate youth into their\nrooms if things are becoming escalated, but Youth B refused to go\nto her room.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n5/24/23 in conjunction with MDHHS Worker. Supervisor\nreported the facility utilizes Mandt for restraints. There are no\napproved Mandt restraint methods where staff can restrain a\nyouth on the floor or while sitting on the couch. Staff are not\nallowed to push, pick-up, grab or pull a youth. Staff are allowed to\nbody block and conduct releases. The restraints they can do\ninclude a side body hug, a two-person side body hug and a one-\narm restraint, but all of those need to be conducted when a youth\nis in a standing position.\nSupervisor, Administrator 1, and Administrator 2 were\ninterviewed face to face at the facility on 6/27/23 to review\nvideo footage and the Mandt System Handbook. At\n6",
    "approximately 0:52 into the video, Youth A backed up from Youth\nB. Staff 1 and Staff 2 were on either side of Youth B. Supervisor\nreported Staff 1 and Staff 2 have been trained in Mandt. According\nto Mandt, if the aggressive party voluntarily disengages from the\nharmful behavior, no restraint should occur. In this situation, Youth\nA voluntarily backed up and there was not an indication Youth A\nwas going to attack or be aggressive towards Youth B again.\nUpon Youth A becoming aggressive again, Staff 1 and Staff 2\nimmediately began body blocking and positioning themselves to\nprotect Youth B. At the point Youth A reattacked, Staff 1 and Staff\n2 could not restrain Youth A due to her positioning on the couch\nas the restraints can only be done when a person is in a standing\nposition. At approximately 1:19 into the video, Youth A was\nseparated from Youth B, but Staff 1 and Staff 2 did not restrain\nYouth A. Administrator 1 stated Mandt training teaches restraints\ncan only be utilized for imminent danger. Administrator 1 reported\nsince there was space between Youth A and Youth B and Youth A\nwas no longer attacking Youth B, there would have been no\nreason to restrain Youth A. Administrator 1 noted after the youth\nand staff fell off the couch and got up, Youth A never physically\ntouched Youth B again due to Staff 1 and Staff 2’s body\npositioning efforts. Supervisor also noted Mandt teaches before a\nrestraint can be utilized, attempts must be made to remove the\nstimulus. In this situation, the stimulus for Youth A was Youth B\nand Staff 1 and Staff 2 made efforts and succeeded in removing\nYouth B from the building.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from 5/15/23 was reviewed (Note: there is no\naudio). Youth B is viewed to be sitting on the couch in Gail’s\nHouse while Staff 1 walks around the living room area close by.\nTo the left side of the camera angle, you can see someone\napproach the backdoor leading from the backyard into the facility.\nStaff 1 walks over, approaches the table by the back door, grabs\nan object off the table and puts it in her pocket. Youth A enters the\nfacility through the back door and is facing Staff 1 while they have\na conversation. Staff 2 walks around the table to the left of Youth\nA and stands closer to Staff 1. Youth C is seen to be on the other\nside of the table to the right of Youth A. Youth B remains seated\non the couch. Youth A and Staff 1 continue talking. Then Youth A\nturns her body and faces towards Youth B sitting on the couch\nand they exchange words. Staff 1 moves over so she is in\nbetween Youth B and Youth A and begins backing up towards\nYouth B. Staff 2 moves over and positions himself closer to Youth\nA so he is in between Youth A and Youth B. Youth A then pushes\nStaff 2 out of the way a couple times and charges towards Youth\n7",
    "B. Staff 1 positions herself right in between Youth A and Youth B,\nwhile Staff 2 follows behind Youth A. Youth A pushes Staff 1 to\nthe right, goes over Staff 1’s left shoulder and begins punching\nYouth B. Youth C begins to approach the situation. Staff 2 comes\naround the back of Youth A, places his hands on Youth A’s back\nand moves to her right side. Youth A then backs up and Staff 1\nand Staff 2 try to position themselves in between Youth A and\nYouth B. Staff 1 body blocks Youth A’s advances towards Youth B\nand Youth A backs up again. Staff 2 then positions himself in\nbetween Staff 1 and Youth A. Youth C walks over to the couch\nnear Youth B. Youth A walks to the right and then back to the left\nwhile Staff 1 and Staff 2 are following along positioned in between\nYouth A and Youth B. Youth A then shoves Staff 1 and Staff 2 out\nof the way, sits on the couch and begins attacking Youth A. Youth\nC is trying to get Youth A off of Youth B while Staff 2 is trying to\nposition himself in between Youth A and Youth B. Staff 1 pulls her\nphone out of her pocket and is seen calling someone. Youth C\nuses her body to try and shove Youth A off of Youth B and Staff 2\nis continuing to try and get in a better position to separate Youth A\nand Youth B. Youth C is seen pulling Youth B off the couch while\nYouth A is still on top of her. Youth A falls off the couch to a\nkneeling position, which pushes Staff 2 and Staff 1 over. Youth A\nstill has her hands on Youth B, so while Youth C continues to pull\nYouth B away, it causes Youth A to fall on the ground, which then\ncauses Staff 2 to also fall on the ground. Youth C helps Youth B\noff the ground. Youth A and Staff 2 both stand up. Staff 1 positions\nherself in between Youth A and the other two youth while she is\nstill seen on the phone. Youth B and Youth C run towards the front\ndoor. Youth A changes direction to go around the other side of the\ncouch since Staff 1 is blocking one side. Staff 1 and Staff 2 jog\naround to get in between Youth A and the other two youth. The\npillar in the living room blocks the view of the front door so it is\ndifficult to see. At one point, you can see Staff 2 body blocking\nYouth A from getting to the other two youth and Staff 1 says\nsomething to Youth A while pointing in the opposite direction.\nYouth A backs up and is seen taking her socks off while Staff 1 is\nstanding in front of the other two youth in the corner by the front\ndoor. The front door opens and Youth B and Youth C run towards\nthe open door while Youth A charges at the door. Staff 1 positions\nherself to block Youth A. You can see Staff 2’s shirt on the other\nside of the front door and it is clear he also exited the building.\nYouth A then throws something towards the front door, walks\ntowards the back door, and exits the back door.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n8",
    "• Family & Children Services (F&CS) Emergency Restraint in\na Child Caring Institution Procedure (effective 5/31/22)\noutlines the definitions and situations in which emergency\nrestraint may be utilized. It states staff may not utilize any\nphysical intervention techniques except for what they are\ntrained in by the Mandt System.\n• Family & Children Services (F&CS) Behavior Support &\nManagement Policy (rev. 9/29/22) outlines the agency’s\nphilosophy of behavior support and management, with a\nfocus on positive behavior support. It also outlines\nunapproved methods of behavior management, which\nincludes no hitting, striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing any part of an individual’s body.\n• The Mandt System Inc. Student Workbook 1975-2017\nstates the intention of Mandt is not to fight power with\npower. “The Mandt System believes that some physical\ninteraction skills may be used to assist or limit a person’s\nbehavior”. Chapter 9 teaches “Restraining means limiting,\nbut not immobilizing a person who has engaged in behavior\nthat is harmful to themselves and/or others”. “After the\npeople who were at risk are safe, the interaction should be\ndiscontinued in a planned, purposeful approach”.\no Restraints that can be used in Mandt:\n▪ One person, one arm standing restraint:\nClient must be standing. One person must be\nbehind the client with arms around the client\nholding one of the client’s arms close to their\nbody.\n▪ One- or two-person side body hug: Client\nmust be standing. Client’s arms are held\nagainst their body, while one or two people\nare on either side of the client. The staff put\none of their legs in front of the client and each\nhug the client from the side, holding down the\narm on the opposite side of their body.\n• MiSACWIS Incident Report #154620204 dated 5/16/23\ndetailed the events from 5/15/23 and was consistent with\nStaff 1’s interview.\n• KDPS Police Report (Case Number: 23-006753) dated\n5/25/23 outlines the police contact with all parties on\n5/15/23. Report notes Youth A was arrested for Felonious\nAssault (Assault by Strangulation), Assault and Battery\n9",
    "(Simple Assault) and Malicious Destruction of\nProperty>$1000. Report notes Youth A admitted to Law\nEnforcement she punched Youth B in the face, strangled\nher and damaged Staff 1’s vehicle.\n• Email from MDHHS Worker detailing her interview with\nYouth A conducted on 5/17/23. Initially Youth A refused to\nmeet with MDHHS Worker, cursed at MDHHS Worker and\nshut the door in MDHHS Worker’s face. When MDHHS\nWorker was leaving the facility, Youth A agreed to meet\nbriefly. MDHHS Worker noted Youth A was short and\nabrupt in her responses. Youth A noted staff cannot\nrestrain anyone at the facility, so they stand close, tell the\nyouth to stop and try to get in between them to stop things.\nYouth A reported on 5/15/23, everyone was having fun, but\nthen Youth B got serious, told her to “Get the fuck out of my\nbusiness” and there was a physical altercation. Youth A\nstated “I choked her. Police came, because when there is a\nfight here, they normally call police. Staff was right there”.\nYouth A stated the police took a photo of her, took her\nfingerprints, and took her to the hospital. Youth A reported\nshe did not have any injuries. Youth A abruptly indicated\nshe was done talking, got up and walked away.\n• Staff 1 does not have any discipline in her personnel file.\nShe completed Mandt training on 3/8/23.\n• Staff 2 does not have any discipline in his personnel file. He\ncompleted Mandt training on 10/31/22.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and video footage reviewed, no\nviolation is found. The staff proactive in their approaches to keep\nall youth safe. When things began to escalate, the staff reacted\nappropriately, even when Youth A began escalating further.\nTechnical Assistance\n• If another youth becomes involved in a situation to help\nprotect another youth, staff need to instruct youth to back\naway and not get involved for their own safety.\n• Staff are trained to perform physical restraints in Mandt.\nEven if a youth is not in a perfect position to conduct the\nrestraint, staff need to assist the youth in getting into a\nbetter position so the restraint can be conducted; if\nwarranted.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n10",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJune 15, 2023\nShannon Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 30, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
