    "PREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator(CA) identified the two special investigation 2023C0000037\nand 2023C0000107 as occurring. She reported the steps taken which involve,\nadditional hours of training, role-playing, and case scenarios were added to the\ntraining to help ensure staff fully understand the concepts and unscheduled\noversight visits from administration staff to ensure staff are following new training\nand policies. New hires receive a 4-week training on the six core strategies. Weekly\n“round up” meetings led by the case managers to ensure staff fully understand the\ntreatment being provided to each youth. Progress has been measured by the 100%\nreduction in incidents at the facility. The development of an updated program\nstatement has helped the facility process new referrals to ensure the appropriate\nyouth are being placed at the facility. This has allowed the facility to gather more\nbackground information about each referral. All staff have been trained on the\nmandating reporter requirements and compliance is being checked by staff signing\nthey attended the training and understand the reporting process. The facility has\ndeveloped a role-modeling training scenario to help staff understand their\nappropriate responses to violent situations. The round up meeting allow all staff to\nunderstand the youth’s individual treatment plans to better responded in an\nappropriate manner. They are measuring compliance by the reduction in afterhours\ncalls and the significant reduction in incident reports. The facility has updated their\nhiring process to include more in-depth hiring questions which help the facility\nunderstand the possible new hires response to stress and situations that could be\ncommon on the facility. The CA has identified no barriers to compliance since they\nhave started the new actions steps of the two CAPs. The CA also identified there\nwere no unplanned discharges during this reporting period. However, this\nassessment was written prior to the one unplanned discharge they had between\nthis assessment and the interim inspection. This unplanned discharge was the\nresult of a youth being arrested and placed in the local juvenile home. The youth\nhas since been replaced to a detention facility.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews with staff were conducted and all staff report the new training and CAP\naction steps are very positive and helpful. They believe these changes have helped\nenhance their ability to provide appropriate care for the youth. Administrative staff\ninterviewed displayed a strong desire to provide the best practice for the youth in\nthe program and to support the staff providing the direct care.\nInterviews with three of the four youth in the program were conducted. Although\nlimited verbal skills, two of the three youth were verbal and reported feeling safe at\nthe facility. The interactions observed between youth and staff were appropriate\nand the staff were very attentive to the needs of the youth. The fourth youth was\nattending an ABA therapy session during this time.\n4",
