    "07/26/2021 Contact – Face to face\nPre-exit\nALLEGATION:\nThere have been at least three instances where the agency is not providing required\nreunification services to families nor are they assisting with implementing services\nafter they have been requested and court ordered.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 6/4/21 a complaint was received which alleged that there were several issues\nwith case management on all the cases that Samaritas currently holds through\nIngham County.\n• With Case A the agency failed to provide services to the family for\nreunification. The court ordered the agency to start overnights and return the\nchild with in-home services. The agency failed to follow the court instructions\nand the court ordered the case back to DHHS.\n• For Case B the relative caregiver reported to the Referral Source (RS) that\nshe is concerned because there are no services in place for the parents or\nthe child. She has been asking the agency to assist her with getting mental\nhealth services for the child they have not assisted. She is concerned about\nthe child going home because the agency has not put services for the parents\nin place.\n• For Case C there was a Family Team Meeting (FTM) held on 06/02/2021 to\ndiscuss possible unsupervised parenting time. During the meeting the\nSupervisor who is acting as the worker for the case had to ask the parents\nwhat services they have and have not completed. It was obvious that the\nagency has failed to put any services in place.\nMiSACWIS and hard copy file reviews:\nCase A:\n Samaritas received the case in January of 2020\n Staff 1 was the worker on the case from 8/31/20 – 4/22/21\n Staff 2 took over on 4/22/21 until the case was returned to DHHS on 5/1/21\n All 3 reports reviewed stated under barriers that father was not visiting with\nYouth A, he was not communicating with the agency. The contacts in all\nthree reports indicate dad was participating in parenting time that was\nsupervised by Staff 1.\n Two of the three reports did not have Parent Agency Treatment Plans\n(PATP) that would list the services the family required and the services they\nwere receiving.\n3",
    " The 5/10/21 report indicated mom was attending Youth A’s medical\nappointments, but those appointments were not listed in the contacts.\n The reports indicated Youth A was receiving therapy services, mom was\nreceiving parenting classes and mental health services.\n There were not any contacts listed between Staff 1 and the birth parents.\n The only contact to a service provided that was listed was on 12/9/20.\n The MiSACWIS record did not have any service documents uploaded.\n The hard copy file for Case A did not have any service documents in them.\n There lacked any documentation in the hard file that Staff 1 had\ncommunication with the birth parents.\nCase B:\n Samaritas assigned the case on 2/12/21.\n Staff 1 was assigned the case from 2/12/21 to 4/21/21.\n Staff 2 is the current Foster Care Worker (FCW) assigned to the case.\n There were minimal contacts completed by Staff 1 for the first month of the\ncase. There were no contacts between Staff 1 and the birth parents or service\nproviders.\n At the time of the initial review there were not any PATP’s completed for this\ncase. The current worker completed those PATP’s after he was interviewed\nfor this investigation.\n The hard copy file for Case B did not have any service documents in them.\n There lacked any documentation in the hard file that Staff 1 had\ncommunication with the birth parents.\nCase C:\n Samaritas was assigned this case on 12/6/19.\n Staff 1 was assigned this case from 9/31/20 to 4/21/21.\n As of 4/21/21 Staff 3, is the current worker on the case.\n The PATP for the Updated Service Plan completed on 11/18/20 did not have\nany parent signatures indicating they were involved in the creation of the plan.\nThe plan did indicate services the parents were participating in.\n The Service Plan completed on 2/16/21 did not have a PATP.\n There were not any contacts documented between Staff 1 and the birth\nparents or service providers.\n There were documents in the hard file indicating the parents received mental\nhealth services.\n There lacked any documentation in the hard file that Staff 1 had\ncommunication with the birth parents.\nA case not included in the complaint was also viewed.\nCase D:\n The case was assigned on 7/17/20.\n Staff 1 had the case from 11/16/20 to 4/21/21.\n4",
    " Staff 3 is the current worker as of 4/22/21.\n The birth mother was not participating in services.\n Many contacts were documented indicating Staff 1 tried to reach the mother.\nStaff 2 Interview: Staff 2 was interviewed via video conferencing on 6/16/21. He\nstated he is a Foster Care Worker. He started in February of 2020. He is the worker\nfor Case B. He has been on the case for a month. He received the case from Staff 1.\nStaff 1 did not complete an Initial Service Plan (ISP), so he had to complete one in\norder to do the Updated Service Plan (USP) that was due. Staff 1 did not note what\nservices the parents were engaged in. When Staff 2 received the case, dad was\nsupposed to be participating in drug testing, but dad did not go until Staff 2 received\nthe case in May. The parents are now participating in parenting classes, coach work,\nsubstance abuse evaluation and psychological testing. The parents need to do all\nthe leg work to get their services set up on their own and then Staff 2 will check with\nthe service providers and the parents to verify progress. He checks with service\nproviders bi-weekly and the parents three times a week. He checks the substance\nabuse screens daily. He supervises parenting time and meets with the parents at\nthat time. He was informed of a court hearing that was to occur on 5/19/21 and had\nthree to four days to complete the court reports. The court and DHHS were not\nhappy with the report, so court was adjourned until 5/27/21. The court received the\nupdated court report the day prior to the hearing on the 27th so court was again\nadjourned until 6/4/21 when the hearing was completed.\nStaff 3 Interview: Staff 3 was interviewed at the agency on 6/18/21. Staff 3 stated\nhe was Staff 1's supervisor and currently supervises Staff 2. He was aware Staff 1\nwas getting behind on her job duties after a baby on her caseload passed away.\nThen Staff 1 gave her 30-day notice as she had found another job. He went through\nall her cases after she left and saw that things were not completed. She entered\nphysicals that were not completed and uploading other documents, which caused\nthe Book of Business (BOB) to not show accurate information. Staff 3 contracted\nCOVID in April of 2021 and things got worse during that time. Staff 1 did not\ncomplete her home visits in April. She was consistent with parenting time. Tons of\ncase notes were not entered. Referrals to services were not followed up on. Staff 1\nwas supposed to make the referral then ensure the parents were going and report to\nthe court how they were doing. Staff 1 was not meeting with birth parents, not\ncompleting contacts, and not putting medicals into MiSACWIS. Case A was sent\nback to DHHS because his agency tried to set up supervised visits with the parents,\nbut they could not get a hold of them, so the visits were not set up. He was aware of\nthe services being completed but he wanted to know the progress being done on\nthem. Staff 1's notes were vague. Staff 3 would ask Staff 1 if she followed up on\nsomething. She would say she did, but he would find out that she had not. He met\nwith Staff 1 two times a month, but they talked on the phone every day.\nStaff 4 Interview: Staff 4 was interviewed via video conferencing on 6/18/21. He\nstated he is the Foster Care Program Manager, and he supervises Staff 3. He did\nnot become aware of the issues with Staff 1’s cases until she left the agency. He\n5",
    "was aware that Staff 1 struggled with the death of an infant on her caseload. He met\nwith her and offered grief and loss counseling. They determined that she was not a\ngood fit for the position she was in. She was passive and did not address things with\nbirth parents. The birth parents took advantage of her. When Staff 3 took over her\ncases he had trouble finding information. DHHS reached out to Staff 4 and asked\nhim to look at her cases. He met with DHHS and the Lansing team in person and the\nmeeting did not go well so he ended it. He then met separately with DHHS then with\nhis staff to convey their concerns. He took over managing the Lansing office. He has\nsince returned it back to Staff 3. Staff 3 was placed on a performance improvement\nplan. When Staff 1 left she did not give Staff 3 all the information for her cases.\nThere was a gap in communication between Staff 1 and Staff 3. There needs to be a\ncase conference when staff leave. The cases Staff 1 were difficult cases. Staff 4 is\nstill working with the Lansing team and coaching them. There had been a lot of\ntransition in the Lansing office as Staff 3 was a newer supervisor. Staff 4 meets with\nStaff 3 weekly and records their meetings. The two of them talk every day. Staff 4\nalso is present when Staff 3 meets with his staff for supervision. They also have\nmonthly quality improvement meetings. If issues are found, then they come up with a\nplan to get them taken care of. Staff 4 is confident that the Lansing team can come\nout of this and get back on track. Staff 4 is copied on all e-mails to and from DHHS.\nStaff 1 Interview: Staff 1 was interviewed on 7/1/21 via telephone. She reported she\nworked for the agency for nine months until April of this year. When she started, she\nhad a supervisor who then left the agency. After that she did not have a supervisor.\nStaff 4 was kind of the supervisor. She did not meet with a supervisor until Staff 3\nstarted. She then met with Staff 3 regularly. They would go over her cases and she\nwould share any pertinent information with him. She had difficult cases and they\nwere very hard for her. Staff 3 attempted to support her, but everyone was working\nfrom home. She started the job during COVID so she never saw anyone in person\nand did not know who she could ask questions.\nWith Case A she had trouble getting ahold of the parents. Youth A was supposed to\ngo home but Staff 1 needed to set up home visits with them. The parents for Case B\nwere hard to deal with. Staff 1 met with birth parents every week during parenting\ntime. She would talk to them about the case and services. She did not document\nthese conversations as it was nothing formal. All the cases struggled with getting\nservices completed. She would repeatedly talk to the birth parents about this. Staff 1\nwould talk to caregivers about getting physicals done and would provide reminders.\nShe did not understand the medical passports, so she did not get them done for the\ncases she started with. She was unaware that Medical Passports needed to be done\nquarterly.\nShe completed her virtual training through DHHS in September or October. Staff 1\ndid talk to Staff 3 about her cases before she left. All case documents should be in\nthe case file or uploaded into MiSACWIS. The job was very hard, and she would\noften cry. She had to try and figure out the job on her own. She did not know all the\n6",
    "things that needed to be done. The turnover at the agency was bad and the\nsupervision she received was not quality supervision.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06 Case Planning\nDeveloping the case service plan\nCasework service requires the engagement of the family in\ndevelopment of the case service plan. This engagement must\ninclude an open conversation between all parents/guardians\nand the caseworker in:\n• Discussing needs and strengths.\n• Establishing the case service plan.\n• Reaching an understanding of what is required to meet the\ngoals of the case service plan.\n• Discussing concurrent permanency planning.\nTreatment and Service Providers\nFeedback from professionals working with the child and family\nmust be obtained and incorporated in each case service plan.\nMONITORING, EVALUATING, AND ADJUSTING SERVICE\nINTERVENTIONS\nOnce services and service providers have been identified, the\ncaseworker, in collaboration with the family must monitor the\ndelivery and effectiveness of the services on an ongoing basis\nto determine the family’s level of participation and benefit and to\ndetermine if the services are supporting the goals identified in\nthe case service plan.\nThe caseworker, the family, and the family’s team must regularly\nreassess the strengths and needs of the child and family and\nadjust services, if necessary, to meet identified needs.\nANALYSIS: In reviewing all the cases and interviewing Staff 3, Staff 1 did\nnot adequately address or follow-up on services with the birth\nparents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06H Case Contacts\nCONTACT WITH PARENT/GUARDIAN WHEN CHILD IS\nPLACED OUT-OF-HOME\n7",

They submitted a report from\noutside the system to court. It was not timely, and the Judge adjourned the hearing\nfor one week. The following week they submitted an updated court report the day\nbefore the hearing and the Judge did not get the copy until that morning. Father's\nattorney argued that the report had some inaccurate information, and he did not\nhave enough time to review the report thoroughly. The hearing was adjourned again.\nMiSACWIS and hard copy file reviews:\nFor Case A (Three Updated Service plans were reviewed):\n 10/19/20 report was approved by the supervisor on 11/21/20.\n The report for 1/17/21 – 4/16/21 was completed on 5/10/21.\nFor Case B:\n8",

    "Agency failed to ensure a necessary medical exam was completed for a youth.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe complaint indicated during the FTM for Case C it was determined that in\nJanuary there was some vaginal discharge coming from the then 18-month-old and\nthat the child had been referred to a specialist for further examination. The relative\nnever took the child to the doctor because she said the doctor never returned her\ncalls to schedule the appointment. The agency was unaware of the fact the exam\nneeded to happen even though the medical form was uploaded by their staff.\nMiSACWIS and hard copy file reviews:\nCase A:\n Youth A’s case file indicates she requires regular visits with a Pulmonologist\nand Rheumatologist due to Systemic Idiopathic Juvenile Arthritis. The last\nappointment documented to these specialists was on 1/9/20.\n Nothing in the contacts indicated the staff tried to reach out to the caregivers\nor specialist to schedule appointments or obtain paperwork for appointments\nthat may have occurred.\nCase B: All required medical paperwork was included in the case file.\nCase C:\n There are four children in this case.\n Youth C1 no well child documented prior to January of 2021.\n Youth C2 no well child documented.\n Youth C3 only well child documented was from 2018.\n Youth C4 had a well child visit on 1/29/21.

Two of the four cases\nreviewed did not have adequate follow-up documented for\ntreatment of medical conditions. C4 was referred to a specialist\nhowever this referral was never completed or followed up on by\nthe FCW.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nStaff 3 is a supervisor who reviews service plans. He did not notice that Central\nRegistry Information was in service plans for Case B. He reported in his interview\nthat he ensures the Service Plan’s he reviews have PATP’s however three of the\nfour cases reviewed did not have all the required PATP’s.\nStaff 3 reported that there were many tasks’ Staff 1 did not complete. He also\nindicated Staff 1 would falsify information by entering medical appointments into\nMiSACWIS that did not occur.\nStaff 4 reported Staff 1 was not a good fit for the job.

During interviews and\ndocumentation review it was determined that Staff 3 was\nreviewing and approving service plans without PATP’s attached\nto them and some of those reports included Central Registry\nInformation in the report. It was also reported that there was an\nissue with communication between Staff 1 and Staff 3. Staff 1\nfelt like she did not receive adequate supervision and Staff 3 did\nnot have all the information he needed on Staff 1’s cases prior\nto her leaving.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nINVESTIGATION:\nOf the four case files that were reviewed one case file, Case C, had one medical\npassport completed from 3/31/20.
