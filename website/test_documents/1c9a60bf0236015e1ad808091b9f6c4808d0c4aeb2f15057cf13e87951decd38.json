INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation When youth previously resided at facility, one youth had stomach\naches often and was threatened with write-ups for self-harm when\nthey would vomit. Youth saw the nurse, but never a doctor. When\nyouth previously resided at the facility, they were fed food that\nthey were allergic to, resulting in allergic reactions.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDuring Youth A’s interview at her school on 4/26/23 for another\ninvestigation, Youth A reported she was sick every morning while\nat the facility. She said she threw up and the staff would tell her it\nwas self-harm. This started in December and continued until she\nleft in March. She complained about it every day. She did see the\nnurse who said she was fine and gave her Pepto. Any time Youth\n3",
    "A would write a med complaint it was up to the medical staff if they\nfelt it was necessary to see her or not. It always took too long for\nthe girls to be seen by the nurse or a doctor. Youth A said her\nstomach is better now that she is home. Youth A also reported\nYouth B had food allergies and would have reactions after eating.\nShe said the facility would have to give Youth B an Epi-pen a few\ntimes because they were feeding her food she was allergic to and\nher throat would swell up. Youth B also threw up all the time.\nYouth C was interviewed face to face at her current placement by\na courtesy DHHS Worker on 5/3/23. This consultant participated\nby phone. Youth C reported Youth B had food allergies and the\nfacility did not do anything to find out what they were. When Youth\nB would have hives, get red, and throw up, staff would sometimes\nstab her with an epi-pen and other times they would just let her\nthrow up. Eventually they started to call an ambulance for her.\nAn interview was attempted with Youth B at the home of a friend\non 5/10/23. She refused to be interviewed.\nYouth F was interviewed face to face at her school on 5/19/23 by\na courtesy DHHS Worker. This consultant participated in the\ninterview by phone. She reported Youth B had allergic reactions\nand would throw up every time she ate. They used an epi-pen on\nher a couple of times and called an ambulance. Youth F reported\nthe facility would provide Youth B with alternative foods.\nYouth J was interviewed face to face at her current placement on\n5/24/23. Youth J stated Youth B was allergic to something but\nwould eat it anyway. She had to go to the hospital and get\nmedicine. Youth B's face would break out when this happened.\nThey were not sure what foods she was allergic to. She did not\nknow if anyone else was sick from the food. Youth B went to the\nhospital every time she ate something she was not supposed to\neat. Youth J reported Youth B was given other options to eat but\nshe would choose the ones that made her sick.\nYouth H was interviewed face to face at her school on 5/31/23.\nShe reported any youth who had food allergies would be given\nother food.\nA three-way phone call occurred with Nurse, the DHHS Worker,\nand this consultant on 6/5/23. Nurse stated she no longer worked\nat the facility. She reported there was a youth who complained of\nstomach issues and decreased appetite, but she could not recall\nher name. The youth was scheduled with the Nurse Practitioner\n4",
    "(NP) two or three times. Nurse was asked if it may have been\nYouth A and she stated the name did not sound familiar. Nurse\nalso recalled Youth B having allergic reactions while at the facility.\nThe first time it happened Youth B was sent out by ambulance\nand then was scheduled to meet with the Nurse Practitioner.\nYouth B was also given an Epi-pen. Youth B had to go to the\nEmergency Room (ER) any time the Epi-pen was used. Youth B\nneeded bloodwork for allergy testing but Youth B could not do it.\nAn allergy appointment was scheduled but was cancelled by the\nallergy clinic due to a snowstorm. Testing was rescheduled and\ncompleted but Nurse left the facility before results came in. Youth\nB would vomit immediately after eating Funyuns and her face\nwould get flushed. Youth B never had any airway issues during\nthese episodes. Youth B refused to use the Epi-pen multiple\ntimes. Nurse reported that the kitchen staff made significant\nchanges to Youth B's menu to help alleviate the reactions and\nnarrow down what may have been causing them.\nNurse reported when the youth completed med complaints she\nwould review them and depending on the nature of the complaint\nshe may have seen the youth that day, or others if non-urgent\nthey would triage them. She would typically see youth within 1-2\ndays of getting a complaint. She would assess the situation and\nprovide over the counter medication or put the youth on the list to\nsee NP. NP was at the facility every Tuesday. If the situation were\nemergent, then the youth would be sent out to the ER. She\nreported the youth complete the med complaint, give it to the staff\nto either e-mail it to the medical department or put in a lock box\nthat she would check every Monday - Friday. She reported the\ncomplaints did not always end up in the box.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at his current place of\nemployment on 5/31/23. Staff 1 reported he worked at the facility\nfrom July of 2022 until March. He reported when Youth B came to\nthe facility, she did not have any allergies listed. They were not\naware of any food allergies until Youth B had to use an Epi-pen.\nStaff 1 heard Youth B ate Funyuns then had to go to the hospital\ndue to an allergic reaction. This happened at snack time, and he\nwas not there. A week later he did not give her Funyuns, but she\nstill had a reaction. They tried limiting her diet, but it did not work.\nHe didn’t think it made sense because she was eating fine when\nshe first arrived at the facility. One time Youth B had a reaction,\nand she refused her Epi-pen so they called an ambulance. It took\na few months to get Youth B in for allergy testing. Staff 1 reported\nthat no one ever told Youth B she had to eat items she was\nallergic to. She did not want to eat the food she was given. He\n5",
    "would serve her hot dogs, grilled chicken breast, and hamburger\nwithout the bun.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via three-way phone call with this\nconsultant and the DHHS Worker on 6/7/23. Staff 3 stated she is\nthe Director of Operations and oversees the kitchens at the\nfacility. Staff 3 recalled Youth B and her allergic reactions. She\ncould not remember specifics about the reactions but knew Youth\nB had an Epi-pen and she was scheduled for an allergy test.\nYouth B was brought up during the facility's morning rounds in\nwhich she participated in, so she was informed of Youth B's issues\nfrom those meetings. They were baffled about what was causing\nthe reactions. They tried Youth B on a gluten free, dairy free, corn\nfree, nut free, fish free diet. Then Youth B was pulled out of the\ncafeteria and ate her meals separate from everyone else in case\nthe allergen was airborne. Youth B would eat with staff in a\nclassroom or on the unit. Youth B did get tested for allergies but\nYouth B left the facility shortly afterwards. She thought the allergy\ntest showed minor allergies to dairy.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face by another consultant and this\nconsultant participated by phone. Staff 2 is a cook at the facility.\nStaff 2 reported they accommodate any food allergies. They are\ntold of the allergies by the nurse and get a paper that indicates the\nallergies or special diet. He did recall Youth B having allergic\nreactions to food but they did not know what she was allergic to so\nthey treated her like she was allergic to everything. He said she\nwas tested and found out she was allergic to pepper and garlic.\nHe did not see any allergic reactions as he was working in a\ndifferent kitchen at the time.\nThe DHHS Worker called on 6/29/23 to report she talked to the\nNP who stated she saw Youth B on 1/31/23 and 2/21/23. They did\nin office allergy testing which is not as extensive as the one done\nby the allergy clinic. The in office test showed a slight allergy to\ncow’s milk. Youth B was sent to an allergist. She did not have any\nconcerns about staff not following-up on Youth B's appointments.\nStaff 4 was interviewed by three-way phone call on 6/29/23. She\nworked at the facility from January of 2023 until April. She was the\nprogram manager during that time. She did remember Youth B\nhaving issues with possible food allergies. She was sent for\ntesting and would eat separate from everyone else, but the testing\nshowed she was not allergic to the foods she had eaten before the\nreactions. Staff 4 reported Youth B was not made to eat food she\ncould not eat. The kitchen provided alternative food for her.\n6",
    "Youth G was interviewed by video conferencing on 6/7/23. She\nstated she has food allergies and she once had a reaction to the\nfood. She was given Benadryl and told to use her Epi-pen. She\nreported Youth B also got sick from the food. Youth B was\nthrowing up after she ate anything. She was given an Epi-pen and\nan ambulance was called almost every time she had a reaction.\nWhen Youth B would throw up she would say she is throwing up\nfor a reason but the staff did not listen. She said this happened to\nYouth B once or twice. Youth G reported she didn’t eat much\nwhile at the facility because she has a lot of food allergies so they\nwould feed her the same things over and over again. She said\nthey had a new cook but could not remember his name. She said\nshe was allergic to wheat, peanuts, soy and shellfish that she\ncould remember. They provided her with beef stew and said if she\ndid not eat it she would get written up for it. Both the new cook\nand the staff told her this. She had an allergic reaction with bumps\nall over her. She was given Benadryl and told to use her Epi-pen.\nShe told the staff she was allergic to the food before she ate it and\nshe told the cook after she ate it that she was allergic to it. She\nwas given an alternative to eat but it had veggies in it and she\ndoes not like veggies. This was the only time she had beef stew.\nThey did not serve it to her after that.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23. She\nreported none of the youth ever complained to her about not\ngetting medical treatment. The youth could write a med complaint\nand let staff know and staff would log it and tell the supervisor\nabout the complaint. A lady would come to the unit each day and\ncollect the med complaints. As far as she knew the med\ncomplaints were followed up on. Staff 5 could not remember\nYouth A. She did remember Youth B. Youth B would eat\nsomething and her allergies would flare up. The logbook would\nsay Youth B received treatment. They did not know what food she\nwas allergic to. Staff 5 stated Youth B would get mad about\ngetting different food than the others and she would throw it away.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 6/21/23. She\nstated she did not know about any issues with youth not getting\nmedical treatment. She was unaware of any medical issues with\nYouth A. She reported out of nowhere Youth B would breakout\nand throw-up after eating. She was given an Epi-pen and taken to\nthe hospital. It took a while for Youth B to get her allergy test\nbecause there was not an allergist available. She did not have any\nother youth get sick from eating. Some youth would refuse to eat\nand they would write up a med refusal for it. Youth A was one who\n7",
    "would not eat. Staff 6 said Youth A had a lot of emotional issues\nand this was why she did not eat. Staff 6 said if the girls had to\nhave a special diet a list would be given to the cooks so they could\nprovide the girls with the appropriate food. Youth B would sneak\nfood items from her peers. Youth B then had to eat away from the\nothers in a different room.\nA case conference was held with the DHHS Worker on 7/10/23.\nThe DHHS Worker indicated she would not have any findings.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• DHHS Worker’s notes from her conversation with the\nallergy clinic on 5/25/23: Youth B had an appointment at\ntheir office on 3/8/23 were she tested positive for mild food\nallergies. Symptoms to include hives and upset stomach\nbut her allergies were not severe enough to cause\nanaphylaxis. The doctor did not have any concerns about\nYouth B’s care at the facility.\n• E-mail from Administrative Assistant on 5/30/23: There\nwere not any med complaints or grievances filed by Youth\nB.\n• Youth B Face Sheet: Youth B was listed to have seasonal\nallergies upon her admission to the facility.\n• Youth A Face sheet: Youth A was listed to be allergic to\ntrees, grass, and pollen.\n• Youth B medical documentation: Youth A saw a Nurse\nPractitioner on 1/31/23, 2/14/23, 2/21/23 and the ER on\n1/26/23, 2/10/23, and 2/12/23.\n• Youth B’s Allergy Test Results: A skin test was completed\non Youth A on 3/8/23 at an allergy clinic.

She was seen by NP for follow-up. Another one dated\n2/17/23 stated Youth B could not keep any food down.\nFollow-up scheduled with NP.\n• Youth A medical documents: she saw NP on 10/4/22,\n11/22/22, and 1/3/23. None of the documentation from the\nvisits list any complaints about vomiting.\n• Youth B Incident Reports: 1/26 Youth B’s face turning red\nand her chest hurt, she was given Benadryl but threw it up\nso an ambulance was called; 2/4 Youth B threw up after\ntaking medication and given Pepto; 2/7 Youth B threw up\nshortly after eating, nothing further was done; 2/10 Youth B\n8",
    "threw up and face swelled after eating, she was sent by\nambulance to the ER; 2/12 Youth B threw up multiple times\nand went to ER; 2/13 Youth B throwing up back to back,\nmonitored; 2/27 Youth B threw up several times after\ndinner, given medication for vomiting.\n• Kitchen Production records: records maintained by the\nkitchen showed that all food was up to temperature before\nit was serves and Youth B had her own menu.\nAnalysis From documentation reviewed and interviews conducted there\nwas no indication Youth A reported any stomach issues while at\nthe facility. Further documentation shows Youth B did receive\nmedical treatment for potential allergic reactions.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4149 Resident nutrition.\nSection (1) A licensee shall provide a minimum of 3 nutritious edible meals\nDescription daily unless medically contraindicated and documented.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation When youth previously resided at facility, they were fed raw\nchicken.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nDuring Youth A’s interview she said she thought it was the food at\nthe facility that was making her sick. They were fed uncooked\nchicken that was pink and slimy. A lot of kids were getting sick\nfrom the food especially Youth F.\nYouth C reported the food at the facility was nasty and uncooked.\nStaff 1 gave the youth a bloody piece of chicken. The girls told the\nstaff and the staff said they would tell the supervisor. The youth\nwere not given anything in its place.\nDuring her interview Youth H said the cook, Staff 1, would give\nthem raw chicken breasts. The girls told him he did not cook it\nlong enough. She said this happened a couple of times and\nalways with Staff 1. She said they were once served raw cake\nbatter. A couple of youth threw up from the food. She could not\nremember who those youth were. The girls would tell staff, but\nstaff would be tired of hearing about it. If the staff would talk to\nStaff 1 about it he would just walk away from them or give\nexcuses. Staff 4 talked to him at one point. Staff 4 said the food\nwas disgusting. They always had salad bar and peanut butter and\njelly (PB&J) or Uncrustables as another option. Sometimes the\nbread was moldy or the Uncrustables were soaked through. If the\n9",
    "youth would show the cook that the bread was moldy they would\nbe given a new one.\nDuring her interview Youth F reported Staff 1 would cook chicken\nand it would be raw when he served it. This happened multiple\ntimes.\nYouth J reported there were times when the food at the facility\nwas not fully cooked. Staff 1 said he cooked the chicken to 170\ndegrees. When Staff 1 found out the chicken was uncooked he\nthrew the raw pieces away. Not all pieces were raw. Youth J said\nthis happened a few times. The girls could get PB&J as an\nalternative. If there was no PB&J then Youth J would just not eat.\nShe said it was not just the chicken that was uncooked it was\nother food as well. The supervisors were informed of the issue.\nOnce Staff 1 was no longer working the food was no longer\nuncooked.\nYouth D was interviewed face to face in her home by a Courtesy\nDHHS Worker on 5/2/23. This consultant was not notified of the\ninterview until after it occurred. The DHHS Worker forwarded her\nnotes which stated Youth D reported it was a common occurrence\nfor the food not to be cooked appropriately. She said for example\nthey were all given chicken that was raw and undercooked and\nwhen they discovered there was an issue, they did not provide an\nalternative food option for the night. A message was left for Youth\nD’s father to schedule a follow-up interview, but no response was\nreceived.\nStaff 1 reported the food they provide for the youth comes to them\npre-cooked. He said they are not allowed to serve raw meat. They\nrarely used raw meat. He stated they did serve chicken leg\nquarters that had to be up to temperature prior to them being\nserved. He would always make sure the chicken was at 170\ndegrees even though it only had to be 165 degrees. Staff 1 said\nhe never served raw chicken. The youth knew how to work the\nsystem. If they did not get what they wanted the youth would then\nwrite a grievance.\nStaff 3 stated she creates the menus and trains the kitchen staff.\nThe menus are based on the school breakfast and lunch\nguidelines from the Michigan Department of Education. They\nprovide 5-week rotating menus. One for summer and one for\nwinter. The menus are posted in the cafeteria. She received input\nfrom the youth in creating the menus. Staff 3 said they order their\nfood from Gordon's Food Service. If there are special dietary\n10",
    "needs then she will go out to the health food store or other stores\nand get substitutes. Most of the food they receive is precooked.\nThey heat all poultry to 165 degrees. They do have chicken leg\nquarters every 5 weeks on the winter menu that are not pre-\ncooked. Staff are to cook the leg quarters to 165 degrees before\nserving. They follow the packaging for cooking time and check the\ntemperature. Staff 3 said she never received any complaints about\nuncooked food or staff not following the guidelines. The staff\ncomplete production records that show what the staff fixed for the\nyouth each day. None of the youth were forced to eat uncooked\nfood. She did not have any concerns with Staff 1. She would do\nperiodic walk-throughs and complete temperature checks and\nnever had any issues. Youth always complain they do not like the\nfood so she would have them suggest an alternative for her to put\non the menu. She did not have any complaints about food making\npeople sick. She reported at the bottom of the menu it lists an\nalternative as PB&J which is always an option for the youth. They\nalso put a salad bar out for all lunch and dinners.\nStaff 2 reported most of the food they serve is pre-cooked. The\nonly items not pre-cooked are leg quarters and stew meat. The\nchicken breast and chicken legs are pre-cooked. He said he cooks\nall meat to 165 degrees even if it says 145 degrees. He reported\nhe never heard any complaints about uncooked food when he was\ncooking. The youth can ask for an alternative option if they do not\nwant to eat what is served. Staff 2 said he keeps his thermometer\nwith him.\nStaff 4 reported she always had youth and staff complaining about\nthe food but there was nothing said about the food being\nuncooked and there were no complaints about youth getting ill\nfrom the food. A staff (she could not remember who) reported to\nher there was an issue with the salad bar. She talked to Staff 2\nabout the issue and checked the dates on the food. There were no\nissues. She said the staff did not feel well and they thought it was\nfrom the salad bar.\nYouth G reported some of the meat that was provided was raw.\nShe said it was always the new cook who served the raw meat.\nWhen this would happen she would throw the meat away and not\neat it. One of Youth G's peers (she could not remember who) told\nthe new cook that the meat was raw but he did not say anything.\nThe youth could have PB&J or salad bar instead, but the cook\nwould get mad if they asked for PB&J.\n11",
    "Staff 5 reported the girls always complained about the food, but\nthey would eat it. If they did not want what was offered, they could\nget a PB&J. She did not recall any youth getting sick after eating.\nStaff 6 reported a lot of the youth did not like the food Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 made. If they did not like the food, they could ask for PB&J.\nThe youth would complain about food not being done. They said\nthe burgers were pink so the cooks would re-cook the food. The\nbaked chicken would sometimes look undone. She herself would\nnot eat it. The youth always had another option to choose. She\nsaid this would only happen with Staff 1 and Staff 2. If the food\nlooked undercooked the youth would not eat it.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Staff 1 file: Staff 1 did not have any disciplines in his file.\n• Menus: Winter menu weeks 1-5 were reviewed. Chicken\nbreast were served 3 times during the 5 week period,\nchicken legs twice. The bottom of the menu states PB&J\ncan be a substitution and salad bar is offered for lunch and\ndinner every day.\nAnalysis Based on interviews with staff and review of documentation there\nis no indication the youth were made to eat uncooked chicken.\nConsultation:\nThe agency should review with cooking staff requirements of\ncooking meat to the correct temperature and checking prior to\nserving as most youth and one staff reported they saw meat that\nwas undercooked.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended no change be made to the CCI license.\n7/25/23\n______________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 24, 2023____\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n12"
