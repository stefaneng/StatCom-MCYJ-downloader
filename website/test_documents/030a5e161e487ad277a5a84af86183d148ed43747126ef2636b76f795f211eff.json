    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted after allegations that a staff member (Staff 1) told a youth to 'get the fuck away from me.' The investigation, which included interviews with multiple staff and youth, found that no one could substantiate the claim of swearing, and the youth who made the allegation later revised their account. The agency's policies clearly prohibit such verbal abuse, but the investigators concluded the violation was not established. While the specific allegation was not proven, the report highlights a pattern of concerning interactions and prior incidents involving staff conduct at the facility.",
