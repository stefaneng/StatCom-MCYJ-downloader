INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions.\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff bit Youth C injuring his left upper forearm.\nInvestigation I notified Complainant and Youth C’s foster care worker that I\nwas assigned this complaint. Neither expressed any additional\nconcerns.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nI spoke with Chief Administrator (CA) by phone on Monday\n4/3/23 and requested the incident report, history of Staff 1’s\ndisciplinary write-ups and staff schedules. CA was unaware\nYouth C had a bite mark on his arm. I instructed CA to check\nYouth C’s arm and take him to urgent care immediately if there\n2",
    "was evidence of a human bite or other injuries needing medical\nattention. Afterhours CA emailed that Youth C was taken to\nurgent care.\nI collaborated with Government Worker 1 who observed Youth C’s\narm on 4/3/23 within one hour of receiving the complaint and\nforwarded photos of a red and purple circular bruise the size of a\ntennis ball on his inner left arm that resembled a human bite mark.\nGovernment Worker 1 informed me that CA arranged that Staff 1\nwould not be working with any children at the facility until this\ninvestigation concludes.\nI reviewed medical documentation from MedCare Urgent Care. It\nindicated Youth C was examined on 4/3/23 at 5:47pm. and\ndiagnosed with Human bite of left forearm, Accidental bite by\nanother person, initial encounter. Antibiotics and topical ointment\nwere prescribed.\nI reviewed the incident report noticing it indicated Youth C bit Staff\n1 on his arm. I emailed CA and recommended that Staff 1 also be\nseen by a medical professional. Afterhours on 4/4/23, CA\nconfirmed Staff 1 received medical attention for a human bite.\nI interviewed Youth C, who turned age 18 on 4/4/23, jointly with\nGovernment Worker 1 on 4/5/23. He claimed he did not\nremember most of what happened on 4/1/23 due to short and\nlong-term memory problems.\nYouth C said he takes six or seven pills per day and does not\nknow what the pills are for. According to Government Worker 1,\nhe is being treated for attention and mood disorders.\nIn terms of the allegation, Youth C said, “Staff 1 and 2 were there.\nYouth N was awake in front of the cottage…I threw a book toward\nStaff 2 or Staff 1. I don’t remember…I threw a weight thing behind\nme. It hit the TV. The TV broke…I didn’t break any windows this\ntime…I tried to run out the door. Staff restrained me. They\npushed me on the ground…They fell. They held me on the\nground. I struggled. I don’t remember.” Asked about the large\ncircular mark on his left arm, Youth C said he was not sure if it\nwas a bite, or a bruise caused by the fall. He did not remember if\nanyone bit him.\nIn addition to the bite mark, Youth C had multiple horizontal scabs\nformed from self-inflicted superficial cuts on his inner arm. Asked\nwhat he generally uses to cut himself, he replied casually,\n3",
    "“Whatever I find on the ground.” Youth C had extremely short\nfingernails and scabs around his fingertips. Asked if he bites\nhimself, he affirmed, “I chew on myself a lot when I’m bored.”\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for 10 years. On 3/31/23, Staff 2 said he\nstarted his shift in Juhnke cottage alone monitoring seven youth\nduring sleeping hours.\nStaff 2 recalled the incident on 4/1/23. “I called Supervisor at\n10pm because the kids were not going to bed and were annoying\nYouth C. Youth C busted the window in his room, picked up glass\nand cut his arm. It bled. Two youth ran (with permission) to get\nSupervisor. (Staff 1 arrived) Youth C picked up a weight, hit the\nTV and knocked out (another) window. Youth C threw the weight\nat another (third) window. He banged the window, knocked it out\nand climbed out the window. Youth C came back inside, tore off\nthe TV cover and tried to take the second TV down. He jumped\nup to tear it down and fell on the floor. We (Staff 2 and 1) picked\nhim up. Supervisor arrived. Me and Supervisor escorted Youth C\noutdoors. I noticed Youth C bleeding. He was escalated. I\nverbally deescalated him. We went back in the cottage and Youth\nC calmed down. I got peroxide, cleaned his bloody hands and\ntook off his shirt. I asked if there were any other injuries. He said,\n‘No.’ At 4am, Staff 1 showed me a bite mark on his arm. He\n(Staff 1) said Youth C bit him…I did not see Youth C bite him…I\ndid not see anyone bite Youth C.” The next morning Staff 2 said\nhe “checked in” with the youth and Youth C told him he was\n“good.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. He has\nworked at the facility for 15 years and was suspended on 4/3/23\nuntil this investigation concludes. Government Worker 1 read the\nallegation aloud. Staff 1 appeared puzzled.\nOn 4/1/23, Staff 1 arrived late to Juhnke Cottage due to being\nrelieved late in another cottage. When Staff 1 stepped into the\ncottage, he said he witnessed the following:\n“I saw Staff 2 talking to Youth C and broken glass; the window in\nhis room smashed. Youth C began destroying things; threw a\ntrash can, threw a weight toward me. Staff 2 tried to redirect. I\ncalled Supervisor and asked him to call the cops. Youth C broke\nanother window and broke the TV in the playroom. He went to the\nliving room and broke a second TV. We redirected him. He went\ntoward the front door; smashed a third window and frame. We\n4",
    "were concerned for his safety. We tried to hold his arms to begin\na two-person restraint. We were unsuccessful. All three of us hit\nthe ground. Youth C began to sock me in my chest and face…\n(There were no other kids present) I…got up. Youth C went\noutdoors. I noticed I was bit on my (right lower outer) arm. Five\nminutes later Youth C returned. I wrapped up my own arm. It was\nbleeding. Youth C smiled. I told him he bit me. Youth C said he\nhas very sharp teeth. Youth C had cuts on his fingers. Staff 2 did\na body chart. Supervisor arrived at the cottage.”\nStaff 1 continued, “About 11pm, four squad cars and eight police\nofficers came inside (Juhnke Cottage). They talked to Youth C\nand shook their heads (at the damage). Youth C played his guitar\nfor the police. The police told me, “Good luck. You guys have a\ntough job.”\nStaff 1 said neither he nor Staff 2 ever bit Youth C. In fact, he said\nYouth C never identified a human bite or any other injuries that\nnight aside from the cuts on his hands. “I looked at him; treated\nhim that night. There was nothing there. Youth C has a long\nhistory of suicide attempts and biting himself,” he added.\nI interviewed Youth N jointly with Government Worker 1. He said\nYouth C broke three windows, two TVs, had glass and tried to cut\nhimself. Youth N said he took the glass from Youth C. Glass from\na window cut Youth N’s left inner wrist. Supervisor arrived. Youth\nC calmed down and went outside. Youth N followed him and\nencouraged Youth C apologize to staff and his peers for\ndestroying their means of entertainment. Four police cars and an\nambulance arrived. Youth N left in the ambulance to the hospital\nand got stitches in his wrist at the hospital. In terms of Staff 1\nbiting Youth C, Youth N stated adamantly, “I was there. Staff 1\ndid not bite Youth C. He was not ever close enough to bite him.\nNo one bit him.”\nI interviewed Youth T jointly with Government Worker 1. He said\nhe saw Youth C cut his arm with glass and run outside. Then the\npolice arrived. Youth T provided no additional information.\nThe incident report authored by Staff 1 dated 4/1/23 at 10:45pm\nindicated Staff 1 saw Youth C leave his room after breaking his\nbedroom window. Youth C threw a dumbbell toward staff, broke\ntwo televisions, two more windows, and swung at and hit staff.\nStaff held the youth’s arms to prevent further injury. Youth C\nstruggled. Staff released and the youth and staff fell to the floor.\nYouth C bit Staff 1’s arm breaking the skin. Youth C calmed\n5",
    "down, smiled, and told Staff 1 “I have really sharp teeth.”\nSupervisor was notified and contacted the Redford police. A body\nchart showed fresh cuts on Youth C’s hands but no bite mark.\nThe report did not indicate that Staff 2 was present and involved,\nthat a two-person standing control hold was attempted but\nunsuccessful, that police arrived at the scene and spoke with\nYouth C, or that first aid was provided to Youth C. The body chart\ndid not show the old marks and scars already present on Youth\nC’s his body prior to the incident.\nCONSULTATION\nWhen completing body charts, staff should include all marks\nobserved on the youth’s body including old marks and scars,\nidentifying them as such on the chart. I recommended adding a\nstaff signature line on the chart as well as the date and time the\nchart was completed.\nBefore signing incident reports, supervisors should ensure the\nreport identifies all youth/staff involved, the type of restraint holds\nor protective moves used (i.e., two-person standing control hold,\nblock), unsuccessful attempts to restrain, police arriving at the\nscene, and any first aid provided by staff.\nAnalysis Staff 1 and 2 were in the cottage when Youth C began breaking\nwindows, cutting himself, destroying property, hitting staff, and\njeopardizing the safety of himself and others. To prevent further\ninjury, Staff 1 and 2 attempted a two-person standing restraint but\nwere unsuccessful. Youth C struggled and, in the momentum,\nboth staff and the youth fell to the floor. Staff 1 and 2 did not push\nYouth C to the floor or hold him there.\nDuring the incident Youth C bit Staff 1’s right arm. There was no\nbite mark on Youth C’s body as evidenced by a body chart\ncompleted by Staff 1. There were, however, self-inflicted cuts on\nYouth C’s hands.\nStaff 1 and 2 insisted Youth C never said anyone bit him and did\nnot complain of pain in his upper arm the night of the incident or\nthe next morning. It was not until two days later at school that\nYouth C showed Complainant a bruise/bite mark on his arm. On\n4/3/23, he told Complainant and Government Worker 1 that Staff 1\nbit his arm. On 4/4/23 at urgent care, according to his diagnosis,\nYouth C told medical professionals that he was bit “accidentally by\nan unknown person.” Then on 4/5/23, Youth C told me and\n6",
    "Government Worker 1 he could not remember if or when anyone\nactually bit him.\nStaff 1 is a seasoned direct care worker with no disciplinary write-\nups in his file. All staff and youth who witnessed the event denied\nthat Staff 1 bit Youth C’s arm. Youth C, on the other hand, does\nhave a history of cutting, biting and chewing his own skin, and did\nbite Staff 1’s arm.\nGiven the location of the bite mark (on the inside of Youth C’s\nupper arm), along with his history of biting and chewing on his\nown skin, inconsistent statements, and self-reported memory\nproblems, the source and time of the bite cannot be determined.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 20, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 24, 2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n7"
