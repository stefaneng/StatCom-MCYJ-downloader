    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth went AWOL 1/16/22 and was sexually assaulted while AWOL. Prior to the\nAWOL, youth was using a laptop in their room which is against policies.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 01/20/2021 via online agency complaint.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator via telephone on 01/21/22. She reported Youth A\nhas been at the facility since June of 2021 due to a history of running away and\nbeing homeless. She reported Youth A went AWOL on 01/16/2022 and was sexually\nassaulted. She was taken to Children’s Hospital and then transferred to Havenwyke\nHospital on 01/19/2021 due to suicidal ideation. Staff found Youth A had her school\nChromebook in her bedroom, which the youth had reported she left at school.\nI interviewed Youth A at Havenwyke Hospital on 01/21/2022. Youth A is 17 years old\nand is in the 12th grade. She had been living at Ozone House since June 2021.\nWhile at Ozone House she was attending Ypsilanti Community High School. The\nschool provided her with a Chromebook that she was allowed to take off school\ngrounds. She reported on 01/14/2022, when she returned to the facility after school\nthe staff asked her if she had her Chromebook and she told them she left it at\nschool. She said the staff person did not check her backpack. She reported staff do\nusually check her backpack when she returns from school and would lock up her\nChromebook, but they did not check on that date. She admitted to being on the\ncomputer that weekend and that she hid the Chromebook under her blanket. She\nrefused to provide the staff person’s name. She said staff are supposed monitor her\nwhen she is using computers/Chromebook.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator onsite on 01/31/2022. She reported the facility’s\npolicy for youths when they attend school is that they empty their pockets, and they\nsearch their backpacks. If they have any kind of electronics they are locked up and\nwhen youths are using them, they are being monitored by staff. She reported staff\nwas not aware that Youth A had her school Chromebook until after she went AWOL\nand staff found it in her bedroom. Incident report and a copy of the School\nAttendance Policy for the Safe Stay Program was provided (outlined below).\nI interviewed Residential Manager onsite on 01/31/2022. She reported Youth A has\nbeen at the facility for approximately 8 months. Youth A started out in the short stay\nprogram (Safe Stay) and then transferred to the Minor Youth Transitional Living\nProgram (MyTLP), which is the long-term program. Both programs are in the same\nunit on the second floor of the facility. Youth A has not been compliant with the\nprogram. She reported on 01/03/2022 Youth A told her the school was no longer\nallowing her to bring her Chromebook home, so staff was not aware that she had her\nChromebook in her bedroom. They don’t do bedroom searches unless there are\nsafety concerns. Youth A had been hiding the Chromebook in her bedroom. Youth\nA does have a history of lying and accessing chatrooms.\n3",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 onsite on 01/31/2022. She has been employed at the facility for\n7 months and has completed all new hire training. She reported when youths return\nto facility after school, they are checked with a metal detector and if they have a\nbackpack their bags are also checked. She was working the afternoon shift on\n01/14/2022 and saw Youth A, but she did not check her in because Youth A went to\nthe upstairs unit before coming down to the adult unit. She was not aware that\nYouth A had her Chromebook and did not see her using her Chromebook.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite on 01/31/2022. Youth B is currently in the Safe Stay\nprogram. She has been at the facility for one month. She attends school on-line, so\nshe does not go offsite. She reported staff supervises and monitors her while she is\non the computer. She said youths are not allowed to use the computers without staff\npermission and supervision. She did not know that Youth A had her Chromebook in\nher bedroom. She expressed no worries or concerns and reported feeling safe.\nIn an email received on 02/11/22 from the Executive Director, she explained Ozone\nHouse school policy for the short-term program is different than the policy for the\nlong-term shelter program. When youths in the short-term program return from\nschool a check in checklist is completed on youths. For the long-term program,\ninventory checks are done only on the first day they enter the program and on the\nday they exit the program. Youth A started in the short-term program but then shifted\nto the long-term program on 7/12/2.\nI interviewed Staff 2 via telephone on 02/11/2022. He has been working at the facility\nfor 11 months and has completed all new hire training. He reported when youth’s\ncome back from being in the school/community they have to be checked in and staff\ncheck any items/bags they bring with them. He said they also have a metal detector\nthat they use sometimes. He reported the same process is used for both the Safe\nStay and the MyTLP Program. All electronics are monitored when in use by the\nyouths or locked up. On 01/14/2022 he checked Youth A when she came back from\nschool, but does not recall she had her school bag and was not aware that she had\nany devices on her. After being checked in she went downstairs to the adult\nprogram. He does not recall that Youth A had her backpack with her on that date.\nDocuments reviewed during the investigation:\n Incident report dated 01/15/2022. It noted Youth A asked staff to take out the\ntrash, staff said no. Youth A said she was going to do it anyway. Youth A left\nthe building and got into a van with a man.\n Safe Stay Program (short term) school policy. Staff will complete a Youth\nAttending School Checklist, which details: wake up, leave, and return home,\nmethod of transportation to and from school. The Youth Attending School\nChecklist also provides an area to indicate, completed return inventory,\nreturned electronics, completed School Travel Card, assigned homework,\nprevious homework to be completed, whether homework help is required,\nand staff initials.\n4",
    " MyTLP Program (long term) policy. MyTLP inventory policy indicates that\nstaff complete an inventory form on the day youth enters the program and on\nthe day they exit the program.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all the\nfollowing:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents’ needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in violation as search/inventory policy for the\nMyTLP and Safe Stay programs is inconsistent and insufficient\nto ensure safety. The two programs are on the same unit and\ntherefore having two different policy/procedures causes\nconfusion for staff and youths. Youth A was able to bring her\nschool Chromebook into the facility undetected, putting her at\nrisk of harm having unsupervised online access.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nFebruary 28, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 1, 2022\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n5"
