    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Discipline\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff kicked youth’s knee.\nInvestigation I reviewed intake dated 06/01/2023. It states that on 05/31/2023\nat approximately 2:00PM that Staff Person 1 kicked Youth A’s\nknee. Youth A admits to punching Staff Person 1 in the chest and\npushing her down and that Staff Person 1 kicked Youth A in the\nknee as she was getting up. The incident occurred in the stairwell\nand out of camera view. No staff or residents were present to\ncorroborate what had occurred. Youth A did not sustain any injury\nstates it hurt yesterday and that he refused medical attention.\nVideo does show Youth A getting in an argument with another\nresident after kicking a bucket of water down the stairs. A\nseparate staff member intervened to separate the two and there is\nno indication that Staff Person 1 was involved. Referral Source\nand Case Manager reported no other concerns.\nIncident report dated 05/31/2023 was reviewed. It states Staff\nPerson 1 was called for assistance due to Youth A overturning a\nbucket of water in the stairwell. Staff Person 1 approached Youth\nA to deescalate him to which Youth A responded with “Get the\n(expletive) out of my face before I punch you.” Youth A jumped at\nStaff Person 1 who put herself in a protective stance and\ninstructed him not to do that at which point Youth A punched Staff\nPerson 1 in the chest. Staff Person 1 raised her arm to block her\nchest and called for assistance. Youth A continued to approach\nStaff Person 1 and pushed her down in the stairwell as Staff\nPersons 2 and 3 approached to assist. Staff Persons 2 and 3\nremoved Youth A and Staff Person 1 removed herself from the\narea. EMS arrived and assisted Staff Person 1 with a swollen\nshoulder.\nNo video was observed as it does not cover the stairwell.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite with DHHS Worker on 06/02/2023.\n2",
    "He reports accidentally tipping over a mop bucket and that Staff\nPerson 1 was called over to talk to him. Youth A states Staff\nPerson 1 was telling him to calm down and that he was telling her\nto “Get out of my face” noting that she was standing in front of\nhim. Youth A states he nudged Staff Person 1 away from him as\nhe was standing against the wall and that he nudged her again at\nwhich point she fell to the floor. Youth A states that when Staff\nPerson 1 was on the ground that she kicked him in the shin.\nYouth A then states that Staff Person 1 got up from the ground\nand walked out of the stairway and that other residents came over\nto beat him up. He states other staff were present and walked him\nback upstairs for movie-time. Youth A states Staff Person 2 and 3\nwere present and saw Staff Person 1 kick him. Youth A goes on\nto state that Staff Person 1 is “ok” except when she’s in his face.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n06/06/2023. She reports being employed by the facility for four\nyears as a direct care supervisor with no disciplinary issues. She\nreports responding to assistance as Youth A overturned a mop\nbucket of water. She states Youth A was standing in the stairwell\nwith his back to the wall and she stood in front of him and began\ntalking to him. She reports Youth A jumped at her and she had to\ntake a step back at which point Youth A then punched her in the\nchest. Staff Person 1 states she called for assistance and that\nYouth A then pushed her to the floor and that she was pushing\nherself away from Youth A as he was standing over her. Staff\nPerson 1 states she did not kick Youth A and if she did it was not\non purpose rather that she was trying to move away from Youth A\nwhile on the floor. Staff Person 1 states Staff Person 2 was\npresent just after she fell to the floor. Staff Person 1 states EMS\nwas called to the facility to evaluate her condition at time of the\nincident and notes she was off the schedule on 06/01-06/02/2023.\nStaff Person 1 states she still has a bruise to her left arm.\nI interviewed Staff Person 2 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n06/02/2023. He reports Youth A left staff’s line of sight and that\nhe threw something in the stairwell. He heard that Youth A\nshoved Staff Person 1 and walked over to assist. Upon\napproaching he states he saw Staff Person 1 on the floor and in\nthe process of standing up. Staff Person 2 states he did not\nobserve Staff Person 1 kick at Youth A. Staff Person 2 states he\nbegan to redirect other residents away from Youth A as they were\nmad at Youth A for pushing Staff Person 1 down.\nI interviewed Staff Person 3 onsite with DHHS Worker on\n06/06/2023. She reports Youth A was mad, left line of sight, and\n3",
    "poured water on the floor. Staff Person 1 approached Youth A\nand that he was yelling at her. Staff Person 3 states she did not\nsee Staff Person 1 get punched or pushed down by Youth A, or\nStaff Person 1 kick at Youth A while on the floor though she saw\nStaff Person 1 get up from the floor crying and walk out of the\nstairwell.\nI interviewed Staff Person 4, via telephone, with DHHS Worker on\n06/06/2023. He reports entering the stairwell and observed Staff\nPerson 1 on the floor with Youth A standing over her yelling at her.\nStaff Person 4 states he did not observe Staff Person 1 kick at\nYouth A when she was on the floor or while in the process of\ngetting up. He reports Staff Person 1 appeared distraught and\nwalked out of the stairwell.\nI interviewed Youth B onsite with DHHS Worker on 06/06/2023.\nHe reports hearing yelling and that Youth A hit Staff Person 1.\nOther residents entered the stairwell and began fighting with\nYouth A for hitting Staff Person 1. He states Youth A bit Staff\nPerson 2 as he was in the process of separating the residents\nfrom Youth A. Youth B did not report observing or hearing of Staff\nPerson 1 kicking at Youth A.\nI interviewed Youth C onsite with DHHS Worker on 06/06/2023.\nYouth C does not remember Youth A pushing him prior to\noverturning the mop bucket. He states he heard yelling come\nfrom the stairwell though did not see what was occurring.\nDHHS Worker reports no findings.\nAnalysis It cannot be conclusively determined whether Staff Person 1\nkicked Youth A in the knee as he initially alleges as only Staff\nPerson 1 and Youth A were initially present and there is no video\nsurveillance of the incident. It is noted that Youth A changed his\nallegation to being kicked in the shin rather than the knee during\nhis interview. Youth A did punch Staff Person 1 in the chest and\npush her to the floor requiring EMS attention. Staff Person 1\nstates she did not kick Youth A and if she did it was not on\npurpose as she had fallen and wanted to move away from Youth\nA. The initial allegations state Staff Person 1 kicked at Youth A as\nshe was getting up. Staff entering the stairwell just as Staff\nPerson 1 was getting up from the floor did not observe her to kick\nat Youth A.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n06/27/2023\n______________________________________\nChristopher M Barr Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7/5/23\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
