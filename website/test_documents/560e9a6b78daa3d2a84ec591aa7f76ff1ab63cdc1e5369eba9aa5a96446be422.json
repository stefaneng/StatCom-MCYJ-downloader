EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.",
    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period. The CAP related to the agency’s 2024 Interim inspection where it\nreceived 6 rules violations, where 2 of those were repeat violations. During this\nyear’s Renewal inspection, the agency received 19 rule violations. Of these 19\nviolations, 6 of them are repeat violations, and 3 of the 6 are repeat citations from\nthe 2024 Interim inspection. Of the 3 repeat violations from the 2024 Interim\ninspection, the number of individual cases cited remained the same for 2 of them.\nIt was 1 of 8 in each instance; which were related to R400.413(1)(e) for Medical\nand dental policy; and R400.12419(1)(c) for Initial service plans. In terms of the\nthird repeat violations, the number of individual cases cited remained basically the\nsame. The number of individual cases, for this citation, which was for\nR400.1212(3)(a) for Personnel records, was 7 of 18 in 2024; and 5 of 14 this\ninspection.\nNotwithstanding the increase in the number of rule violations this inspection, the\nagency implemented all action steps within its 2024 Interim inspection CAP. Its\nefforts moving forward are to bring greater compliance in all areas and more timely\nuploaded documentation.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 9/29/2025. The chief\nadministrator (CA) reported on the prior year's violations, and the action steps it\nput in place to achieve compliance. The CA indicated the CAP had measurable\nimpacts in that now orientation and training is documented systematically; and\nevaluation timeliness have improved with proactive reminders, as have medical\nand dental compliance through HLO’s (Health Liaison Officer) involvement and\nweekly reminders. The CA also reported key barriers like CPS staff turnover, high\ncaseloads and staff being on extended leave were factors that contributed to\ndelays in rule compliances\nThe CA reported compliance monitoring will continue to occur via monthly\nsupervisory case conferences; quarterly audits by section managers and the\nquality staff, as well as district-wide KPI meetings, and quarterly all staff meetings,\nwhich the agency believes will have positive aspects. The CA further reported an\nincrease in cases coming in, despite the difficulties that may come with that, has\nallowed case workers to become more adaptable to changes, and to facilitate\ncomplex case management. Additional strengths noted by the CA are the\nagency’s site being deemed a 24-hour facility, allowing them the ability to be more\naccommodating to families and allowing more opportunity to supervise\nparent/child visitations; staff’s ability to engage families; and allocation of an\nadditional social service assistance which can provide case support to workers.\nThe agency also reported it shall continue all efforts to improve and achieve\nongoing rule compliance.",
    "Financial Overview\nNot applicable\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the current chief administrator, section managers,\nadministrative assistant and supervisors, three foster workers and two supervisors\nwere interviewed. The staff interviewed reported numerous strengths and\npositives attributes for the agency. Those strengths included management not\nmicro-managing staff, a structured office environment, approachable coworkers,\nan amicable and approachable district manager, the sunshine morale committee;\nmonthly program meetings; the help of quality assurance staff, a good chain of\ncommand and now having their own district director. As for areas of\nimprovements needed, this included implementation of a trainer/the training unit\nfor new foster care staff, a reduction in case load sizes; supervisors being more\nproactive with educating workers on what tasks are required of them as opposed\nto asking them why they did not complete a task, when the worker may not have\nknown to complete that task; more staff ; and CWTI training being modified to\naddress practical components of the job.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through in the agency's office showed the agency has sufficient space and\nequipment for its staff. The agency has gone paperless, and so current and\nclosed records are electronic files and are secure.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two safety alerts identified.\nSafety Alert # 1: There were no operable smoke detectors on each level of\noccupancy and or near all sleeping spaces. There is no carbon monoxide detector\nin the home.\nResolution: An agency worker made a home visit on 9/3/2025 at which time the\nworker provided the caregiver with three combination smoke/carbon monoxide\ndetectors. The worker assisted the caregiver in installing the three detectors and\nensured they were working. Photos were provided showing that the detectors were\ninstalled.\nAlert #2: There was no operable smoke detector on the second level of the home.\nResolution: On 9/10/2025 the agency worker visited the caregiver's home and\nprovided the caregiver with a new smoke detector. The worker ensured the device\nwas properly installed and was in working order. Photos were attached showing the\ndetector's installation.",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nOctober 13, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 15, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
