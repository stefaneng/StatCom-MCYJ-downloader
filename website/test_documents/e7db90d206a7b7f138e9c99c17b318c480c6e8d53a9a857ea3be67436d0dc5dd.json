One of the offenders remains in the\nhome and continues to harass this youth verbally and physically. The\nyouth remains in his room and isolates himself as a result. Staff are\naware and have not intervened.\nInvestigation Complainant was contacted via telephone on 6/26/25. There was\nno additional information to add about the concern.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face on 06/30/2025 at\nMethodist.

Youth A reported Youth B\ngrabbed his arms daily and attempted to play footsie with him. Youth\nA reported these behaviors crossed personal boundaries and made\nhim feel uncomfortable. He reported he did not feel comfortable\ndisclosing everything but noted Youth B \"kept playing too much\" by\ntouching him. Youth A reported he informed Staff 1 about the\nsituation but felt he was not taken seriously—possibly because he\nwas laughing during the conversation, which may have been\nmisunderstood. He reported while he enjoyed spending time alone in\nhis room playing video games, he did not consider himself isolated.\nYouth A also reported Staff 1 and Staff 2 supervised him and the\nother youth in the cottage at all times and reported there was no\nopportunity for inappropriate behavior to occur unnoticed.

The specialist stated there were no concerns regarding\nMethodist’s supervision of Youth A during his placement there. The\nfoster care specialist also reported Youth A disclosed similar\nconcerns about Youth B. However, when asked to describe how\nYouth B was touching him, it was determined the contact was not\nsexual in nature. Youth A stated Youth B grabbed his arms and\npulled on him, which he did not like. Youth A reported to his foster\ncare specialist Youth B had written him a note asking to be his\nboyfriend. Youth A declined the offer, which he said appeared to\nescalate Youth B's behavior. He reported Youth B then made a\ncomment to him such as, “I will turn you gay,” and proceeded to grab\nhim by the forearm. Youth A reported no marks were left on his skin\nand Youth B let go of his arm when a staff member approached. The\nspecialist noted Youth A has low cognitive functioning and tends to\nreport inappropriate touching without always being able to distinguish\n4",
    "between general inappropriate contact and sexual contact. In this\ncase, the touching was not considered sexually inappropriate.\nAdditionally, the specialist reported Youth A was adamant about not\nbeing housed in the same cottage as Youth B.

Foster care\nspecialist reported implementing a safety plan with Methodist on\n06/25/25.\nSupport Staff was interviewed via telephone on 8/18/25.

Support Staff\nreported initially having concerns about Youth B remaining in the\nsame cottage as Youth A but noted Youth B was eventually moved.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nStaff 1 personnel file: There was no disciplinary record and Staff 1\ncompleted CPI refresher training on 3/20/25.\nStaff 2 personnel file: Staff 2 received discipline on 07/10/25 for\npolicy and procedure violation unrelated to this investigation. Staff 2\ncompleted Trauma informed care on 2/27/25, CPI training on\n2/14/25.\nYoung Person Supervision Policy:\nThe primary function of a residential staff member’s role is to ensure\nthe safety of all young people, which is only accomplished through\neffective and appropriate supervision of the children. Direct\nsupervision constitutes young people being within the line of vision of\nstaff and in close proximity, which means in the same room or area.\nSupervision ensures the safety of all children, by reducing the risk of\nand preventing inappropriate behaviors of young people which is not\nconducive to a healthy treatment environment.\nThe two major methods which staff utilizes to supervise are visual\nand audio methods. Staff members are expected to make ongoing\nvisual assessments of the functioning and behavior of the children\nthey are responsible for. Staff are also expected to attend to the\nverbal communications of individual young people and between\nyoung people\nSome of the other procedures include:\n5",
    "1. Staff members are expected to know the whereabouts and status\nof all young people at all times (clinical, med. appt., visits, activities,\netc.). Whenever young people are being transported staff must\nensure all young people are present and accounted for. When a child\nleaves the area without permission and within sight, staff must be\ndirectly observing the young person. Staff cannot be watching a\nyoung person from inside a building if a young person is outside.\n2. MCHS schedules staff to maintain a 3:1 ratio during waking hour\nand 10:1 during sleeping hours. Staff should strive to maintain this\nratio, though there will be times when staff cannot, such as when a\nyoung person goes AWOL or during a restraint. This does not mean\nthat staff are out of ratio because there are ample staff scheduled to\nrespond to any young person issues.\n3. During sleeping hours, staff must make hourly direct observation\nchecks (i.e. visually being able to physically see the young person’s\nbody) of each young person per hour in the cottages at 15 minute\nintermittent intervals. Young people can be observed by looking\nthrough the door window in the cottages. These checks must be\ndocumented from the time\nthat the young person goes down to his/her room for the night up\nuntil the young person exits their room in the morning in the Midnight\nSupervision Form.\n4. Staff are expected to be mobile within the milieu, not just sitting in\none spot for an hour or more. This includes walking throughout the\nmilieu to the exact physical location of all the young people and\nmaintaining constant awareness of the status of each young person\nin care. Staff members are expected to actively engage young\npeople, by having frequent, ongoing conversations with the young\npeople, having close proximity to the young people, sitting next to the\nyoung people and interacting with them. Staff should pay extra\nattention to them and identifying their strengths, i.e., smile attitude,\nexperiences, and friendliness.\n5. Staff must never leave young people unattended or unsupervised.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance based on staff and youth\ninterviews. The agency followed its supervision policy. All staff and\nyouth reported Youth A and Youth B always remained supervised\nwhile at Stoner. Both staff admitted the youth often horseplay\ntogether but never witnessed any sexually inappropriate behavior\nbetween Youth A and Youth B. No incident reports support claims\nYouth A’s concerns were disregarded. Staff and Youth A reported\nonce Youth A informed staff, Youth B was relocated to a new\ncottage.\nConclusion Violation not Established\n6",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n8/18/2025\n______________________________________\nErica Marshall Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n8/19/2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
