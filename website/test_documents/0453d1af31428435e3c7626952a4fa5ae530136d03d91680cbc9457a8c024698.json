When asked where Staff 1 was when Youth A got out of\nthe bathroom, she did not know and noted Staff 1 was not in the\nhallway. Youth A reported Youth B walked into her room at the\nsame time she got back from her bathroom. She reported Youth B\nput a shoe in between the door so it would not fully close. Youth A\nreported Youth B started to kiss her and tried to take off her\nclothes. She reported she told him no, and he stated he was\nleaving the facility tomorrow, so today was their only chance.\nYouth A reported she told Youth B she was only okay with kissing\nand did not want to do any more. She reported Youth B pushed\nher on the bed and penetrated her vagina with his penis, even\nthough she told him no. Youth A reported she remembered she\nlooked at her clock, and the time was 7:36am when he finished.\nShe reported they came up with the plan for her to go ask Staff 1\nfor something to distract her from noticing Youth B was in her\nroom. Youth A reported she went out of her room at 7:40am and\nasked Staff 1 to get her hair straightener. She reported Youth B,\nthen snuck out of her room. Youth A reported Staff 1 never\ncompleted a room check during that time and reported at some\npoint during sexual intercourse, she noticed the bedroom door\nshut. She reported staff don’t always do room checks during the\nday but stated the overnight staff are always checking their rooms.\nYouth A reported staff during the day will only check on the youth\nif they are gone for over 30 minutes. She reported she did talk\nwith a staff member the next day about this situation because she\nfelt like Youth B took advantage of her. Youth A did not remember\nexactly who she spoke with. She told Law Enforcement she would\nlike to press charges on Youth B.\nYouth B was attempted to be interviewed face to face at the\nPolice Station on August 28, 2025, but refused to be\ninterviewed. Another attempt via phone was made to contact\nYouth B on September 15, 2025, by Law Enforcement and this\nconsultant which there was continued refusal to be\ninterviewed.

She reported Youth B was already awake when she got\nthere. Staff 1 reported she told the overnight shift staff they could\ngo home because she could oversee the youth on her own. She\nreported the next staff member scheduled was at 8am, therefore\nshe would only be alone for less than an hour. Staff 1 reported the\ntwo third shift members left around 7:10am. She reported just after\nthey left, Youth A asked her to let her into the bathroom. Staff 1\nreported a couple of minutes later, Youth B asked to be let into his\nown bathroom. She reported this was when she started to do\nbedroom checks but never checked Youth A’s room because she\ncould hear her in the bathroom. Staff 1 reported she did another\nbedroom check around 7:30am but did not check in on Youth A’s\nroom because she thought she could still hear her in the\nbathroom. She reported she did check Youth B’s room but only\nsaw Youth B’s roommate and suspected he was still in the\nbathroom as well. Staff 1 reported she did not check the\nbathrooms. She reported another youth asked her to go into the\nkitchen for something. Staff 1 reported around 7:40am, Youth A\nasked her to get something out of the staff office for her. She\nreported bed checks should be completed in variable intervals in\nless than fifteen minutes. Staff 1 reported she saw that Youth A’s\nbedroom door was open. She reported she sometimes will knock\non bathroom doors when it is over fifteen minutes, but she could\nhear the shower going, so she did not knock on the door. Staff 1\nreported Youth A and Youth B had a close relationship and had to\nbe reminded to keep appropriate boundaries. She reported she\nwas not aware that Youth A was sexually assaulted by Youth B.\nStaff 1 reported if she could change anything, she would have had\nthird shift staff stay till the next staff got in since all the youth were\nwaking up before the other staff got in to work. She reported she\nwould have also checked the bathrooms.\nDocuments Reviewed\n- Facility’s Supervision Procedure- This procedure notes\nthat “15-mintue checks will be done with youth who are in\ntheir bedrooms or utilizing any private or enclosed spaces\nwithin the Bridge”.

    "summary": "On August 7, 2025, a youth (Youth A) reported being sexually assaulted in her bedroom at The Bridge for Runaways by another youth (Youth B) during the early morning waking hours. The investigation substantiated that Staff 1, who was the sole staff on duty, failed to perform required 15-minute variable interval room checks, did not properly supervise the bathroom hallway as per policy, and left the facility out of ratio (1:9 instead of the required 1:4) by dismissing overnight staff early. While the assault is a criminal matter between residents, the facility and Staff 1 are culpable for the critical supervisory failures that created the unsafe environment in which the assault occurred.",

    "level": "severe",
    "justification": "The substantiated violations involve a sexual assault (Youth B penetrating Youth A against her consent) that occurred due to a failure of supervision. This aligns with the 'Severe SIRs' category for 'Safety and Violence' (sexual abuse) and is directly linked to 'Restraint and seclusion' issues (failure to conduct required 15-minute variable interval checks) and 'Environmental or supervision failures' (staff being out of ratio during waking hours, leading to inadequate supervision)."
