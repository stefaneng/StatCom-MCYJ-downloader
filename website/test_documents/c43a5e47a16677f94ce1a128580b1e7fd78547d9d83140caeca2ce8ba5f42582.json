    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(b) Facilitating services and parenting time for children for\npurposes of reunification.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The child has been in care for three years, is 9 years old but\neducationally is at a preschool level and no IEP was looked into\nuntil the child was at their current home for seven months.\nAdditionally, the child was not receiving mental health treatment\nfor several years before entering their current placement.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 7/18/2025 I spoke with Department of Child Welfare\nLicensing Analyst (DCWLA) by telephone related to the\ncomplaint. DCWLA reported during a home visit with Foster\nParent A, Foster Parent A reported concerns. Foster Parent A\nreported Child B was placed in her home on 12/6/2024, but the\nsystem shows the placement as 12/7/24. Foster Parent A\nreported that Child B, who is age 9, and who functions at a\npreschool age level had been in care for three years, and no IEP\nwas looked into until Child B was placed with her. Nor was Child B\nreceiving mental health services prior to placement with her.\nOn 7/23/2025, I spoke with Program Manager (PM) about the\ncomplaint by telephone. PM reported he and another program\nmanager took over Child B’s and her siblings’ case supervision in\nMay of 2025, following Foster Care Supervisor’s (FCS) departure\nfrom the agency; and Child B’s case transferring to Foster Care\nWorker 2 (FCW 2). PM reported Foster Parent A had reached out\nto him with concerns related to Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW 1)\nand FCS related to them not communicating well and Foster\nParent A feeling FCW 1 and FCS were not addressing her\nrequests timely, such as school related concern. PM reported he\nfelted Foster Parent A concerns rose to the grievance level, so he\nshared the concerns with Chief Administrator (CA). It was agreed\nChild B’s case would be transferred to FCW 2 who resided in the\nsame city that Foster Parent A resides so that this worker could\nbetter meet the foster parent and child’s needs.\nIn regards to an IEP for Child B, PM reported when Child B was in\nChild B’s prior foster home an IEP was requested, but due to the\nchild not being in the foster home long enough for the whole\nprocess to go though, the IEP did not occur. Then Child B was\n2",
    "placed with Foster Parent A and an IEP was requested and is in\nplace. PM reported as far as therapy, FCW 1 was working with\nGenesee County Health System(GHS); and according to reports\nby FCW 1 during the time she was trying to get services in place,\nno therapists were available, and the child was on a wait list until a\ntherapist could be assigned. PM reported FCW 1 would have\nmore details about the mental health services issues and other\nmatters.\nOn 7/25/2025, I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone. FCW 2 reported\nonly being assigned to Child B’s case since 5/12/2025. She\naffirmed PM’s reasoning of poor communication between Foster\nParent A and FCW 1 being the cause as to why the case was\ntransferred to her. She reported FCW 1 kept Child B’s siblings\ncases. FCW 2 reported Child B had had an IEP just prior to her\nbeing assigned the case, with the IEP process starting on\n3/25/2025 and being completed on 4/17/2025. As to why it took\nso long for the IEP to get put in place for Child B, FCW 2 said\nFoster Parent A told her, Foster Parent A was requesting the\nservices, but FCW 1 was not getting things done. Foster Parent A\nreported that FCW 1 was reporting she was working on things, but\nnothing ever got done. Foster Parent A reported it was FCW 1’s\nway of doing things or no way; and FCW 1 would not listen to her.\nFCW 2 reported when she took over Child B’s case the mental\nhealth services Child B was in need of was therapy, and the\ntherapy and tutoring started on 7/8/2025. Child B is receiving\nservices via GHS. She was receiving in-home therapy, support\nservices, community living support (like life/social skills), and\nrespite was added. Child B goes to Day Care after school, and\nduring the summer. FCW 2 reported Child B was not getting\nthese service prior. FCW 2 reported Foster Parent A reported,\nFCW 1 told her Child B did not need the services. FCW 2\nreported believing that FCW 1 had worked on getting the services,\nbut they had not occurred.\nFCW 2 reported at the case transfer meeting with FCW 1 and\nFCS, who is no longer with the agency, they went over the case;\nbut FCW 1 did not report why these service were not in place. Nor\nwhether there were barriers to getting these services. FCW 1 and\nFSC only reported Child B was on the wait list for therapeutic\nservices. She did not report knowledge of any paper work with\nFoster Parent A’s address being somehow diverted to Child B’s\nbirth parent.\n3",
    "On 7/25/2025 I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone about the\ncomplaint. FCW 1 reported initially being assigned to Child B’s\ncase in February 2023. She affirmed Child B’s case reassignment\nto FCW 2 in May 2025, while she kept Child B’s siblings’ case.\nShe reported the case transfer happened because Foster Parent\nA thought she was not doing her job. Foster Parent A was not\nhappy with her, but Foster Parent A was not seeing what she was\ndoing behind the scenes to accomplish things. Foster Parent A\nalso did not like how parenting times were being set up, but FCW\n1 did not expand further. She reported at the end of her\nassignment, Foster Parent A was hostile to her by sending text\nmessages in all CAPs.\nFCW 1 denied Child B was not receiving therapeutic services prior\nto her placement with Foster Parent A. She reported Child B was\nplaced in a relative placement with Fictive-Kin C, when she was\nfirst assigned the case and Child B was receiving therapy in\nschool. Additionally, after Child B was replaced from Fictive-Kin\nC’s home for a couple of months; and prior to her returning to\nFictive-Kin C’s care Child B was in therapy through Community\nMental Health. FCW 1 did not report the name of the Community\nMental Health (CMH) provider. She reported when Child B\nreturned to Fictive-Kin C’s home, Child B continued in therapy via\nschool. FCW 1 did not report the name of the school and was not\nsure if the information was indicated in service plans. She also\nreported when Child B was replaced to Caregiver E’s home, Child\nB received therapy via Washtenaw County Community Mental\nHealth, with Therapist 1. FCW 1 reported having only a few\nemails from Therapist 1 because Child B was only with Caregiver\nE for a short while.\nFCW 1 reported when Child B was placed with Foster Parent A, in\nDecember 2024 Foster Parent A completed a referral for mental\nhealth services via GHS. Child B was on the wait list all the while\nFCW 1 remained assigned to the case. FCW 1 said during that\ntime, she had phone contact with the CMH caseworker to see if\nthere was anything she could do to move the process along.\nShe said Foster Parent A never asked for her assistance in having\nthings move along faster. Foster Parent A was the one informing\nher of what was happening, i.e. the wait list, and of Child B\nneeding therapy because of intensive behaviors. FCW1 reported\nChild B completed a psychological evaluation following the CMH\nintake and that was what prompted the request for intensive\nmental health services by Foster Parent A. FCW 1 said she never\nreceived any paper work on that.\n4",
    "FCW 1 admitted when she first was assigned to Child B’s case in\nFebruary 2023, Child B did not have an IEP. She said Foster\nParent A was aware Child B needed to have an IEP when Child B\nwas placed. She said Child B had undergone an evaluation for an\nIEP at her last school; and that she provided that to School 2.\nFCW 1 said School 2 provided Foster Parent A with information: a\ncopy of an IEP, which Foster Parent A sent to her which she said\nwas an incorrect document. She reported School 2 completed\nChild B’s IEP on 3/25/2025; and Foster Parent A texted her on\n4/17/2025 telling her of the later state date. FCW 1 received a\ncopy of the IEP report on 5/1/2025. FCW denied not working to\nreceive timely services for Child B. She said she was doing her\njob the best that she could, that this was a rough case.\nOn 8/13/2025 I interviewed Foster Parent A by telephone about\nthe allegations. Foster Parent A reported Child B was not in\ntherapy when Child B was placed with her on 12/6/2024. Child B\nhad previously been getting services via New Oakland reportedly\nfor suicidal ideations. She said Child B has not had such behavior\nagain. She said she tried to get Child B services via GHS. She\nreported someone at GHS told her Child B’s worker could get\nChild B a “warm welcome” and get her placed on the wait list\nfaster, but FCW 1 never did that. She said it took until February\n2025 to get Child B’s services; and FCW 1 did not help in any\nway. Currently Child B is receiving services for Post Traumatic\nStress Disorder, which includes teaching and coping skills, and\ntutoring. Child B is also on medication now.\nFoster Parent A reported FCW 1 told her FCW 1 would help her\nget an IEP for Child B, but FCW 1 did not. FCW 1 told her they\nneeded Child B’s parent’s permission to get the IEP. Foster\nParent A said, she did not think that was true, given she had not\nneeded it prior, but she listened to FCW 1. She said a month went\nby and FCW 1 never provided her with a parental permission slip.\nShe said she went to Child B’s school, and the school told her a\nparental permission slip was not necessary. She said, once FCW\n2 was assigned the case, FCW 2 said she was unable to help her\nbecause FCW 1 never provided her information. Foster Parent A\nsaid she ended up getting the IEP on her own. Foster Parent A\nreported that this was the first time she has had a worker not to\nhelp. She said she even filed a grievance and tried to get\nassistance from Program Manager and Chief Administrator who\nbasically said they understood; and changed her worker to FCW\n2.\n5",
    "On 8/15/2025, during an interview with Foster Parent E related to\nanother matter, Foster Parent E reported she was Child B’s 5th\nfoster care placement. She fostered Child B for five month. She\nreported Child B was in therapy through Washtenaw County CMH;\nwhich she got Child B into.\nDocument Review:\nChild B’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Child A was placed in Samaritas’ care on 2/23/2023.\n• She is a temporary court ward.\n• Updated service plans (USP) completed by FCW 1 from\n4/29/2023 to 4/16/2025.\no A 12/23/23-4/29/2023, and 4/30/2023- 7/29/2023\nUSP showing case documentation that Child B was\nreceiving therapy via school.\no Various USP’s after 7/27/2023 indicating an intake\nappointment was attended by FCW for therapy,\nchild was in therapy or was in need of therapy.\no No indication about therapy or a lack of process\nabout getting therapy for Child B in the 1/25/2024-\n4/23/2024 USP\no A social work contact in the 4/24/2024-7/22/2024\nUSP treatment plan that indicated Child B was in\nprocess to get a new therapist after her\nreplacement.\no A 7/23/2024-10/18/2024 USP that indicated Child B\nis in therapy weekly and her behavior issues have\nreduced in the last two weeks.\no No indication about an IEP being in place or needed\nin the earlier USPs; and a social work contact in the\n10/27/2023-1/24/2024 USP that indicated an IEP is\nneeded and will be completed.\no A social work contact in the 10/19/2024-1/16/2025\nUSP that indicated a court hearing notation that an\nIEP was to be completed.

    "was in the process of completing an IEP at school.\nThis 3/10/2025 contact did not mention an update\non therapy but indicated a concern with Child B\nsqueezing and killing the family’s bird.\n• The only service listed in the MISACWIS case service\nsection of the record for Child B was an evaluation/paid\nmental health service for a Trauma Assessment on\n8/11/2022 with Dr S.

    "Analysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed Child B was receiving therapy prior to her placement with\nFoster Parent A.\nOnce Child B was replaced to another county a new intake was\nrequired, and Child B was placed on a wait list until she was\nassigned a therapist. The record, nor FCW 1 provided proof of\nefforts FCW 1 made to assist the foster parent in securing the\ntherapy change/reinstatement in a new county.\nNor that FCW 1 sought to secure a timely IEP for Child B. Child\nB’s case documented a need for an IEP at least as far back as\nOctober 2023 and documentation and reporting showed one was\nstarted later in 2024, but not secured until after Child B’s\nreplacement with Foster Parent A.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12409 Education.\nSection (1) An agency must ensure that, within 5 school days of\nDescription placement, an agency shall provide for the enrollment of each\nchild of school age, as defined by state law, into a school\nprogram.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation A child was in placement for 19 days before entering school. The\nfoster care worker was not assisting the foster parent with needed\ndocuments to get the child enrolled.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 7/18/2025 I spoke with Department of Child Welfare\nLicensing Analyst (DCWLA) by telephone related to the\ncomplaint. DCWLA reported during a home visit with Foster\nParent A, Foster Parent A reported Child B was placed in her\nhome on 12/6/2024 but Child B did not get enrolled in school until\n19 day later. Foster Parent A reported she was in need of Child\nB’s birth certificate to get Child B in enrolled in school, as the\nschool had asked for that, but Foster Parent A reported knowing\nshe did not need the birth certificate to enroll Child B. Foster\nParent A reported the school was not allowing her to enroll Child B\nin school; and Child B’s worker, FCW 1 was not assisting her with\nthe documents needed to get Child B enrolled. DCWLA did not\nelaborate as to whether Foster Parent A reported needing more\nthan just Child B’s birth certificate to get Child B enrolled.\nOn 7/23/2025, I spoke with Program Manager (PM) about the\ncomplaint by telephone. PM denied the allegation. He confirmed\n8",
    "Child B’s placement in Foster Parent A’s foster home as of\nDecember 2024 and reported Child B got enrolled in school\ntimely. He was not sure that enrollment was within 5 days. He\nsaid FCW 1 was in touch with the school, and they were going\nback and forth; and in the mix of those contacts, Foster Parent A\nreported not wanting Child B to enroll in the school in their home\narea. Foster Parent A wanted Child B to go to another school, a\nschool of choice. PM reported due to Foster Parent A wanting a\n“choice school” there was a lack of communication between\nFoster Parent A and FCW 1; and getting Child B that choice\nschool delayed enrollment. He reported these things were also all\nhappening in December; and there was the holiday break.\nOn 7/25/2025, I interviewed FCW 2 by telephone. FCW 2 reported\nwhen she was assigned to Child B’s case on 5/12/2025; Child B\nwas already in school. She said Child B has been enrolled in\nSchool 2, since some time in December 2025 and Child B started\nschool on 1/6/2025. FCW 2 reported what she understood the\ndelay in getting Child B enrolled in school was that there was\ncertain paperwork Foster Parent A needed from FCW 1. FCW 2\nwas not sure what that paper work was. She said Foster Parent A\nreported FCW 1 told her it was hard getting the paper work signed\nby the birth parent; but Foster Parent A was not clear on all of\nwhat all was required or needed.\nOn 7/25/2025 I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone about the\ncomplaint. FCW 1 reported Foster Parent A was insistent that\nChild B go to a “choice school,” School 2. FCW 1 reported in\norder for Child B to go to that school, a release had to be signed\nby the Flint School District according to Foster Parent A. FCW 1\nreported Foster Parent A said Foster Parent A was having a\nproblem getting the release. FCW 1 said she called the Flint\nSchool District a week after 12/7/2024 asking about this release\nmatter, and what else might be required to get Child B into School\n2. She said she also has an email dated 12/12/2024 asking how\nto complete the release; and sometime after that, on a day she\nwas not sure of, the Swartz Creek District, where School 2 is\nlocated in called her to say there was nothing more she could do\nto speed up the process and they did not need any other\ndocuments. FCW 1 reported for the Flint School District to give\nadministrative approval for the enrollment, Foster Parent A\nneeded to fill out a form that showed she had other children in\nSchool 2. FCW further reported to having a text message from\nFoster Parent A dated 12/19/2024 saying Child B is enrolled in\nSchool 2 and Foster Parent A was awaiting a call from School 2\nas to what building Child B would be assigned to. FCW 1 reported\n9",
    "that since school was out for Christmas break on 12/19/2025,\nChild B did not start school at School 2 until 1/6/2025, which was\nthe first day back from the school’s Christmas break.\nOn 8/13/2025 I interviewed Foster Parent A by telephone.\nFoster Parent A reported Child B was placed with her on\n12/6/2024, which was a Saturday. It is noteworthy that 12/7/2024\nnot 12/6/2024 is a Saturday. Foster Parent A said she had until\n12/19/2024 to get Child B enrolled in school. She did not\nelaborate as to why that date, but the last day of school before the\nschool’s Christmas break was 12/20/2024. She acknowledged\ntrying to get Child A into School 2 and the release process. She\nsaid Child B lateness in getting enrolled in school was due to a\nlack of assistance from FCW 1. She reported not being able to get\nChild B enrolled without a birth certificate; and that she needed\ninformation about the child’s previous school. She asked FCW 1\nfor assistance with the documentation, but FCW 1 never provided\nher with the birth certificate. Nor was the school release\nprovided/obtained, which on 12/8/2024 FCW 1 told her she would\nprovide. Foster Parent A said, she also tried to enroll Child B into\na Charter school that was 2 blocks from her home. FCW 1 would\nnot provide her the prior school information for the school to\naccept Child B. Foster Parent A said she also contacted FCS and\nFCS reported her case was not the only case they had and was\nnot helpful.\nDocument Review:\nChild B’s MISACWIS case record that showed:\no Child B’s placement history information at listed earlier in\nthis report.\no Child B’s start date at School 2 as 1/6/2025.\no A 12/9/2024 social work contact by FCW 1 that indicated a\nhome visit was conducted in Child B’s new placement\nstating “Foster parents need enrollment paperwork to enroll\nChild B in school.”\no No documentation of an email or phone call by FCW 1 to\nthe school or another entity after Child B’s 12/7/2024\nplacement related to getting Child A enrolled in school. Nor\ndocumentation of a contact from the school to FCW 1.\no No documentation of a text message showing Child B was\nenrolled in school within five day of her 12/7/2024\nplacement with Foster Parent A.\nInternet information related to The Swartz Creek School District\nwinter break closure:\no School broke for winter break on 12/20/2024.\n10",
    "o School resumed 1/6/2025.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed Child B entered placement with Foster Parent A on\n12/7/2024, and Foster Parent A requested Child B attend a school\noutside of her residing area. The school choice request by Foster\nParent A and the fact that the school district broke for winter break\non 12/20/2024 until 1/6/2025 may have created added\ncomplication to the foster parent getting Child B enrolled in that\nschool timely per the rule. But not a nearby school which Foster\nParent A also attempted to get Child B enrolled in.\nThe evidence did not show that FCW 1 aided Foster Parent A with\neither school enrollment endeavors. Foster Parent A reported a\nlack of assistance; and conversely FCW 1 reported assisting by\nmaking a call and emailing the school. Those contacts by FCW 1\nare not shown in Child B’s MISACWIS case record\ndocumentation. Additionally, the case record showed a social\ncontact by FCW 1 on 12/9/2024 that the foster parent needs\nenrollment paperwork to enroll Child B in school. There was no\ndocumentation after indicating the paperwork was provided to\nFoster Parent A or the school. Nor that paper work was no longer\nneeded or required. Therein the child was not enrolled within five\ndays of her placement as required by this rule.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent license status is recommended.\n9/25/2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 25, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
