    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4124 Communication\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a written policy regarding\nDescription communication that ensures that a child is able to\ncommunicate with family and friends in a manner appropriate\nto the child's functioning and consistent with the child's\ntreatment plan and security level.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A has not been allowed to have contact with her attorney or\nprobation officer for months.\nInvestigation Youth A was interviewed on 03/13/2025 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. Youth A identified Staff 1 as the\nmain, assigned staff to assist youth with making outgoing phone\ncalls. She stated her concern was not with Staff 1 but other staff\nthat do not respond appropriately to her requests to make\noutgoing phone calls. Youth A was not able to give specific\nexamples of staff or specific instances but referenced general\nresponses she received when she asked to make phone calls to\nher mother, probation officer or her attorney. Youth A recalled\nbeing told that moment was not a good time to attempt to make a\nphone call as a common response. She was not able to recall the\nlast time she attempted a phone call. Youth A stated she has\nbeen able make outgoing phone calls to everyone she mentioned\nbut expressed concern she has not been able to do so in a timely\nmanner. Youth A confirmed she has received incoming phone\ncalls from her mother, and her probation officer has visited her\neach month during her placement at the facility. Youth A also\nreported having contact with her attorney before and during court\nhearings in which she has participated virtually.\nStaff 1 was interviewed on 04/18/2025 over the phone. She\nconfirmed that she was a staff at the facility responsible for\nhelping youth make outgoing phone calls. Staff 1 recalled Youth\nA approaching her personally at times to ask about making a\nphone call, and in addition recalled instances, without specific\ndetail, of other staff telling her Youth A wanted to make a phone\ncall. Staff 1 recalled some of Youth A’s outgoing phone call\nattempts. She remarked Youth A’s mother did not often answer\nthe phone or return phone calls to Youth A. She remarked Youth\nA had been able to make successful outgoing phone calls to her\nprobation officer. Staff 1 recalled the facility did not have the\ncontact information for Youth A’s attorney for some period of time\n2",
    "but they were able to obtain that from the probation officer, and\nsince that time Youth A had attempted phone calls with her\nattorney. Staff 1 did not believe Youth A asked to make phone\ncalls any more frequently than any other youth in the facility. Staff\n1 stated youth are not allowed to attempt to make phone calls\nwhen they are engaged in another activity, such as during school\nhours or after school when they are participating in individual or\ngroup treatment, so there are times when opportunities are not\nfrequent to make outgoing phone calls to individuals who are likely\nto answer the phone only during business hours. Staff 1 believed\nyouth’s requests to make phone calls are generally met within the\nnext day of that request.\nYouth A’s Probation Officer was interviewed on 04/18/2025 over\nthe phone. She recalled receiving phone calls from Youth A since\nshe was assigned to Youth A’s case while placed at the\nfacility. She expressed no concern over the facility’s handling of\noutgoing phone calls. Probation Officer also stated she had been\nable to make monthly face-to-face contact with Youth A at the\nfacility and Youth A never expressed concern to her over inability\nto make outgoing phone calls. Probation Officer recalled\nproviding the contact information for Youth A’s attorney to the\nfacility, but was not aware of any attempt by Youth A to\ncommunicate with her attorney.\nAttempts were made to interview Youth A’s attorney on\n04/14/2025 and 04/18/2025 and no return contact was made.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Facility policy titled “Client Rights” was provided and\nreviewed. This policy stated, “Clients are permitted to\nmake and receive personal telephone calls to approved\ncontact persons.”\n• Documentation of Youth A’s visitation contacts from the\nfacility since late December 2024 was provided and\nreviewed. Youth A was provided the opportunity to attempt\nphone contact with her mother on a weekly basis. Youth\nA’s probation officer made face-to-face visits to the facility\nin January 2025.\n• Email communication between facility staff and Youth A’s\nprobation officer was provided. This referenced attempts\nmade by the facility in February 2025 to collaborate with the\nprobation officer and also requests made to gain the\ncontact information of Youth A’s attorney.\n3",
    "Analysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed Youth A was afforded the\nopportunity to have phone contact with approved individuals.\nTechnical assistance:\nThe facility was offered technical assistance to ensure that all\nnecessary contact information for members of a youth’s case is\nprovided to them at the time of placement.\nConsultation:\nThe facility was offered consultation to update procedures\nregarding specific times of day for outgoing phone calls and\nclearing inform youth that calls will not be made during scheduled\nactivities unless in case of an emergency.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n04/18/2025\n__________________________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 23, 2025\n__________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
