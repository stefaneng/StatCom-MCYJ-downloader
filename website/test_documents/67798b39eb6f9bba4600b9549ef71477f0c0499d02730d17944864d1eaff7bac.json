The kitchen\nis right off the chow hall and consists of a prep area, dishwashing area, walk-in cooler,\ndry goods, closet and cooking area. The school consists of 4 main classrooms, for\nMath, Science, Social Studies and English, respectively. The training center consists of\na large area for training and various surrounding offices. The administrative offices are\nfive in number, and are located around the outer wall of the chow hall.\nThere are also three off-site facilities used by cadets in the program. These include the\nGED school testing and teaching area, the Food Distribution Center and the Strength\nTraining Center. The GED class building consists of two rooms – one room for teaching\nand preparing youths for GED testing and the other room for taking the GED test. The\nFood Distribution Center consists of two offices, a large dry goods storage area, a\ndishwashing area, three walk-in coolers/freezers, and an area for cutting and\nprocessing meats. The Strength Training area consists of a cardio-vascular workout\narea, a weight lifting area, 2 offices and 2 shower/changing rooms.\nB. Program Description\nThe Clarence Fisher Leadership Academy is a residential treatment program with a\ncapacity to serve 78 male youths. The Academy provides 24-hour-per-day care to\nyouths that are 12 to 17 years of age at the time of admission. The average length of\nstay is 6 months, varying primarily on the commitment orders of each youth and their\ndedication to their treatment program.\nThe goal of the CFLA is to provide for the social, moral, emotional, educational, and\nsustenance needs of all its residents, and to bring about behavioral change through\npeaceful coexistence. The principles taught in the program are reality, respect,\n2",
    "responsibility, communication, negotiation, education and love. They are taught through\nan eclectic approach to social treatment.\nThe milieu is structured by a behavioral point-level system/token economy, called the\nMotivation and Learning System. Robert Wollack developed this system in the 1970’s.\nThis treatment approach, combined with Glasser’s Reality Therapy, comprises the\nprimary treatment modality in all of Wolverine’s programs. What makes the CFLA\nprogram different is the incorporation of military structure and discipline, which teaches\nyouth appropriate self-confidence and self-control, facilitates effective interaction with\nauthority figures, and develops polite pro-social communication and behavior.\nThe CFLA program includes pre-vocational and vocational training, group, individual,\nfamily and substance abuse counseling, gang related behavior intervention and social\nskills development and enhancement. The program also provides work\nskills development, basic, special, and health education services, physical fitness\nand recreational activities, medical and dental care, on site family visitation,\ntransportation services for the families of youths, post-placement planning and\npsychological/psychiatric services.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe Clarence Fisher Leadership Academy program was reviewed as part of the\noverall Pioneer Work and Learn Center review conducted May 7, 18, 19 and 21,\n2004. All identified rule violations have been corrected, and the facility is in\ncompliance with all applicable rule areas. A full review of the Clarence Fisher\nLeadership Academy program will be conducted at the end of the six month Original\nProvisional period.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that an Original Provisional License be issued effective 9/2/2004.\n________________________________________\nDavid Fein Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n________________________________________\nJackie Horton Date\nArea Manager\n3"
