EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during the licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with the CAP is as follows:\nThe agency renewal inspection was completed on 2/5/24 and the CAP was\napproved on 2/28/24. The agency was cited for four violations, none of which were\nrepeated this year. In the 2023 interim review, 7 violations were cited, none of\nwhich were repeated this year. The agency reported successful implementation of\ntheir 2024 CAP, as is reflected in the current review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed. The chief\nadministrator reported some challenges with staffing over the last year, due to\nstaff turnover and some staff leave of absences. However, staff pulled together\nand assisted one another to meet goals and serve clients. The chief administrator\nreported the agency implemented their previous CAP by updating tools,\nprocesses, and utilizing reminder system for due dates. These activities appeared\nto be effective as there were no repeat violations, and few citations.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency’s annual budget and 2024 financial audit were reviewed. No financial\nconcerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed face-to-face at the agency. Both staff reported being\nvery happy in their positions. Both staff stated their supervisors were outstanding.\nSupervisors were described as being knowledgeable, helpful, and supportive.\nStaff stated everyone at the agency works together well and there were no\nsuggestions for improvement.\n3",
    "Description of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency remains in the same location as previous years. The building has\nadequate office space for staff, and visitation and meeting space for children and\nfamilies. All case files were stored securely, and the agency maintains a cross\nshredder for disposal of confidential information.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one identified safety alert.\nSafety Alert # 1: The home was observed to be extremely cluttered. The children’s\nbeds did not have bedding and clothing, toys and various items were strewn about\nthe bedroom. The kitchen/dining area had several boxes and crates stacked from\nthe floor to the top of the table. Broken chairs were stacked on top of each other.\nThe home had an odor of dog urine and feces.\nResolution: The caregiver was provided with clear expectations by the agency to\nresolve the safety alert. A follow-up home visit was completed by the foster care\nworker and licensing supervisor. The home was observed to be decluttered, the\ncarpet shampooed, and the beds had clean linens. Photos were provided to DCWL\nas verification.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n_____________February 28, 2025______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nFebruary 28, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
