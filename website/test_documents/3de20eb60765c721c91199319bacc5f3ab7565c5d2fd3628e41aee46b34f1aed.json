    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during\nthis licensing period.\nThere was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nOne special evaluation, completed on 2/8/22, determined the foster parent was in\nviolation of rule 404 Behavior Management and rule 201 Foster Parent\nQualifications. This violation was due to the foster parent consuming alcohol and\naccidentally scratching her son, in front of the foster child. A CAP was developed\nand completed on 5/4/22. The CAP included monthly contact with the licensing\nworker, grief counseling, individual therapy, anger management class, alcohol\neducation course, a substance abuse assessment, and a psychological evaluation.\nOverall, it was determined the agency handled the special evaluation appropriately\nand addressed the underlying issue of the caregiver’s grief over a recent loss. There\nwere no prior investigations with this foster home and there have been no further\nconcerns since.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period. After the 8/9/21 interim review, a CAP\nwas developed and approved on 9/17/21. During this review, it was determined the\nagency has minimal compliance with their CAP. This is reportedly due to ongoing\nstaffing issues. The Chief Administrator reported difficulty in implementing CAP\nitems, as staff turn-over had been high. While new staff have recently been hired,\nthey require time to get into routines. In 2021 the agency was found to have 29 rule\nand contract/policy violations. During this 2022 review 38 violations were found,\nincluding 10 repeat violations from 2021 and 7 repeat violations from 2020. The\nagency was advised that improvement in the repeat violations is necessary over the\nnext review period. The agency must develop a strong CAP, with measurable action\nsteps to address all violations. It was advised that once the CAP is approved, the\nagency should review the CAP and discuss it often with staff and supervisors. The\nagency should also determine strategies to monitor and review certain items to\nensure they are being completed thoroughly and timely. As always, DCWL is\navailable to provide consultation for any of these areas. Not only during the CAP\ndevelopment, but on an ongoing basis.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed with the Chief\nAdministrator. The Chief Administrator (CA) reported struggling this year due to\nsignificant staff turnover, including supervisory positions. Hiring continues to be\ndifficult due to a lack of qualified applicants, as has been seen throughout the state.\nCA stated restructuring of the management team has occurred. Plans for retention\nand increased staff oversight are also being developed. In addition, the agency has\nbeen slow to accept new placements, as they want to improve their staffing stability,\nbefore increasing their case numbers. CA identified some of the areas they have\n16",
    "had difficulty with including obtaining PATP and medical passport signatures,\nobtaining medical/dental documentation from offices, case contact entry, general\ndocumentation, and ILP specific documentation. CA has also identified some areas\nthat have shown improvement, including borrowed bed files, supervisor tracking of\nservice plans, worker/supervisor contacts, worker/child contacts, and FTM\ncompletion- although it was noted documentation in the system has not been\ncompleted as required. CA believes the agency continues to do good work and has\nshown improvement over recent months, although it may not be reflected in this\nreview. The CA is confident that the recent transfer of a FC Supervisor to this office\nfrom another region, will assist with showing marked improvement over the next\nyear.\nInterviews\nThree staff were interviewed on-site. Staff reported being employed with the agency\nbetween two months and one year. Staff stated their caseloads were manageable,\ntheir supervisors helpful, knowledgeable, and able to communicate well. Overall,\nthey reported the agency was a great place to work. None of the staff expressed any\nconcerns. However, the newer staff stated that more job shadowing or hands-on\ntraining would be beneficial.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, and contract/policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be\nissued a renewal of their regular license.\n__ ________________June 16, 2022__________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 17, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\n17",
