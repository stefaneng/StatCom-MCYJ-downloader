Foster Care\nWorker called dispatch, and officers went out to Parent A’s home.\nParent A was not there, but the youths’ father was and gave the\nofficers a number to reach Grandparent B. The officers called the\nnumber and told the paternal grandmother to bring the youth to\nthe police department. Once the youths were brought to the police\ndepartment, they were brought to Foster Care Worker at the\nlibrary. Foster Care Worker then drove the youths back to their\nfoster homes. During the drive, Youth B told her that his\ngrandmother does not like Foster Care Worker and that she\nshouldn’t be around the youths after which Youth A told Foster\nCare Worker, “you are not a bad person.” The youths told Foster\nCare Worker they went to their Grandparent B’s house then the\npolice department.
