The\nchild's racial, ethnic, and cultural identity, heritage, and\nbackground may only be considered if an assessment of\nthe individual child indicates that such consideration is in\nthe best interests of the child.\nTwo of the three current foster home files reviewed contained foster home\nevaluation reports that did not meet the standards of this rule. In the first file the\nevaluation dated 4/30/2021 gave a recommendation for a specific child but did not\nidentify the characteristics associated with the child as required by this rule. In the\nsecond file the license indicated an age range (a) of 0-2 years and the\ncorresponding evaluation recommended an age range of 0-3 years.\nR 400.12324 Reevaluation.\n(8) An agency shall complete a reevaluation and shall make\na licensing recommendation to the department at least 15\ncalendar days before the expiration date of the foster home\nlicense.\n2",
