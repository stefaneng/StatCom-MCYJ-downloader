    "FOM 722-08E Action Summary\nPage 3 and 6\nPlacement Change: Prior to a planned placement change, or\nwithin three business days of an emergency placement change,\nthe caseworker must document…\nFoster Care/ Juvenile Justice Program/Case Closure Within\nthree business days of foster care and/or juvenile justice\nprogram/case closure, the caseworker must document…\nThree of nine foster care and independent living files did not have action summaries\ncompleted within the required timeframes.\nFOM 722-06H Case Contacts\nPage 19\nAll case contacts must be entered in MiSACWIS, including\nattempted contacts and missed appointments. The case contact\nnarrative should consist of a brief summary of the contact.\nSignificant information obtained during the contact must be\nsummarized in the appropriate section of the case service plan.\nThe caseworker must enter the required face-to-face contacts\nlisted below in MISACWIS within five business days of the\ncontact. This includes attempted and missed face-to-face\ncontacts.\nSix of nine foster care and independent living files did not have face to face contacts\nentered into MISACWIS within the required timeframe.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n Signatures- The MDHHS Policy office recently clarified that PATPs and Medical\nPassports need to be signed by any non-respondent parent that has placement\nof their child. This non-respondent parent must sign as the ‘placement provider’.\nAs this was previously unclear in policy, the missing signatures were not cited.\nHowever, the agency was advised this expectation will be required going\nforward.\n Signatures- The agency was reminded to note on the signature line of any\ndocument where a parent signature is required, if the parent refuses to sign or\ncannot be located.\n MISACWIS- The agency was advised to consult policy for timeframes required\nfor documents to be uploaded into MiSACWIS. Although there have been\nchallenges with uploading documents due to staff working remotely during the\n5",
    "pandemic, it is expected that documents will be uploaded within the required\ntimeframes.\n IL/YAVFC- Clarification was provided to the agency that all IL Licensing Rules\nmust be followed for all youth residing in a IL placement type, including those\nyouth with YAVFC legal status.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVII. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe CAP (approved 10/29/2020) was a result of the 10/26/20 renewal evaluation.\nDuring this review the agency only had one repeat violation, which was due to a\nmisunderstanding regarding the need to follow IL rules for YAVFC cases. Overall,\nthe agency showed compliance with their CAP and improvement in several areas.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment indicated the past year was challenging with\nstaff working remotely due to the pandemic. Staff had difficulty with printing and\nsigning documents as they could not print at home and were not able to go into the\noffice. In addition, there were several policy changes during this review period, which\nstaff had to adjust to. Overall, staff reportedly handled these challenges well and\nadapted as needed. The CA reported that monthly CAP meetings were held virtually\nto ensure CAP compliance through their quality assurance practices. The group\nwould bring the management team and case workers together to review progress\nmade, hear challenges or ideas, and make changes to the CAP if needed. The CA\nindicated this has been successful in showing the whole team how their actions\naffect compliance.\nInterviews\nTwo staff were interviewed, one foster care and one licensing. Both staff reported\nthe past year was challenging due to the pandemic, but supervisors and\nadministration have been very helpful. Both staff reported feeling supported and\nencouraged in their job. Neither staff had suggestions for improvements that could\nbe made at the agency.\n6",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ ________________October 18, 2021__\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 18, 2021\n_______________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
