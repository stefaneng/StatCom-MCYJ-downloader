    "ANALYSIS: After interviews with Parent A and Staff Z, it was determined\nthat Staff Z did move Child 1 away from her computer however it\nis unable to be determined if Staff Z “grabbed” Child 1 or “gently\nmoved her hand”. Parent A and Staff Z both reported that Child\n1 was not injured. Parent A did report Staff Z did not act in an\naggressive manner when moving Child 1 therefore, the violation\nis not established.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nOn 10/30/20, agency staff did not use car seat properly while transporting the child.\nThe car seat was not properly buckled.\nINVESTIGATION:\nParent A was interviewed via telephone on November 2, 2020.

Parent A said on Staff Y\nbrought Child 1 to the visit on October 30, 2020. Parent A explained that Child 1 is 2\nyears old and needs to be transported in a 5-point harness car seat. Parent A said\nwhen Staff Y arrived for the visit Parent A went to get Child 1 out of the car and\nrealized the car seat was not buckled into the car but rather the seat belt was over\ntop of the car seat. Parent A said Child 1 was sitting in the 5-point harness car seat\nhowever was not strapped into the seat, the seatbelt lap portion was over Child 1’s\nlap, and the seatbelt shoulder portion was placed behind Child 1’s car seat. Parent A\nsaid Child 1 was only being “held into the car by a lap belt”. Parent A said Staff Y\nsaid Child 1 had tried to get out of the car seat which was why she decided to put\nthe seatbelt over Child 1’s lap. Parent A said she proceeded to put the car seat in\ncorrectly to the car and ensured that Child 1 was appropriately buckled into the car\nseat once the visit was finished.\nStaff Y was interviewed via telephone on November 9, 2020. Staff Y said she\nhas been a Family Support Worker at Child and Family Services for about three\nyears however only does it on a part-time basis. Staff Y said she did transport Child\n1 for her visit on October 30, 2020. Staff Y said Child 1 is 2 years old and needs a\nforward-facing, 5-point harness car seat. Staff Y said the car seat she had gotten to\ntransport Child 1 seemed “confusing” to her and she “forgot” how to strap it in\nappropriately. Staff Y said she buckled Child 1 into the car seat and the placed the\nseatbelt from the car over top of Child 1 and the car seat. Staff Y said she did not\nthink to ask anyone for help or call her supervisor for support. Staff Y said Parent A\ndid come to the car to get Child 1 when they arrived at the visit and Parent A\nstrapped the car seat into the car for the transport back to the foster home.\n4",
