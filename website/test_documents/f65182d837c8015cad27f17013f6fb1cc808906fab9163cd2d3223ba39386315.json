    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• R400.12507 Medical, dental and mental health care: The agency was\nadvised obtaining the youth's signed refusal for health services prior to the\nyouth's medical/dental examination due date may aid it in compliance with\nthis rule.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans during this\nlicensing period. The first corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2024\nRenewal inspection where it received 22 rule violations, of which 14 were repeat\nviolations and that inspection resulted in the agency’s license being modified to a\nsecond provisional license. During this 2025 Renewal inspection 12 rule violation\nwere established. Eight of the 12 violations are repeat violations; 5 are repeats\nfrom 2024 and 6 repeats from 2023. The agency’s corrective action plan\ncompliance around the 8 is as follows: the number of individual cases cited\ndecreased in all except for 2 rule violations, where the number of individual cases\ncited increased from 2 of 8 to 4 of 8 for one rule; and from 1 of 1 to 5 of 6 related\nto the other rule violation.\nIt is noted that the agency has implemented this corrective action plan and has\nmade significant improvements related to rule compliance and staffing issues.\nThe agency continues to work with staff around policy and rule understanding and\nimproving compliance.\nThe second corrective action plan related to Special Investigation\n2024SIC0000001 where the intake was received on 10/1/2024. The complaint\nalleged that the director advised a supervisor to falsify information related to\nsibling contacts and that the director was not following the treatment foster care\ncontract. During the investigation the agency was found in violation of Act 116-\n722.120(C) related to providing accurate and truth information to the department.\nThe agency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan that was approved on\n3/27/2025. The agency has since completed that corrective action plan.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 6/20/2025. The chief\nadministrator (CA) reported on the prior year's violation and the steps it put in\nplace to achieve compliance, as well as indicated systematic factors that impacted",
    "compliance. Those factors included the length of time from employee separation\nto hiring and training a new staff; abrupt resignation and termination of staff and\nhow that results in the agency hiring and training cycle already being behind.\nAdditionally health insurance impacting timely medical and dental exams due to\nsometimes having to switch a primarily care provider for the child and at times an\ninability to get an appointment for the child prior to the needed exams due date,\nindependent living youths not cooperating with staff on ensuring completion of\ntheir medicals and dentals, and MISACWIS not factoring in a youth's medical\nrefusal form completions.\nThe CA indicated the agency did not accept very many cases during this\ninspection period due to staff turnover and an increased focus on caseload\ncompliance. Additionally, the CAP still has been successful with medical and\ndental completions with email reminders occurring; and that parent agency\ntreatment plan agreements are better tracked during monthly supervisions.\nStrengths the CA listed for the agency were that it has increased oversight on\ncaseload compliance; increased timeliness and completion of onboarding training;\nand has increased completion of annual evaluations. The areas of focus listed\nwas developing a 6-month check-in with new staff; and continuing to assess what\nwill be beneficial action steps around medical and dental completions; and parent\nagency treatment plan agreements.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency provided a copy of its 2025 annual budget; and September 2024,\n2024, independent financial audit. A review of this document did not show any\nareas of concern.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nIn addition to my discussion with the chief administrator, foster care/adoption\nprogram manager, licensing supervisor, independent living program manager and\nindependent living supervisor, and a foster care supervisor, I interviewed two\nfoster care workers and an adoption worker. Strengths reported included flexibility\nrelated to being able to work onsite after 5:00pm; support from the management\nteam and coworkers; and the agency’s awareness of it past mistakes and\nwillingness to make corrections. Areas of concerns listed included a belief that\nsome staff favoritism exists, receiving more individual appreciation and\nverbalization on how one is doing in their role. Also, the desire for the\ndevelopment of a master list of all report due dates (service plans, court reports,\nmedicals, dentals, etc.) monthly and for that list to be circulated to all staff to help\neveryone know what is coming due and to aid in monitoring.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nDuring a walkthrough of the facility no concerns were revealed. The agency’s\nrecords are securely stored, and there appears to be sufficient equipment for staff.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere was one identified safety alert.\nSafety Alert: No operable smoke detectors on each level of occupancy and or near\nall sleeping areas. The smoke detector on the upper level was beeping. The smoke\ndetector in the basement was beeping.\nResolution: On 5/2/2025 an agency worker visited the caregiver's home, another\nsmoke detector was provided to the family and installed where one was missing.\nThe family bought and installed batteries in the two smoke detectors that were\nbeeping. The worker verified the working order of the smoke detectors and provided\nphotos of the detectors.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nJuly10, 2025\n_____________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 11, 2025\n_____________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
