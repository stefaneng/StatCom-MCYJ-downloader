    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nA CAP, approved 5/3/23, was the result of the 4/27/23 Interim review. The agency\naddressed violations regarding special evaluations and independent living. During\nthe current review, it was determined the CAP was implemented successfully, as\nthere are no repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed on-site. The\nChief Administrator (CA) reported success with the 2023 CAP, and no further\nconcerns in those areas. The CA reported new processes were developed\nregarding special evaluations and independent living. Both of which seem to have\ncorrected the prior issue. The CA identified some disrupted/unplanned moves\nduring the past year, due to significant behavioral concerns of youth.\nHospitalization was required in many of those incidents. Other unplanned moves\nwere the result of youth committing a crime or violating probation, which resulted\nin placement in detention or residential. The CA reported the overall lack of\navailable foster homes has made it difficult to secure placements. The agency\ncontinues to develop strategies to overcome barriers to licensure.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed, one licensing worker and one foster care worker. Both\nstaff reported they enjoy their positions and feel supported by their supervisor and\nadministration. Neither staff had any concerns nor identified areas for\nimprovement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same county building as previous\nyears. The office provides secure storage for confidential information, and\nadequate space for staff and clients.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL analyst identified two safety concerns as follows:\nSafety Alert 1: On 10/13/23 an unlicensed relative caregiver had a wood burning\npellet stove in the kitchen without any safety guards to protect the 18mo toddler.\nResolution: Agency staff met to discuss the findings. The licensing worker\ncontacted the caregiver and identified the solution to place a gate around the wood\nstove. The caregiver agreed to always supervise the child near the stove. A photo of\nthe installed gate was provided to the agency on 10/20/23 and verified during a visit\non 10/23/23.\nSafety Alert 2: On 10/30/23 it was determined the home needed a CO2 detector.\nResolution: On 10/31/12 the caregiver provided the agency with a video of the\ninstalled CO2 detector. The child’s adoption worker visited the home on 11/3/23 and\nverified the CO2 detector was installed and working.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ _________February 29, 2024________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 5, 2024\n_____________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
