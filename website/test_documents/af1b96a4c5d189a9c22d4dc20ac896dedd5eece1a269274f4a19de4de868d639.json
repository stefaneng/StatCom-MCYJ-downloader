DCWL\nConsultant received an email from DCWL Analyst on May 12, 2021. The email stated\nchild caring institutions (CCIs) cannot hire without receipt of the CWL-1326 Licensing\nRecord Clearance Request Child Caring Institutions Staff form. The CWL-1326 form\ndocuments that state based clearances have been completed and that DCWL has\nmade the request to corresponding states for abuse/neglect and that DCWL has made\na request for criminal history in the Intellicorp system. The email stated those two things\nrequire that the CCI provide DCWL General Office Assistant with the necessary\nreleases to make these requests. DCWL General Office Assistant was completing\n2",
    "follow up on a new hire tracking spreadsheet when she was informed by Mott Children’s\nResidence that they already hired Staff 2, although she had not released the CWL-1326\nform back to them.\nI interviewed DCWL Analyst via telephone on May 12, 2021. She confirmed what was\nstated in the email she sent to DCWL Consultant on May 12, 2021. DCWL Analyst\nstated Mott Children’s Residence hired Staff 2 prior to receiving the CWL-1326 form\nfrom DCWL. She reported the out-of-state child abuse and neglect clearance request\nwas not made to the corresponding states because Mott Children’s Residence did not\nreturn the clearance authorization forms with Staff 2’s signature to DCWL so that the\nrequests could be made. She reported DCWL General Office Assistant would have any\ncorrespondence that she had with Mott Children’s Residence regarding the clearance\nforms.\nI interviewed the Director of Human Resources and Agency Operations via telephone\non May 13, 2021. She stated she believes Staff 1 submitted all of the required\ndocuments to DCWL to have the out-of-state clearances completed, however, DCWL\nhad not returned the CWL-1326 form back to Staff 1.\nI received and reviewed emails from DCWL General Office Assistant on May 13, 2021.\nShe emailed Staff 1 on March 2, 2021 regarding the need for Staff 2 to sign\nauthorization forms to request child abuse and neglect clearances from Colorado and\nArkansas. DCWL General Office Assistant emailed Staff 1 on May 11, 2021 asking if\nthey still intended to hire Staff 2 as DCWL had some outstanding out-of-state central\nregistry clearance checks. Staff 1 responded that Staff 2 had been hired and she\nattached the results from the Arkansas central registry. Staff 1 indicated that she had\nnot received the CWL-1326 for Staff 2 from DCWL.\nI received and reviewed emails from the Director of Human Resources and Agency\nOperations on May 13, 2021. She stated Staff 2 started his employment on March 21,\n2021 and was terminated on May 12, 2021 for unrelated reasons. She attached\ndocuments pertaining to Staff 2’s written statement regarding his offense in Colorado,\nthe written evaluation of the offense, the CWL-1326 which was forwarded to DCWL on\nFebruary 26, 2021, his Michigan central registry results, his criminal history results, his\nMichigan public sex offender registry results, his Dru Sjodin national sex offender\nresults, his American Checked nationwide criminal background results, the Colorado\ncentral registry request which was forwarded with payment on March 5, 2021, the\nArkansas central registry request which was forwarded March 1, 2021 and the results\nwhich were received on March 1, 2021.\nThe Director of Human Resources and Agency Operations sent a second email to me\non May 13, 2021. The correspondence between Staff 1 and DCWL General Office\nAssistant was attached to the email. The Director of Human Resources and Agency\nOperations stated after reading through documents, she sees the step that was missed.\nShe stated Staff 1 received the forms to send to the two states, she received the\nrequired signatures and sent them but failed to send a copy back to DCWL which would\n3",
    "have prompted them to process the CWL-1326 and forward it back. She reported\nmoving forward, Staff 1 understands this process now. She stated she had Staff 1\ncomplete an internal audit and she was able to confirm that they do have the CWL-\n1326's back from DCWL for all other employees at the agency.\nI completed the pre-exit conference of preliminary findings with Director of Human\nResources and Agency Operations via telephone on June 8, 2021. I explained the\nprocess on how the clearances have to be completed for new hires. The Director of\nHuman Resources and Agency Operations stated Mott Children’s Residence complete\ncriminal history clearances and child abuse and neglect clearances in addition to the\nclearances that DCWL completes.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(1) Child caring institutions subject to 42 USC 671 shall not\npermit a child caring institution staff member to begin\nworking unless all of the following has been completed\nusing the forms, and in the manner, prescribed by the\ndepartment:\n(a) A criminal record check as referenced in R\n400.4113(f), including a fingerprint based check of national\ncrime information databases, unless an alternative criminal\nhistory check has been approved by the federal\ngovernment.\n(b) A check of Michigan's child abuse and neglect\ncentral registry or Canadian provincial agency as\nreferenced in R 400.4113(i).
