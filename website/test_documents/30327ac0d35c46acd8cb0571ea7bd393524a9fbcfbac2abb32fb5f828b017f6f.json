    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency interim inspection was completed on 11/20/24, with the CAP\napproved on 1/3/25. The agency was cited regarding special evaluatons and\nadoption family evaluations. The agency reported successful implementation of\nthe CAP. However, the agency noted ongoing difficulty completing timely adoption\nevaluations, due to applicants not completing requirements within the timeframes\ngiven. This was evident in one repeat violation found for the 2025 review.\nTechnical Assistance was provided to the agency regarding this rule.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator (CA) assessment dated 6/4/2025 was reviewed on-site.\nThe CA reported the agency was able to implement the CAP from the 2024 review\nwith success, except for difficulty completing adoptive family evaluations timely.\nThe agency was provided with TA in that area, as well as recent policy update that\nshould help improve compliance over the next review period. Regarding disrupted\nplacements, the agency reported five unplanned moves. Four youth were removed\nfrom an unlicensed relative placement due to substantiated concerns by DHHS.\nOne youth moved from an unlicensed relative placement, due to the relative\npassing away unexpectedly. The CA reported the agency has grown over the past\nyear and accepted several new cases, which resulted in hiring new staff.\nHowever, maintaining stable staffing continues to be struggling at times. The CA\nreported the agency has received a grant from the Michigan Health Endowment\nFund, for projects to proactively address recruitment and retention of child welfare\nstaff. The agency reported systemic challenges that make foster care work\ndifficult. Challenges include a lack of adequate mental health service availability,\nlack of affordable housing for clients, court inefficiencies causing adoption delays,\nand expectations of court which are outside of the scope of typical foster care\nwork. However, the agency continues to maintain a high level of performance,\ndue to the dedication of long-time staff and leadership. The agency consistently\nmaintains Key Performance Indicators at 95-100%.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted the 12/31/24 financial audit and 2025 budget for review. No\nfinancial concerns were noted.",
    "Staff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. One staff reported being with the agency for\nless than a year. They stated their experience has been great and they had an\nexcellent support system. The staff said they have learned a lot from everyone at\nthe agency and feel they are able to easily communicate with supervisors and\nadministrative staff. The second staff had been with the agency for over a year.\nThe staff stated they felt very supported, recognized, seen and heard. Staff stated\ntheir supervisor was the best one they ever had and provides a level of support\nnever received in previous jobs. Staff stated that the job can be stressful at times,\nbut administration is good at recognizing this and showing appreciation. Neither\nstaff had concerns or suggestions of improvements.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as in previous years.\nThe office has ample space for staff and clients. There is sufficient meeting and\nvisitation space. The office has locked storage for files and confidential\ninformation.\nVII. AGENCY ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert #1: During a visit on 4/4/25, the relative caregiver’s home was missing\nsmoke detectors in the basement, 1st and 2nd floors.
