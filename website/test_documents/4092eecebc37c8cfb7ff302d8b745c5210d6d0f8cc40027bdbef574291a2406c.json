    "One of twenty-eight PATPs had late signatures by the foster parent and mother.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10/7/2020 INTERIM, CAP APPROVED 10/29/2020. Previously cited as 722-08C\n7/27/2021 RENEWAL, CAP APPROVED 8/6/2021. Previously cited as 722-08C\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n FTM reports (1105) must be entered into MiSACWIS within seven business day\nof the meeting.\n When a Team Decision Meeting is held, it must be entered into MiSACWIS under\nthe FTM tab. The DHHS 5966 must be completed and uploaded in lieu of an\n1105.\n A closing DHHS-69 must be completed and uploaded to MiSACWIS within three\ndays of receiving the court order to close the case.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility requested consultation regarding DHHS offices changing to paperless\nsystems and how that will impact closed adoption files that must be submitted to\nDHHS at the 12–13-month mark, with closed foster care files. Policy office has been\ncontacted for clarification. Information will be shared with the agency when it is\nreceived.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were two incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nA special evaluation was initiated on 12/14/21 due to allegations that a foster parent\nhit a child. The investigation concluded the foster parent “tapped” the child’s head. A\nviolation of rule 9404 Behavior Management was cited, and a CAP was developed.\nThe foster parents completed training regarding oppositional defiance & control,\nregulation through hard parenting moments, and what behavior is and how to\nchange it. The CAP was completed 5/23/22. However, the agency continues to\nmonitor the foster home and provide support as needed.\nA special evaluation was initiated on 6/2/22 due to multiple allegations. A violation of\nrule 9404 Behavior Management was cited due to findings the foster parent hit the\nchild’s wrist. A CAP was developed which included training regarding the behavior\nmanagement policy, opposition defiance & control, regulation through hard\nparenting, and what behavior is and how to change it. The CAP was completed on\n5",
    "8/10/22.\nOverall, the agency completed these special evaluations in compliance with\nlicensing rules. Findings and CAPs were found to be appropriate and consistent with\nthe information obtained during the evaluations.\nThe agency has submitted three acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nA CAP, approve 8/6/21 was the result of the 7/27/21 renewal evaluation. The agency\nwas cited for the following contract/policy items: late case contact entry and late\ntreatment plan signatures. During this review, the agency has one repeat violation\nregarding late PATP signatures. However, the number of late signatures has\nimproved significantly over the past year, which indicates the agency’s CAP has\nbeen effectively implemented.\nA CAP, approved 7/14/22, was the result of the 6/28/22 special investigation\n(2022C021216). The investigation was initiated due to an allegation the agency did\nnot submit closed adoption files to DHHS within the required timeframe. The agency\nwas found in violation of policy ADM 2030. A CAP was developed to better track\nclosed adoption case files and their due dates to DHHS at the 12–13-month mark\nafter closure. CAP monitoring is ongoing.\nA CAP, approved 3/16/22, was the result of the 3/2/22 special investigation\n(2022C0212005).The investigation was initiated due to an allegation that a case\nworker left two youth unattended in a vehicle and another worker “dragged” a child.\nThe agency was found in violation of rule 206, Staff qualifications. The agency\ncompleted the CAP by reviewing the incident with staff and providing feedback,\ncompleting several trainings, providing shadowing/coaching to the staff, and utilizing\nincreased supervision. There are no further concerns in this area at this time.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed on-site.\nThe CAA reported successful CAP implementation from the prior review period.\nCompliance was established by increased verbal and calendar reminders, quarterly\ncase reviews, and time management planning for staff to complete required tasks.\nAdministration also participated in a Quality Improvement project with DHHS in\nJanuary 2022 regarding barriers and best practices.\nThe agency reported having difficulties with staffing this past year. After some staff\nleft the agency there was an insufficient number of applicants to interview to fill open\npositions. Staff and supervisor reported feeling stressed over the increased workload\nwhen there were vacant positions. Which resulted in the agency’s decision to\ndecrease the number of new cases they would accept. The agency also reported\nstressors such as fingerprinting delays, court closures, barriers to permanency in\ncases, COVID restrictions, limited treatment and support services in the area, and a\nlack of communication and accountability from professional partners. All of these\nissues have caused strain and struggle over the past year. However, the agency\n6",
    "continues to move forward, hire additional staff, and make changes as needed to\nhelp staff through this time.\nInterviews\nThree agency staff were interviewed on-site, from various departments. All staff\nreported the agency as being a very good place to work. Supervisors are\nknowledgeable, helpful, and able to provide guidance as needed. Agency\nadministration is open and supportive. Although it was acknowledged this past year\nwas difficult in some ways, none of the staff had concerns or identified areas the\nagency could improve.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules, MISEP requirements, or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n_ ____________September 20, 2022______________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 21, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
