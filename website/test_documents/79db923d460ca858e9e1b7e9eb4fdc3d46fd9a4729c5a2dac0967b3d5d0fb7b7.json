Even if the foster\nparent corrects the issue while the analyst is on-site.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request or require consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nOne CAP was required as a result of the 11/22/24 Interim review. The CAP was\napproved 12/10/24. The agency was cited regarding borrowed homes, late service\nplans, missing independent living agreements, and required documents at the\nclosure of a case. The CA reported the agency successfully implemented their\n2024 CAP. As a result, the agency violations decreased from nine in 2024, to five\nin 2025. During the current renewal evaluation, two repeat violations were found\nregarding service plan timeliness, and IL agreements.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) Assessment dated 8/19/25 was reviewed and\ndiscussed. The CA reported challenges this year including staff turnover and a\ndecrease of quality service providers in the area. Despite these challenges, the\nagency continues to function well and maintain compliance in most areas,\nimproving compliance in several areas from the 2024 CAP. The CA reported\nfrequent review of the CAP and action steps positively impacted their compliance.\nThe agency reported eight disrupted placements during this review period. Four\nwere due to foster parent request, three short term emergency placement, and\none youth moved to residential.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency's 2025 budget and 12/31/24 financial audit were reviewed. No\nfinancial concerns were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed on-site. One staff had been with the agency for over a\nyear and the other staff had been with the agency for less than six months. Both\nstaff stated they enjoyed their positions with the agency and felt it was a great\nplace to work. Both staff noted they were currently lacking a program manager",
    "and supervisor, which meant the agency director was supervising them in addition\nto her other duties. Staff stated they were aware of the director’s many\nresponsibilities but felt that she did a great job supporting staff and staying on top\nof everything. Neither staff had any concerns or suggestions for improvement for\nthe agency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2024 review. The\noffice had sufficient work and meeting space for staff, visitation space for families,\nand secure storage for files and confidential information.\nVII. AGENCY ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were three identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert 1: During the 6/16/25 visit, the analyst observed the family's pool did\nnot have a self-closing/self-latching gate.\nResolution 1: The agency contacted the family on 6/17/25. On 6/20/25 the agency\nprovided a photo of the newly installed self-latching hardware. On 7/16/25 the family\ninstalled self-closing hardware. Photos were provided to DCWL to verify resolution.\nSafety Alert 2: During the 6/24/25 visit, the analyst observed the family had guns\nstored in a locked wooden cabinet with a glass front. Due to the glass front, the guns\nneeded to be trigger locked.\nResolution 2: The agency provided trigger locks for all guns stored in the glass\ncase. Photos were provided to DCWL as verification.\nSafety Alert 3: During the 7/2/24 visit, the analyst noted there was not a safety plan\nfor the family pool.\nResolution 3: On 7/7/25 the agency developed a safety plan and reviewed it with\nthe family. A copy of the plan was provided to DCWL as verification.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. A corrective action plan is required.\n_ ____________August 25, 2025________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 27, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager"
