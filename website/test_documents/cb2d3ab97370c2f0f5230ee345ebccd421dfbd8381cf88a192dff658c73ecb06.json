INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Supervision.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12505\nSection (1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in independent\nDescription living consistent with the youth's need for supervision, as required\nby R 400.12504(2)(e).\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1: Two youths in the home are selling drugs to two\nother youths, who have special needs (one youth is pregnant in a\n2",
    "wheelchair and the other has seizures). The administrator is\naware of this and not acting on it.\nAllegation 2: Social Worker 1, Chief Administrator 1 and staff do\nnot stop fights from happening at the facility.\nInvestigation Allegation 1\nInterviews:\nComplainant X\nOn 1/19/2023 I interviewed Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X reported living at the Our House program from\nSeptember of 2022 until July of 2023. Complainant X mainly\nreported indirect information related to the allegations. She\nreported knowing things by way of her continued contact with\ncurrent and prior youths of Our House. She reported knowing\nwhich youths live at the facility, that youths at the facility are\nselling marijuana, but she was unsure who was buying the drugs.\nShe reported knowing one of the youth drugs are being sold to is\npregnant and in a wheelchair; and another has seizures. She said\nwhen she lived at the facility Youth G gave her marijuana. She\nreported this occurred sometime during the winter of 2022.\nComplainant X reported Youth G was also either selling or giving\nmarijuana to other youths in the house. She said she knew about\nthis because another youth (Complainant X did not identify that\nyouth) would share the marijuana with her and that youth told her\nthe marijuana was from Youth G. Complainant X did not report\nrelaying this information to the Our House staff.\nComplainant X reported she was also told that Youth D is selling\ncocaine and Xanax. Complainant X admitted she never witnessed\nsuch action by any youth when she lived there. Additionally, she\nreported Youth C uses weed and vapes; and that he and other\nyouths (no other additional youth named) sell drugs. She reported\nknowing Chief Administrator 1 and Social Worker 2 are aware of\nyouths using and selling drugs because they caught her smoking\nmarijuana once when she lived there, and they had walked in on\nother youths smoking marijuana in their rooms; or had smelled the\ndrug coming from the youth’s room.\nI asked Complainant X what staff did when the youths were\ncaught using or having drugs. Complainant X reported there are\nconsequences for the behavior. The staff take away the marijuana\nor vape, and there is a week house restriction. She reported one\ncan also get kicked out of the program for continue use of\nsubstances because it’s a violation of the facility rules, but that the\nfacility gives youths lots of chances. Complainant X reported at\nleast one youth had been kicked out of the program, but she\nadded that this youth had other additional house rule offenses.\n3",
    "She reported Youth XY used to live at the facility and may have\ninformation about who was selling drugs at the house.\nYouth XY\nOn 1/29/2024 I interviewed Youth XY by telephone. Youth XY\nreported living at the facility from April 2022 until October 2023.\nHe reported only knowing that Youth G would sell marijuana in the\ncommunity, never at the facility. He denied ever witnessing Youth\nG, or any youth giving or selling marijuana to Youth A or Youth B.\nYouth XY reported, though he never witnessed it, he knew of\nYouth G giving marijuana to Youth C. He said he knew that\nbecause Youth C and Youth G got caught with it. Also, because\nhe had smelled marijuana when Youth C, Youth F and Youth G\nwere in Youth C’s room. He said the staff knew of youth using\ndrugs, because the staff had caught them with marijuana and\nedibles. He said catching youth with those items was an ongoing\nissue. Staff would tell the youth not to use drugs, that if they did\nso in the community there wasn’t anything they could do about\nthat, but to not use it in the house. Staff would do room checks,\nand if they smelled it or found it they would talk with the youth,\ntake the substance and would put the youth on restriction. Youth\nXY did not know whether the staff reported any of those incidents\nto the youth’s worker or sought out substance abuse services if\nthe youth needed them. Youth XY said he does not do drugs, so\nhe could only speculate that the staff may have done those things.\nHe reported knowledge of Youth J, and that Youth J was kicked\nout of the program, but he did not know if it was for drug use or if\nYouth J was doing other things.\nChief Administrator 1\nOn 1/24/2024 and 1/26/2024 I spoke with Chief Administrator (CA)\n1 about the complaint allegations by telephone. She reported\nsome of their youths have substance issues. Therefore, some\nthings in the complaint may technically be true, in that they have\ncaught youths smoking marijuana in their rooms or with drug\nparaphernalia. She reported she is not aware of any youths\nselling marijuana, Xanax or cocaine to any youths. Nor had any\nyouth or staff reported such allegation to her. She reported it is\nnot true that they do not supervise their youths or that they allow\nor condone drug use. She reported it is an independent living\nprogram and they have limited control on what a youth does every\nhour of the day. Staff supervises the youths from 4:00pm-8:00am.\nThey report concerns when they discover them and address those\nconcerns with the youth. CA 1 said they provide ongoing support\nand supervision to the youths. They conduct random room checks\nin an attempt to keep drugs out the house and dissuade drug use.\n4",
    "If they catch a youth smoking/using marijuana or in possession of\ndrugs on the premises they talk with the youth about their\nbehavior and the rules, ask for the items, and get the youth’s\nworker or counselor involved by way of reporting or scheduling a\nTDM (Team Decision meeting) or FTM (Family Team Meeting) if\nnecessary.\nCA 1 advised current youths, Youth E, Youth D, and Youth C as\nwell as past youth, Youth G, had been caught smoking marijuana\nin their rooms in the past. Youth E was also caught in possession\nof a vape pen. She reported it had also been rumored by one\nyouth that Youth G was getting or selling marijuana in the\ncommunity, but that was never confirmed by the youth. Nor\nsomething the agency staff ever witnessed or had knowledge of.\nCA 1 further advised that Youth C and Youth E have substance\nissues. Youth E is in treatment, and when he was caught with a\nvape pen within the last month, the item was confiscated, his\ncounselor and worker were contacted and a TDM is pending. CA\n1 reported Youth C is transitionally out of the program, and\nalthough they had suspected him of using, when they caught him\nit was the first time he was caught using. They talked him about\nhis behavior and were trying to get him to agree to work with his\ncounselor. They also reached out to his tribal social worker.\nCA 1 reported as it relates to allegation pertaining to Youth D, who\nis relatively new to Our House, Youth D was connected to Xanax,\nbut not for selling it, or selling cocaine. Youth D’s connection to\nXanax came to the agency’s attention as her possibly giving pills\nto another youth (Youth H who was discharged from the program\nin July 2023) who reportedly tried to hurt herself by taking pills.\nYouth D knew the milligrams of the of the pills Youth H had taken\nand Xanax were found in Youth H’s system. However, a search of\nthe youths rooms by staff did not discovery any Xanax or pills. CA\n1 surmised that the youth who made this current complaint is a\npast youth making the allegation up about the Xanax being sold.\nCA 1 reported Youth D was also caught twice using marijuana. At\nthe time of the incidents, the marijuana was taken, and house\nrules were re-discussed with Youth D. A TDM referral was also\ncompleted and a substance abuse intake referral via Community\nMental Health (CMH) was completed for Youth D.\nAs for the cocaine allegation, CA 1 reported having no idea as to\nwhere that allegation originated, as no youth has ever reported\nsuch a thing. She reported there had been a rumor last year that\nYouth J, (a prior youth of Our House) was offered and smoked\n5",
    "crack once while in the community but that incident was never\nreported directly to the staff or confirmed.\nCA 1 denied Youth A or Youth B reporting any youths giving or\nselling them drugs. CA 1 said Youth B does not smoke marijuana.\nYouth B was in treatment in the past, and since the summer of\n2023, Youth B has done well. Youth B never reported purchasing\nmarijuana, or other drugs from anyone in the house. As for Youth\nA, Youth A is pregnant, does use a wheelchair, has a TBI\n(Traumatic Brain Injury) and other issues. Youth A denied any\nrecent drug use. CA 1 did not know if Youth A ever brought\nmarijuana in the house for use. CA 1 indicated the staff never\nfound anything. CA 1 reported once Youth A is ready for\ndischarge, Youth A will not be returning to Our House. Youth A will\nneed 24-hour care due to Youth A’s stress, high need pregnancy,\nand other issues.\nSocial Worker 2\nOn 1/22/2024 I spoke with Social Worker (SW) 2 about the\ncomplaint allegations by telephone. Another interview occurred\nwith SW 2 at the Our House’s administrative office on 1/29/2024.\nSW 2 is the assigned case worker for all the youths placed in the\nOur House home. Those youths (are all age 18, except Youth D)\nare:\n• Youth A who is hospitalized and cannot have visitors)\nplaced at Our House on 3/30/2023.\n• Youth B placed at Our House on 3/29/2023.\n• Youth C placed at Our House on 10/21/2022.\n• Youth D placed at Our House on 11/27/2023.\n• Youth E placed at Our House on 10/20/23.\n• Youth F placed at Our House on 4/20/2023.\nSW 2 affirmed that Youth G is a past Our House youth. Youth G\nvisits the house once or twice a month; because he dates Youth\nF. Youth G is never allowed to stay over. SW 2 denied knowledge\nof any youth selling marijuana to another, but reported there was a\ntime during staff room checks that marijuana was found in Youth\nA, Youth C and Youth D’s room. Staff has also caught Youth C\nand Youth D either using marijuana, or with marijuana or vapes,\n“lots of vapes” in their rooms. SW 2 reported room checks are\nconducted often, perhaps three times a month. The room checks\nare situational, conducted by staff, when someone smells the\nsubstance, it’s use is directly reported by someone, or staff gets a\ntip about such. SW 2 reported all youths are provided the house\npolicy against drug use/ it being on the property and are aware of\nthe possible room checks. She reported when a youth is caught\n6",
    "using or with items, they confiscate the items, have a TDM about\nthe incident and the youth is placed on restriction, whereby, they\nare limited in their access from the house without a staff until such\ntime that a TDM is held with the department. She reported there\nare levels of reaction/consequences that occur about an incident.\nOn a first occurrence/offense, it would result in her being\ncontacted; and her having a discussion with the youth about\nhis/her/their behavior/the situation. On a second and or third\noccurrence that would result in a meeting with her and CA 1.\nThereon, if there are more occurrences, the department monitor\nwould be involved in a TDM. They also document the incidents.\nShe reported with Youth C, he was involved in court order\ntherapy, which included addressing substance and drug screens,\nbut Youth C had only complied once.\nYouths and Staff\nOn 1/29/2024 I interviewed Youth B, Youth C, Youth D and Youth\nE onsite at the Our House independent living home. I also\ninterviewed Staff 3, and Staff 4 onsite on this date. I was unable to\ninterview Youth A.\n• Youth A was unable to be interviewed by me. Youth A\nwas hospitalized and on bed and visitor restriction during\nthe course of this investigation.\n• Youth C reported living in the independent living (IL) home\nfor one year and two months. He reported there are no\npeople in the house giving or selling marijuana to another.\nHe reported if any youth wants marijuana that person can\nget it off the street. He said pretty much every youth has\ngotten caught with marijuana at least once; inclusive of\nhimself recently. He said staff may be too nice around\ngiving youth too many chances, but staff do not allow any\nyouth to smoke or use drugs in the house. Staff talks to\nthem about not using drugs and following the rule. Staff do\nroom checks monthly and usually finds marijuana or\nsmoking devices. He said if caught in violation of the\nhouse rules, there is a consequence for it, like restriction\nand their worker will get contacted. He thinks staff should\nbe stricter, though admitted if a youth continues to violate\nthe rules the youth can get terminated from the program.\nYouth C denied knowing any youth who sold or may have\nsold Xanax or cocaine to any youth. He admitted hearing a\nrumor about someone selling Xanax but denied knowing\nwho that could be.\n7",
    "• Youth B reported living in the IL home for 10 months. She\nsaid she used to smoke weed, but she has been sober for\nfive-six months now. She reported there are youth in the\nhome using things like weed, Percocet, Adderall and\nXanax, but no one has given it to her or tried to sell it to\nher. She said things like that may go on in the house, but\nstaff can’t catch everything. She said staff have found all\nkinds of things in youths room, but mostly weed. She\nreported there was one youth (whose name she would not\ndisclose) had Xanax and flushed them down the toilet after\na youth was taken to the hospital and it was discovered the\nyouth had taken Xanax. Youth B reported no one forces\nanother youth to use or smoke drugs, or to buy weed or\nother substances. That if the other person wanted to use\nthe drug they would. She reported the staff may not\nalways follow up on what may be happening when the staff\nsmell weed, or when she has reported an issue. She\nacknowledged not knowing whether the staff may have\nfollowed up later. She said other youth and staff reported\nstaff finding paraphernalia during periodical room\nsearches. Youth B was not sure if those searches were\nconnected to staff having smelled marijuana. She admitted\nyouths are given consequences for breaking the house\nrules about using drugs on the premises.\nYouth B reported most of the time the youths in the home\nare just using substances to get high not because they\nhave a drug problem. She did not know if staff have tried to\nhelp youths to obtain substance treatment by referral or\nhad contact with others related to the youth’s behavior but\nreported the staff did do so with her. They helped her with\na therapy referral and treatment.\n• Youth D reported living in the IL house for two months.\nShe also denied any knowledge of any staff allowing any\nyouths to openly use drugs. She confirmed what other\nyouths reported about confiscation of drug paraphernalia\nitems and youth consequences. She also reported\neveryone in the program may have an issue with drug use\nand the staff tries to help them. She reported if staff think\nyou are using drugs or they find marijuana or\nparaphernalia in a youth’s room, the agency conducts a\nTDM, and safety plan, by asking if this is the right place for\nthe youth. She reported knowing this because it happened\nwith her. She reported speaking with CA 1 and SW 2,\n8",
    "having a TDM with her and her worker, and they placed\nher on restriction as opposed to kicking her out, after\nYouth H (who is no longer in the program) accused her of\nselling Youth H narcotics. Youth D said that allegation\nagainst her was false, that she never had Xanax.\nYouth D reported knowing Youth G, but only in the context\nof him visiting and hanging out with Youth F at the house\nthree times. She denied any awareness of Youth G or any\nyouths in the house selling drugs to Youth A, Youth B or\nany other youths. She said Youth A keeps to herself and\nhas her own way of getting drugs.\n• Youth E reported living in the IL home for three month. He\ndenied any knowledge of any youth selling or trying to sell\nmarijuana, Xanax or cocaine to him or any youth in the\nhome. He said he keeps to himself and did not want to say\nwhether he uses drugs or not. He reported if staff catches\na youth using any drugs or with weed, the staff will talk\nwith the youth. He was not aware of any youth being\nterminated from the house due to drug use but indicated it\ncould be possible.\n• Staff 3 and Staff 4 both reported the IL home being\nstaffed 16 hours per day, 4:00 PM to 8:00 am and\nconfirmed the information reported by CA 1 and SW 2\nrelated to what happens if drug use occurs onsite or is\nreported or suspected. Both staff reported weed and vapes\nare things they have found often because of their follow up\nafter smelling it. Both of the staff reported if any referral for\ntreatment is needed SW 2 or CA 1 would be responsible\nfor that.\nAdditionally, neither Staff 3 or Staff 4 reported any\nawareness of Youth G, Youth C or any other youth selling\ndrugs to Youth A, Youth B or any other youths. Staff 3\nreported she would find it hard to believe that Youth G was\nselling drugs to the youths, because when Youth G was\nliving in the home, Youth G basically followed the rules.\nStaff 3 said they would find weed in Youth B’s room earlier\non, but not recently. And as for Youth C there have been\nsuspicion of him using, but nothing found.\nBoth Staff 3 and Staff 4 advised that Youth G discharged\nfrom the program during the summer, and currently Youth\nG visits Youth F at the home. Staff 3 and Staff 4 reported\n9",
    "knowledge of an incident involving Youth H and Xanax,\nbecause of an initial reporting by Youth D that Youth H had\ntaken the substance. They indicated it was suspected that\nYouth D had given pills to Youth H, but there was no real\nevidence of that. Xanax was never found with Youth D or\nin her room.\nStaff 5\nI interviewed Staff 5 by telephone phone on 2/2/2024. She\nconfirmed information reported by other staff related to Youth G\nand Youth D. She reported they try to crack down on youth who\nmay bring marijuana or other substances in to the house. She said\nYouth C has been caught using weed, but not selling it. Nor was\nshe aware of Youth B using it, or Youth G giving or selling it to\nyouths. If Youth G had or they suspected him of such, Youth G\nwould not be allowed on the premises. She said when others\nreport a youth as having substances or they smell it they address\nit in the moment. They have the youth turn it over. If the youth\nwon’t comply they document that. She reported the leadership\nstaff, SW 2 and CA 1 are notified in each incident. She was not\naware whether substance abuse assessment had been utilized\nwith any youths after these incidents, but TDMs had been\ndiscussed as well as the use of consequences for not complying\nwith house rules. Level of consequence are gradual, and depend\non the incident, or number of them.\nAdult Care Worker Y\nI had communication with ACW Y by email on 2/2/2024. ACW Y\nreported a brief interview with Youth A who had her grandma on\nthe phone per Youth A’s request. ACW Y was unable to obtain\nspecific information from Youth A about the allegations. Youth A\nreported feeling safe around everyone at the house.\nReviewed\nCase record for Youth A, Youth B, Youth C and Youth D which\nshowed:\n• The youth’s date of placement at Our House as 3/30/2023;\n3/29/2023; 10/21/2022; and 11/27/2023 respectively\n• Social work contacts showing contact with case monitors\nabout the youth’s progress or lack thereof in the program.\n• Contact with Youth C’s counselor related to substances\nbeing found in his room; and an FTM was held.\n• Social work contact with Youth D’s case monitor and a\n1/9/2024 referral to CMH.\n10",
    "• Case documentation in Youth B’s most recent service plan\nfor 11/7/2023-2/7/2023 denoting she has been sober for a\nfew months.\nOur House Program Statement which indicated:\n• Supervision: Our House will have on-site staff 16 hours a\nday, 7-days a week. Our House maintains an on-call phone\nwhere participants may call 24-hours, 7-days a week in\ncase they need a staff member.\nOur House Search policy which indicated:\n• Our House reserves the right to search rooms randomly,\nregularly, and will search if suspicion of contraband is\nindicated.\nOur House Code of conduct Policy which indicated:\n• Possession of illegal substances, weapons or other\ncontraband are unacceptable and prohibited behavior while\na youth is engaged in Our House activities. Having such\nitems would result in a warning and/or disciplinary action\nincluding suspension or termination from participation in\nOur House programs.\nOur House Mosaic Alcohol/Drugs/ Tobacco/Firearms Policy which\nindicated:\n• It is the policy of Our House to prohibit and discourage the\nuse of drugs, alcohol, and firearms; and that house\nparticipants are prohibited from using drugs or alcohol or\npossessing firearms while engaged in all Our House\nprograms.

    "Allegation 2:\nInterviews:\nComplainant X\nOn 1/19/2023 I interviewed Complainant X, a prior Our House\nyouth by telephone. Complainant X reported staff at the facility do\nnot break up fights. Complainant X reported knowing this\nbecause of an incident she experienced there and because of an\nincident involving another prior youth, Youth XY. Complainant X\nreported when she lived at the facility an older youth there (she\ndid not disclose who that was) threatened to beat her up. The\nyouth told her they would get in her face. Complainant X said she\ntold that youth they would not get in her face; and the staff (whom\nComplainant X could not recall) didn’t do anything when the\nincident was happening. Conversely, Complainant X\nacknowledged that the staff told the other youth to stop what they\nwere doing. Complainant X expressed that the other youth did not\nstop their behavior and staff never called the police. Complainant\nX admitted the youth never attacked her; and that the two of them\nnever entered into a physical fight.\nComplainant X said Youth XY could speak to this allegation\nbecause he was attacked with pots and pans by Youth B and\nYouth J when Youth XY lived at the facility. Complainant X said\nshe didn’t witness that incident, Youth XY told her it happened.\nYouth XY did not report any physical injuries from the incident, but\nhe was emotional about it. Youth XY told her what the staff did\nduring/about the incident.\nYouth XY\nOn 1/29/2024 I interviewed Youth XY about this allegation by\ntelephone. He reported there had been times that fights had\noccurred when he resided at the facility. During those times he\nsaid staff could not intervene physically because Our House it not\na hands-on facility, meaning they could not physically restrain\nyouths. He indicated the staff would try to get the youths to stop\nany aggressive behaviors and if they would not staff would call the\npolice. He admitted there had been a physical incident involving\nhim and Youth J but he did not recall the time frame of that\nincident. He said Youth J tried to put him in a choke hold, the staff\ntold Youth J to stop, Youth J did not, Youth XY said he defended\nhimself then the staff called the police about the fight, and that\nwas it.\nChief Administrator 1\n12",
    "On 1/26/2024 I spoke with Chief Administrator (CA)1 about the\ncomplaint allegation by telephone. CA 1 denied the allegation.\nShe reported staff talk with youths when conflicts are happening.\nShe reported the agency encourages resolution and does not\nallow or condone fights. Police intervention is utilized when\nwarranted.\nSocial Worker 2\nI interviewed Social Worker (SW) 2 about the complaint matter at\nthe Our House’s administrative office on 1/29/2024. SW 2 also\ndenied the allegation and affirmed CA 1’s indication about staff not\ncondoning or allowing youth to fight. She reported an awareness\nof two physical alterations occurring at the house. The first\naltercation was in the late summer of 2023 and involved prior\nyouths, Youth XY and Youth J whereby the police were called.\nThe two youths had been arguing back and forth on and off this\nday. Staff had deescalated those incidents and had instructed\nboth youth to stay away from one another. Later that afternoon,\nYouth XY became more agitated and got into another verbal\naltercation with Youth J. Staff stood in between the two youths\nand tried to get Youth J outside to have him calm down. As the\nstaff tried to usher Youth J out the house, Youth XY followed and\nat some point Youth XY made derogatory remarks about Youth J\nsexual behavior and Youth J swung over the staff at Youth XY.\nPrior to everyone getting outside, Youth J was able to retrieve a\nfrying pan from a nearby box of donations and threw it at Youth\nXY. After they all were outside, Youth XY retrieved a chair from\nthe porch and threw at it Youth J. The chair hit Youth J on the\nthigh and left a bruise/cut. When the police arrived Youth J’s injury\nwas examined, and Youth XY was taken to the emergency for\npsychiatric care. The staff also took Youth J to the ER for follow\nup.\nThe second incident involved Youth X0. Youth X0 threw a lamp in\nattempt to hit Youth B. The lamp hit the wall and Youth X0\nattacked Youth B. Youth X0 and Youth B were shouting at each\nother and Staff 6 (who is no longer employed with the agency)\nwas trying to calm them down. Staff 6 got in between the two\nyouths, and Staff 6 was the one who got hit. Youth B was not\ninjured, the police were called and Youth X0 was arrested. A 30-\nday discharge removal was put forth for Youth X0, because prior\nto this incident Youth X0 had swung a chair toward another youth.\nThe chair, believed by staff not really intended at hitting the other\nyouth, hit a staff. SW 2 reported in this later incident it did not\nbecome physical. The staff safety planned around the issue by\ntalking with both youths and the other youth left the house to stay\n13",
    "with a friend. SW 2 reported the staff always try to deescalates\nsituations, no one is allowed to just fight.\nYouth and Staff\nOn 1/29/2024 I interviewed Youth B, Youth C, Youth D and Youth\nE onsite at the Our House independent living home. I also\ninterviewed Staff 3, and Staff 4 onsite on this date. I was unable\nto interview Youth A.\n• Youth A was unable to be interviewed by me. She was\nhospitalized and on bed and visitor restriction during the\ncourse of this investigation.\n• Youth C reported staff don’t condone fighting, but no one\nhas gotten kicked out for fights or arguments. He said staff\ndon’t want to threaten them to do right; staff want them to\nmake better choices and encourage them to make those\nchoices. He said he could not speak on Youth D, Youth XY\nand Youth J, He said staff tried to help them, but Youth XY\njust would not try to do right. Youth J did too much stuff and\nwas the only youth he knew that got kicked out of the\nprogram. He admitted there was a fight between Youth J\nand Youth XY, and the Staff 4 tried to break it up. He did\nnot recall the police being called then but said staff have\ncalled the police when altercations have occurred. They\ndon’t just do nothing.\n• Youth B reported when youths are arguing staff will\nsometimes try to stop it, but most of the time staff will call\nthe police. When she was attacked by Youth X0 staff\nintervened and called the police. Youth X0 was then\narrested. Also, when another youth was yelling and\nthreatening her, staff told the other youth to stop. The youth\ndid not stop. The incident went on for several minutes.\nYouth B said that incident ended when she walked away.\n• Youth D denied witnessing any fights. She reported\nsometimes the staff may put too much attention on one\nthing (Youth D did not elaborate on what she meant by\nthat) but staff do not let arguments between youths\nescalate. Staff try to calm everyone down.\n• Youth E denied an awareness of any youth fights or\narguments. He reported keeping to himself and not being\ninvolved in any arguments or fights. He believes if there\nwere arguments or fights that staff would try to stop them.\n14",
    "• Staff 3 reported when youth argue or fight, they either try to\nseparate the individuals, or they have the youth go to\nanother room. They encourage youths to use coping skills\nto handle their problems. There has never been a time\nwhere staff has not intervened when there was a fight.\nShe said there may be a time when there is a safety risk\nfactor and they may have to step aside and get police\ninvolved, but they don’t just do nothing. She said since the\nyouths do not see all the paper work involved in what they\ndo, a youth may think certain youths may not get penalized\nfor their wrong or inappropriate action, but staff do try to go\nto bat for youths. Staff 3 reported being present for an\nincident involving Youth X0 and Youth F. Youth X0 was\ndoing the bullying and the two youths were exchanging\nwords. Youth X0 was emotionally heated while Youth F\nwas trying to control herself. Staff 3 tried to deescalate the\nsituation when Youth X0 sort of whipped a chair around\nand the chair hit Staff 3’s leg. Staff 3 did not report a need\nto call the police in that incident but reported they do call\nthe police as a last resort if they can’t calm the situation.\n• Staff 4 reported similarly as Staff 3 related to interventions\nand consequences for youths related to physical conflicts.\nShe said that they try to know the youths placed in the\nhome, to know the youths triggers so that they can provide\nthe supports needed. They try to calm argumentative\nsituations down, to decrease escalations, and will place\nthemselves between the youths to talk with them, to\nencourage them to walk away. She said, physical fights\ncan be tricky. That they as staff can’t physically intervene,\nand sometimes it comes down to them getting police\nintervention.\nStaff 5\nI interviewed Staff 5 by telephone on 2/2/2024. She did not recall\na physical altercation between youths since her employment with\nthe agency on 10/6/2023. She reported there had been some\ncyber-bullying and in person arguing, and they verbally defuse the\nsituation by talking with the youths. She said the staff is very\nresponsive when they learn about conflicts.\nAdult Care Worker Y\nI had communication with ACW Y by email on 2/2/2024. ACW Y\nreported a brief interview with Youth A who had her grandma on\nthe phone per Youth A’s request. ACW Y was unable to obtain\n15",
    "specific information from Youth A about the allegations. Youth A\nreported feeling safe around everyone at the house.\nReviewed\n• Incident reports related to a physical altercation between\nYouth J and Youth X0, on 9/22/2023, which described the\nincident that occurred basically as reported by SW 2. The\nincident report showed that staff intervened.\n• Our House incident letter on 7/27/2023 related to Youth X0\ninvolvement in throwing a vase and lampshade at a youth\non one occasion and swinging a chair at or toward another\nyouth on another occasion. Additionally, the agency’s 30-\nday notice for Youth X0 due to her behavior and having to\ninvolve the police in resolution of one of the incidents.\nAnalysis The staff and IL youths interviewed denied the allegations as\nbeing true. The evidence showed staff discouraged drug use and\nphysical altercations/conflicts. The staff supervises, encourages\nand works with youths, and services workers/counselors or\nreferral services as needed related to the youth.\nThere is insufficient evidence to support a lack of supervision by\nstaff.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the facility’s current licensing status is recommended.\n3/18/2024\n__________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n4/5/24\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n16"
