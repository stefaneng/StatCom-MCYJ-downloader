    "Rule Code Policy and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12202\nSection (1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures for all the areas of foster care services as provided in\nR400.12203 to R 400.12214.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation For months there have been home visits in the caregiver's home\nand no home visit sheets have been completed or signed.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 9/19/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone. She\nconfirmed the information alleged in the complaint. She reported\nhome visit sheets are used by the agency workers related to\nrecording visits to the foster homes and the agency has not\ncompleted them with her home in four or five months. She said\nwhen workers visit they do not see the children alone or asks to\nsee the children bedrooms.\nChief Administrator\nOn 9/24/2024 I interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) by telephone.\nCA reported it has been the agency’s practice for over 14 years to\ncomplete home visits sheets for home visits. She reported workers\nare required and expected to complete these sheets with the\nfoster parents/caregivers on monthly home visits. She reported\nwith the number of worker turnovers in recent years, this\nexpectation may have been impacted. She reported home visit\nsheets are not uploaded to MISACWIS but are kept in the child’s\nhard file. She was not certain as to whether home visit sheets\nexisted related to all monthly home visits for Child A’s and Child\nB’s case which this complaint relates. She reported speaking with\nthe children’s foster parent, Parent C, on a number of occasions\nand Foster Parent C did not report home visit sheets as a\nconcern.\nCA reported there were performance issues with Child A and\nChild B’s prior worker, Foster Care Worker (FCW) 2, and given\nthe worker changes, she suspected home visit sheets might have\nbeen lacking. After checking on this matter, the CA provided\ncopies of two home visit sheets and acknowledged there were\nonly two completed in 2024. She reported FCW 1, and Foster\nSupervisor (FCS) covered this case after FCW 2 was let go, and\nFCS is covering the case now.\n2",
    "Foster Care Worker 1 (FCW)\nOn 10/9/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone. She reported only\nbeing assigned to Child A and Child B’s case for one month, from\nJuly to August of this year. She reported going to the foster home\nthree to four times. She denied not seeing the children’s\nbedrooms or not talking with them alone. She said only one of her\nhome visits was a monthly home visit, requiring a home visit\nsheet. The other visits would have been for parent/child visits,\nwhich took place via zoom at the foster home with her supervising.\nShe was not certain as to whether she had completed a home visit\nsheet for the monthly home visit she completed on this case,\nwhich she surmised would have been an August 2024 monthly\nfoster home visit. As for the parent/child visits she conducted FCW\nreported Foster Parent C was aware no home visit sheets were\nrequired for those.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 10/9/2024 I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS reported\nChild A and Child B’s case has been with the agency since 2020,\nbut the agency had the case prior in 2017 also. She said she was\nonly the supervisor on this case for about one month from\n7/22/2024 to sometime in August 2024. She confirmed\ninformation reported by FCW 1 related to her visit. FCS reported\nprior to the July date the case was covered by FCW 2, who is no\nlonger with the agency, and the case was supervised by CA. She\nsaid she began covering the case as the worker after Foster\nParent C continued to complain about the case and requested a\nworker change. FCS said she completed a foster home visit in\nSeptember 2024, and she completed a home visit sheet. She said\nFCW 1 would not have completed a home visit for September\n2024. As for FCW 2’s home visit sheets. FCS reported not being\naware of those home visit sheets, that they are not documented,\nand not in the children’s hard file. Nor are they to be stored there.\nReviewed\nChild A and Child B’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Child A is a temporary court ward who was placed in his\ncurrent foster home on 9/22/2021.\n• Monthly home visits occurred from 1/31/2024 2024 to\n9/20/2024. And with the exception of a lack of detail about\nthe foster home visits on 6/15/2024 and 5/31/2024, home\nvisits show Child A and Child B were seen alone, and all\nbut those two showed the children’s rooms were viewed.\nThree foster home visit sheets provided by CA related to home\nvisits for Child A and Child B in Foster Parent C’s home for\n3",
    "8/2/2024 and 9/20/2024. The latter, not the former show the foster\nparent’s signature on the form. The 8/2/2024 sheet/home visit was\ndocumented by FCW 1 and listed both Child A and Child B name\non the form. The 9/20/2024 home visits/ sheets were documented\nby FCS, and one was for Child A and one for Child B respectively.\nAn additional home visit sheet for 10/4/2024 provided from and\ncompleted by FCS for both children, and signed by Foster Parent\nC.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nsupports a lack of compliance to the agency’s home visit sheet\ndocumentation policy and violation of this rule.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code Staff responsibilities.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(b) Facilitating services and parenting time for children for\npurposes of reunification.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The worker has not put in referrals for the biological parent’s\nservices.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 9/19/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone. She\nconfirmed the information alleged in the complaint. She reported\nthe agency denied services to Child A’s birth father and did not\nfollow up with him for DNA testing. She reported the agency’s lack\nof timely work to get services for the birth father has impacted the\npermanency for both children. She said Foster Parent C asked for\nFCW 1 to be taken off the children’s case, and the agency\nreplaced her with FCS. Foster Parent C has also asked to get\nFCS taken off the case, but the agency won’t do it. She said the\nagency is a mess on services. She said she has met with the\nprogram director related to concerns, but CA has not met with her.\nChief Administrator (CA)\n4",
    "On 9/24/2024 I interviewed CA by telephone. CA reported FCW 1\nand FCS are the only two staff who have had the case since mid-\nJuly 2024. She said FCW 2 reported she had completed the\nreferrals on the biological parent back in April 2024. She said\nFCW 2 also told Foster Parent C she had completed the referrals.\nCA said they found out later that was not true, the referral was not\ncompleted, and so they took action to try to get the services. CA\nsaid there was a problem with referrals since the dad lived in\nGenesee County. Also, for a significant time prior, the court had\ndelayed services for the dad, and getting the court order had been\na problem. She reported their agency is only responsible for\nservices to dad who is the parent to Child A.\nCA reported there was not any physical documentation for\nreferrals for the children’s father because he resides in Genessee\ncounty. She was going to have FCS write an email that detailed\ndates, types of contacts (phone or emails) and person’s spoken\nto, and for what services, and provide that to me related to this\nmatter. That documentation was provided by FCS on 10/14/2024\nand is listed in the review section.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 10/9/2024 I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone. FCW 1 reported\nduring her short time on this case from July to August 2024 she\nsolicited services for the birth father. She said the birth father\nneeded drug screens and anger management. She said she\nstarted random drug screens on him on 8/6/2024. She reported\nsince the birth father resides in Genessee County a regular\nJuvenile Assessment Center (JAC) referral through Wayne\nCounty was not doable. She said she obtained a referral source\nfrom the agency’s quality specialist, and she emailed that source\nin Genesee County in an attempt to get the birth father registered\nfor services She said no one reached back out to her before the\ncase was transferred from her but she informed FCS of her email\nto that referral source.\nIn terms of a psychological referral for the birth father, FCW 1\nreported she spoke with the birth father about this at the end of\nJuly 2024 and on 8/30/2024. The birth father told her in July he\nalready had an appointment scheduled for the psychological\nassessment for 8/16/2024. She said on 8/14/2024 she asked the\nbirth father via text whether that appointment was still set for\n8/16/2024. The birth father told her it was. When she spoke with\nthe birth father by telephone on 8/30/2024, he said he kept the\nintake appointment on 8/16/2024 and an official first appointment\nwas pending for 9/5/2024. FCW 1 was not sure whether the birth\n5",
    "father kept the 9/5/2024 appointment. She said she had no further\nknowledge of the case after its reassignment from her.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 10/9/2024 I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS reported\nFoster Parent C reported FCW 2 did not do things on the\nchildren’s case. Foster Parent C reported the birth father needed\nto be referred for services, but nothing specific. FCS reported\nFoster Parent C’s concern about this case is that Foster Parent C\nbadly wants to adopt Child A and Child B.\nFCS said FCW 2 never completed the referral for services for the\nbirth father, which would have been ordered before her\nassignment to the case. She affirmed information reported by\nFCW 1 as to services needed for the birth father. She also\nreported the birth father actually did not follow through on that\npsychological evaluation appointment. She said the last court\norder from the hearing she attended on 9/27/2024 ordered a\npsychological assessment. She said on 9/18/2024, she followed\nup on FCW 1’s email requesting assistance with referring the birth\nfather for services in Genesee County, and no one has followed\nup with her. She reported at this point, the agency is seeking to\nobtain services for him via the JAC to see if they will service him\nvirtually.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nChild A and Child B’s MISACWIS case record which showed\ninformation as listed prior in this report, and parenting times for the\nbirth father.\nCourt Orders dating back to 2/26/2024 showing services for the\nbirth parents were to include a psychological evaluations, drug\nand alcohol testing, anger management and parenting time.\nA copy of an 8/24/2024 email from FCW to a service provider\nindicating she has an order for a parent in need of anger\nmanagement services and would they please instruct her on how\nto get this parent enrolled.\nA copy of a 9/24/2024 email from FCS to a service provider\nreaching out to register the birth father for parenting classes and\nanger management and asking for assistance with the referral\nprocess.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed, though they are currently seeking to secure specific\n6",
    "services for the birth father now, the agency did not timely act to\nrefer, obtain, and facilitate those services for the birth father as\npreviously ordered by the court.\nConclusion Violation Established.\nRule Code Development of service plans.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12418\nSection (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or parents and the\nDescription foster parents in the development of service plans to enable the\nparent or parents and foster parents to understand the plan for the\nchild and the parents' and the foster parent's role in assisting the\nagency in carrying out the plan. An agency shall give a copy to\nand review the parent-agency treatment plan with the parent or\nparents and foster parents. The agency must inform the parent or\nparents and foster parent that the information in the parent-agency\ntreatment plan and any other information about the child and the\nchild's family is confidential.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The case worker has let parent agency treatment plan\nagreements (PATPA) lapse.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 9/19/2024 I interviewed Complainant by telephone. She\nconfirmed the information alleged in the complaint. She said she\nhas only seen one PATPA (Parent Agency Treatment Plan\nAgreement) in six months.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 9/24/2024 I interviewed CA by telephone. CA reported this\nallegation to be accurate, but that the foster parent had never\nmentioned a lack of PATPAs as a concern. CA reported at the\ntime that FCS assumed case responsibility for the children’s case,\nFCW 2 had left service plans and PATPAs undone. She said the\nagency had been working to get these service plans up to date\nsince November 2023. She said the last report ended September\n2024.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 10/9/2024 I interviewed FCW 1 by telephone. She reported\ncompleting one updated service plan during the month she was\nassigned the children’s case. She said the service plan was one\nmonth past due when she got the case. She said she never got a\n7",
    "PATPA signed by foster parent, because the service plan was not\napproved prior to her being taken off the case.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 10/9/2024 I interviewed FCS by telephone. FCS reported\nwhen she audited the case there was a service plan pending for\napproval. She said the updated service plans (USP) for\n12/5/2023-3/3/2024, 3/4/2024-6/1/2024 and 6/2/2024-8/30/2024\nwere completed, but were late. She said no USP came due while\nshe was assigned the case, but the one approved by the CA on\n8/30/2024 and prior she received the foster parent’s signature on\n9/20/2024.\nReviewed\nChild A and Child B’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• USP 9/6/2023-12/4/2023 was completed on 1/9/2024 and\napproved by CA in MISACWIS on 6/20/2024.
