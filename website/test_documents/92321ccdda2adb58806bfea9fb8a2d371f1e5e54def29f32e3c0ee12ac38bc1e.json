Youth G is no longer in the program. There was no\nanswer.\nAdditional Findings:\nIn the course of the investigation, Youth H wrote a grievance\nconcerning Staff 3 reporting he spoke unprofessional to the\nyouth.\nStaff 3 reported he has never spoken unprofessionally to Youth H.\nStaff 3 reported he has never used profanity towards Youth H.\nStaff 3 reported that he always has to redirect Youth H because\nYouth H questions staff often.\nYouth H was interviewed on 10/21/25.

Staff 6 reported he sometimes brings his frustrations\nfrom home to work, but overall, he is a good staff. Staff 6 reported\nhe did not tell anyone because the situation was handled and\ndiffused by talking to youth and staff. Staff 6 reported there were\nno other incidents so they continued with their shift. Staff 6\nreported if it rose to abuse or neglect he would report this, but felt\nthat it was taken care of.\n6",
    "Documents Reviewed:\n• Staff 1 personnel file. Staff 1’s central registry was dated\n12/20/24, training was in compliance and did have topics\npertaining to communication and verbal de-escalation. Staff\n1 did not have discipline in her file.\n• Staff 3 personnel file. Staff 3’s central registry was\ncompleted on 2/24/25. Staff completed all training required\nwhich included, communication and verbal de-escalation.\nStaff 3 has discipline in his file:\no 7/11/2019: Sleeping while on shift; one day\nsuspension without pay\no 10/5/2023: Improper conduct; Staff 3 used abusive\nlanguage and received a written reprimand\no 8/19/2024: Verbal or physical abuse; Staff name\ncalled a resident and used an inappropriate racial\nslur towards a youth.\n• Grievances from Youth A, Youth B, and Youth H.\nGrievances were in agreement with their interviews.\nAnalysis The agency is non-compliant with this rule. Staff and youth\nreported Staff 1 has mocked youth by mimicking Youth A’s stutter,\nmaking inappropriate comments concerning the boys fighting like\nthe girls, which resulted in the escalation of Youth A, and ridiculing\nYouth G’s Walk. Staff 3 has, in frustration, told the youth to “shut\nthe fuck up.”\nTechnical Assistance:\nStaff 3 had two other disciplinary actions pertaining to misconduct\nand verbal abuse in his file within the last two years. The agency\nwill need to provide more than training to ensure Staff 3 does not\ncontinue to supervise children in this manner. Additional\nsupervision, possible mentorship, specific employee goals,\ntraining to aid in those goals and monitoring may be used to\nprovide further employee assistance.\nNeither Staff 4 nor Staff 6 reported this information to their\nsupervisors. Both felt like they handled the situation at the time of\nthe incident. Currently there is not a policy that is directly related\nto this. The agency will need to address this in a policy. It is the\nresponsibility of all staff to provide for the continual needs,\nprotection and supervision of residents. By not reporting this to the\nsupervisor on duty or direct supervisor, staff are unable to be\nproperly trained or corrected to conform to the milieu of the\nagency.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n7",
