    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327 Special evaluation\nSection (5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an agency\nDescription shall complete a written report that includes all of the following\ninformation:\n(e) Conclusions regarding licensing rules compliance or\nnoncompliance based on the findings of fact.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency did not recommend to the department the appropriate\nlicensing action consistent with facts contained in the foster\nhome's special evaluation.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 3/12/2025 I spoke with the Complainant about the allegation.\nComplainant reported the agency’s special evaluation outcome\nshould have resulted in noncompliance based on the special\nevaluation narrative information, but it did not. Complainant\nreported that the worker indicated no additional findings.\nComplainant indicated the inappropriate findings related to rules\nwas noticed by the DCWL (Division of Child Welfare Licensing)\nwhen a placement exception request, from the agency was being\nreviewed by DCWL. Complainant had nothing further to add\nrelated to the allegation.\nOn 3/12/2025 I had an email correspondence with the Chief\nAdministrator (CA) about the complaint allegation. CA directed\nme to the Foster Care Program Manager to speak with about this\nmatter.\nOn 3/17/2025 I interviewed Foster Care Program Manager\n(FCPM) by telephone. FCPM reported that the agency does not\nget foster parent complaints very often. She reported she does\nnot sign off or have involvement related to the special evaluation\nunless it was a very unusual situation. FCPM did not report this\nfoster parent’s special evaluation falling into that unusual situation\ncategory. She reported having no concerns with how Licensing\nWorker (LW) and Licensing Supervisor (LS) go about completing\nspecial evaluations. She had no concerns about how LW and LS\ncompleted the special evaluation for Foster Parent 1 and Foster\nParent 2 or their findings.\nOn 3/26/2025 I interviewed the Licensing Supervisor (LS) by\ntelephone. LS reported this complaint allegation against the\nagency only came out because the agency asked for a placement\nexception to be able to place another child in Foster Parent 1’s\n2",
    "and Foster Parent 2’s foster home; after Youth A went AWOL from\nhome and refused to return. LS reported the special evaluation\ninvestigation on this foster home was conducted with Michigan\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Law\nEnforcement (LE). LS reported DHHS had no findings and LE\ndenied things reported by Youth A. She reported Youth A was the\nonly person interviewed whose story changed related to the\nreported allegations. LS reported Youth A had stated he was\ngoing to say and do anything he could to get removed from Foster\nParent 1’s and Foster Parent 2’s home. LS reported the foster\nparents had done everything they could to care for Youth A. She\nreported though it was true Foster Parent 1 threw the camera item\nmentioned in the complaint; Foster Parent 1 threw the camera in\nfrustration. Foster Parent 1 did not intentionally throw the camera\nat Youth A. She reported based on their investigation; the agency\ndid not assess that a foster home licensing rule violation was\nwarranted. She reported, since some training for foster parents\nhad come up in discussion with the licensing worker, the agency\nsuggested Trauma and Community Reintegration training for the\nfoster parents. She reported these training were suggestions not\nmentioned as a requirement or mandate.\nI interviewed Licensing Worker(LW) by telephone on 4/1/2025.\nLW reported the special evaluation on the foster home was\nconducted quite some time ago, June or July of last year; and she\nstands by her findings. She reported she interviewed everyone,\nand everyone’s stories matched except Youth A’s. Youth A’s\naccount of what happened was the only one that was inconsistent\nand kept changing. LW reported a statement similarly to LS’s\nrelated to what Foster Parent 1 did with respect to the camera,\nthat the foster parent threw the camera on the ground in\nfrustration. The foster parent did not throw the camera at Youth A.\nLW reported “those cameras are expense”; and that “there is no\nrule violation for frustration”. LW reported what happened during\nthe incident did not rise to the level of a citation for inappropriate\ndiscipline and no non-compliance was indicated.\nDocument Reviewed:\nThe agency Special Evaluation report for Foster Parent 1 and\nFoster Parent 2 completed by LW on 7/26/2024 and signed by LS\non 7/29/2024. The report indicated the following related to the\nallegations, persons interviewed as it related to the allegations:\n• On 6/24/2024 at 10:40 PM law enforcement was called to\nthe home regarding a physical assault between Foster\nParent 1 and Youth A. The foster parent and youth argued\n3",
    "about a camera that was placed directly outside Youth A’s\nroom. Youth A unplugged the camera and placed it into the\nsump pump. When Foster Parent 1 looked for the camera\nhe was unable to find it. He asked Youth A about it and\nYouth A retrieved it and gave the damaged camera to\nFoster Parent 1. Foster Parent 1 threw the camera at Youth\nA striking him in the groin. Youth A then shoved Foster\nParent 1 into a door causing a red mark to Foster Parent\n1’s hand; and Foster Parent 1 called the police. Youth A\nwas not injured and there was no arrest.\n• Foster Parent 1 admitted to throwing the camera. Foster\nParent reported the cameras are expensive, that this was\nthe third or fourth camera that Youth A had destroyed, and\nso in frustration he threw the camera, and the camera\nmade contact with Youth A. Foster Parent 1 was unsure\nwhether the camera hit the ground before hitting Youth A or\njust hit Youth A. Foster Parent reported Youth A then\npushed him into the doorframe of the basement causing\nhim to receive a cut to his hand. Foster Parent 1 reported\nYouth B was the only youth to witness the incident that\noccurred; because Youth C and Youth D were in their\nroom; and Youth E was asleep.\n• Youth C, and Youth D did not witness the incident; and\nYouth F could not be interviewed due to his age.\n• Youth A reported not liking his home and wanting to leave,\nwanting to go live with his biological grandmother and\nsister. Youth A reported believing Foster Parent 1 had been\nplacing cameras facing his room and so he confronted him.\nYouth alleged Foster Parent 1 got in his face and balled his\nfist up. Youth A admitted to unplug the cameras in the past;\nand in this instance putting the camera in water so it would\nnot work. Youth A reported he did not mean to throw the\ncamera in the water; it just went in. He reported\nimmediately afterwards, he grabbed the camera and gave\nthe camera to Foster Parent 1. He reported Foster Parent 1\nthrew the camera at him; it hit him in the groin area; and he\npushed Foster Parent 1. He reported Youth B was there,\nwitnessed the incident, and Foster Parent 1 called the\npolice. Youth A also alleged in this interview that Foster\nParent 1 had gotten in his face, and punched him in the\npast, and that when he has hit Foster Parent 1 back, Foster\nParent 1 calls the police.\n• Foster Parent 2 reported he was in the shower at the time\nof the incident. Foster Parent 2 stated Youth B told him\nYouth A hit Foster Parent 1, and he told Youth B to call\n911. Foster Parent 2 said Foster Parent 1 told him Foster\n4",
    "Parent 1 threw the camera and thought the camera hit the\nground and then hit Youth A. Foster Parent 2 reported\nwhen Youth A escalates the family calls 911. Foster Parent\n2 reported Youth A did not tell him he was injured from the\nevent.\n• Youth B reported Youth A came out of a room in the\nbasement holding a wet camera. Youth A handed the\ncamera to Foster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 1 threw the\ncamera. The camera hit Youth A on his upper thigh/genitals\nand then bounced onto the floor. Youth A then pushed\nFoster Parent 1 into the door and the police were called.\nYouth B reported he was there and witnessed the event.\nDHHS’s investigative report with respect to the event\nallegations:\n• The outcome of the DHHS interviews with Foster Parent\n1, Foster Parent 2, Youth A, Youth B, Youth C.\n• Youth C, and Youth D did not witness the incident.\n• Foster Parent 1’s, Foster Parent 2’s, Youth A’s (aside\nfrom some profanity language by him), and Youth B’s\ninterview statement was similar to the information\nindicated in the agency’s special evaluation report.\n• Youth E was not interviewed.\n• Law Enforcement interviews with Foster Parent 1, Youth\nA, Youth B and Youth C which showed each person’s\ninterview statement about the event allegation to be\nsimilar to what was reported in this DHHS investigative\nreport and the agency’s special evaluation report.\n• No disciplinary findings.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and document review, the evidence showed\nduring an event dispute with the adopted youth over camera use/\nplacement/displacement or destruction, Foster Parent 1,\nnotwithstanding any frustration on his part, threw a camera which\ncaused that camera to hit the adopted youth.\nThe special evaluation report showed that aforementioned\ninformation, a rule citation to the foster home was warranted but\nnot indicated in the special evaluation. The licensing action was\nnot consistent with facts contained in the special evaluation and\non this evidence, the agency is found in noncompliance for this\nrule.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\n5",
    "Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent license status is recommended.\nApril 24, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 25, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"

    "summary": "The investigation found that Jackson County DHHS failed to properly evaluate a foster home incident where a foster parent threw a camera that struck an adopted youth during a dispute, leading to a physical altercation. The agency's special evaluation report documented the facts, including the foster parent admitting to throwing the camera, but incorrectly concluded no licensing rule violation had occurred, despite the evidence warranting a citation. The agency is held culpable for noncompliance due to its failure to recommend appropriate licensing action consistent with the documented facts.",
