INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Placement\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12404\nSection • (2) Initial consideration must be given to placement with a\nDescription relative or placing siblings together, or both.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Foster youth was moved from a relative placement and placed in\nan unrelated foster home rather than with another willing relative.\nThere are concerns regarding placement preservation and\nplacement decisions by the agency.\nInvestigation Maternal Aunt (Complainant) was interviewed via Microsoft\nTeams on 5/30/2024. She reported a detailed synopsis with dates\nof the alleged allegation and what occurred with her, the Kalkaska\nDHHS staff and Youth A. She reports Youth A was placed in her\nhome on 5/13/2024. She stated Foster Care Worker (FCW)\ncontacted her for the first time to touch base about Youth A on\n5/14/2024. The Maternal Aunt said on 5/15/2024, FCW contacted\nher around 7:00am to set up a home visit to talk with her regarding\nYouth A and to complete paperwork. She said on the same day\nshe texted FCW and stated to her she was not sure she was a\ngood fit for Youth A to be placed in her home because she has\nnever taken care of a child before and he was a hand full. She\nsaid she and FCW discussed other options for Youth A to be\nplaced. The Maternal Aunt said later on that day, FCW called her\nand said the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)\nhad found Youth A another placement and to have Youth A ready\nto leave her home the next morning. The Maternal Aunt said she\ntold FCW she was having a hard time and was seeking some help\nor assistance with Youth A, and she had changed her mind and\ndecided she wanted to keep Youth A.\nThe Maternal Aunt stated on 5/16/2024, she met with FCW at her\nhome to discuss Youth A’s placement and finding a foster home\nwilling to take Youth A if the Maternal Aunt changes her mind\nabout keeping Youth A down the road. Maternal Aunt said she\nwas informed by the FCW she needed to be sure if she wanted to\nkeep Youth A in her home because he is her nephew and Youth A\nwas in a relative placement. Maternal Aunt said she told FCW\nthat she will let her know her decision of keeping Youth A in her\nhome by the end of that week to determine how his behaviors\n2",
    "were and if she could handle him. Maternal Aunt said FCW told\nher to schedule a doctor and dentist appointment within 30 days\nfor Youth A and informed her that a scheduled appointment with\nCommunity Mental Health (CMH) had already been scheduled.\nMaternal Aunt said she received a text message from FCW\ninforming her that Youth A had an appointment on 5/17/2024 at\n11:20am in Kalkaska and if the time and date did not work for the\nMaternal Aunt, to let FCW know. Maternal Aunt said she told\nFCW she had already scheduled a doctor and dentist appointment\nfor Youth A in June 2024, and she preferred Youth A go to a\npediatric office she felt was more appropriate. She said FCW\ntexted her and said unfortunately, the appointment for Youth A at\nCMH had already been scheduled and Youth A needed to be\nready to go at 10:00am the next morning. Maternal Aunt said she\nfelt DHHS was rude with such short notice of the appointment for\nYouth A and was bulling her to agree with them regarding the\nCMH appointment. Maternal Aunt said no one asked her if she\nwas available for that day.\nMaternal Aunt said it was an unpleasant discussion between her\nand FCW because she was not going to have Youth A ready the\nnext day for the appointment DHHS had scheduled. She said\nFCW worker told her Youth A was under DHHS jurisdiction and\nshe could not withhold Youth A from his scheduled appointments.\nShe said she told FCW she had already scheduled Youth A’s\nappointments and she was not going to be available on 5/17/2024\nto take him to appointments DHHS had scheduled without getting\nher approval. Maternal Aunt said FCW texted her back and stated\nthat she (Maternal Aunt) was denying access to Youth A and she\nwas calling law enforcement to do a well-being check.\nMaternal Aunt stated Youth A was happy, healthy and thriving in\nher care. She said she received a telephone call from FCW’s\nsupervisor stating an emergency meeting was scheduled at\n2:00pm on 5/17/2024 by way of video chat. She said the Foster\nCare Supervisor called and had spoken with Youth A around\n10:00am that morning. She said after she spoke with Youth A,\nMaternal Aunt received an invite for another emergency meeting.\nMaternal Aunt said the Team Decision Making (TDM) meeting\noccurred; she voiced her opinion and DHHS voiced their opinion.\nShe said all agreed Youth A was going to remain in her care. She\nsaid she provided all of the medical dates and times for Youth A\nshe had scheduled. Maternal Aunt stated DHHS discussed how\nshe needs to have better communication with them and the TDM\nended.\n3",
    "Maternal Aunt said she talked with FCW on 5/20/24, to discuss\nhow the weekend went with Youth A. She said she told FCW she\ndid not feel comfortable with Youth A in her home, and she\nwanted to give Youth A the option to choose what Youth A wanted\nbecause she did not want Youth A to feel like she did not want\nhim. Maternal Aunt said a home visit was scheduled in her home\non 5/22/24 to discuss placement of Youth A.\nMaternal Aunt stated she texted FCW on 5/22/24 and told FCW\nthat something came up and she was cancelling the meeting\nbecause she was going up north to assist her grandmother with\nher aunt’s funeral, who had passed away. She said she received\na telephone call informing her that another emergency meeting\nwas being held on 5/23/24 at 11:00am, which she attended to\ndiscuss the breakdown of the communication barriers causing\nsafety concerns of Youth A and DHHS had found a placement for\nYouth A. She said she told FCW and Foster Care Supervisor at\nthe last meeting that she did nothing wrong, and this was “bull\ncrap” and Youth A was not going anywhere without a court order.\nShe said she left the meeting.\nMaternal Aunt said she received messages from multiple different\nagency workers and law enforcement threatening her and\ncharging her with kidnapping and withholding Youth A from the\nassigned foster care worker.\nMaternal Aunt said she informed everyone that called and texted\nher that Youth A was not in any danger, and she was dealing with\nthe death of her aunt which caused her to reschedule the days\nvisit and appointment for the next week. Maternal Aunt said there\nwas no issue with the judge’s court order provided to her by law\nenforcement saying she had to surrender Youth A and that Youth\nA was to be taken from her care. She said she and Youth A left\nher home and headed up north.\nMaternal Aunt said on Friday, 5/24/2024, while getting into her car\nfrom her aunt’s house up north, she was stopped by a police\nofficer and Youth A was taken into custody. She said she has\nheard nothing from anyone since and another one of her aunts is\nwilling to take Youth A, but DHHS did not consider this relative\nplacement.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) was interviewed via Microsoft\nTeams on 5/30/2024. Her account of dates regarding placement\nwith Youth A and his Maternal Aunt was slightly different from\n4",

She said about two days later\nMaternal Aunt called her and requested Youth A be moved from\nher home as soon as possible as she was overwhelmed with\nproviding for his care.\nThe FCW stated she went to Maternal Aunt’s home on 5/16/2024\nto complete an announced home visit with Maternal Aunt and\nYouth A. FCW said Maternal Aunt said at this time she would\nprefer for Youth A to remain in her care despite her previous\nrequest for a placement change. FCW said she informed\nMaternal Aunt to please let her know if she changes her mind\nabout the placement down the road. She said she and Maternal\nAunt discussed initial medical appointments for Youth A. She\nstated Maternal Aunt reported to her that she was unable to\nprovide transportation for Youth A’s initial medical appointments\nand requested DHHS schedule and provide transportation to\nthese appointments.

She said she also informed Maternal Aunt that in the future,\nshe could request gas cards for transportation and DHHS would\nprovide this to her.\nFCW stated she and the case aid exchanged several text\nmessages with Maternal Aunt informing her of the scheduled\nmedical appointment for Youth A regarding the date and time for\npick up. The FCW said the Maternal Aunt said she was unable to\ntransport Youth A to this appointment due to a lack of financial\nmeans for gas money. The FCW stated that she informed the\nMaternal Aunt that the department offers assistance with gas\ncards for transportation. The FCW said she informed the Maternal\nAunt that due to the appointment scheduled for 5/21/2024, the\ndepartment had arranged transportation for the doctor’s\nappointment for Youth A. FCW stated that the Maternal Aunt was\naware of the appointment and the arrangements by the\ndepartment.
