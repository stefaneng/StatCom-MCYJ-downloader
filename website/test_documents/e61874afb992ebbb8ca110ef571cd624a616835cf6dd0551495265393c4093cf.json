No new information was\nprovided.\nOn 4/30/24, I spoke to DHHS Worker 1. Allegations and\nscheduling were discussed.\nOn 4/30/24, I spoke to DHHS Worker 2. No new information was\nprovided.\nOn 4/30/24, I spoke to Administrator 1. Administrator 1 reported\nYouth A, Youth B, and Youth C went AWOL on 4/29/24.\nAdministrator 1 reported Staff 1 had followed the youth when they\nwent AWOL on 4/29/24 but did not come back with them. He\nstated the youth came back on their own and did not file any\ncomplaints or grievances. Administrator 1 reported he has not had\nany areas of concern for Staff 1 in the past.\nThe following interviews were conducted at the facility with\nDHHS Worker 1 on 4/30/24.\nYouth A\nYouth A reported he went AWOL with Youth B and Youth C on\n4/29/24. Youth A reported they were offsite (unknown area) and\nStaff 1 tried to run them over with his vehicle. Youth A reported\nthey (youth) were walking together, and Staff 1 was driving in his\n2",
    "jeep behind them. Youth A reported they were always walking in\nfront of the vehicle. Youth A reported Staff 1 said, “I’m gonna beat\nyou up and hit you with my car.” Youth A reported Staff 1 also told\nthem if they kept walking, Staff 1 was going to pull something out\nof his glovebox. Youth A reported Staff 1 was referring to a gun.\nYouth A was unable to provide why he thought this meant a gun.\nAfter stating this, Youth A then reported Youth B saw the gun.\nYouth A was asked how the gun was seen if they were walking in\nfront of the vehicle and he reported, “He just did.”\nYouth B\nYouth B reported he went AWOL with Youth A and Youth C on\n4/29/24. Youth B reported they left the facility grounds and went\noffsite. Youth B reported Staff 1 saw them and followed them in\nhis black jeep. Youth B reported Staff 1 didn’t say or do anything\nthat was inappropriate. Youth B then reported Youth C started to\npound his fists on Staff 1’s jeep and Staff 1 stated, “watch and see\nwhat I pull out of this glove box.” Youth B reported Staff 1 was\nreferring to his gun. When asked how he knew this, he stated he\nknew Staff 1 had a “black Glock 19.” Youth B reported they ran\nfrom Staff 1. Youth B reported later, they came back to the facility,\nwent into the cottage, and ate something. Youth B denied seeing\nthe gun.\nYouth C\nYouth C reported he went AWOL with Youth A and Youth B on\n4/29/24. Youth C reported Staff 1 saw him and attempted to help\nthem, but they would not listen and left the facility. Youth C\nreported Staff 1 followed them in his jeep. Youth C reported they\nstarted calling Staff 1 “bitch.” When they did this, Staff 1 yelled\nback, “You’re gonna see what’s in my front pouch.” Youth C\nreported Staff 1 was referring to a gun. When asked why he\nthought this, Youth C reported his dad has a gun and he has\nwatched videos where guns are to be placed in the vehicle. Youth\nC reported at one point the youth were walking and Staff 1 sped\nup and tried to hit them. Youth C reported Staff 1 came about six\nfeet behind them. Youth C reported Staff 1 didn’t say anything\nelse because it was raining that night, and his windows were up.\nStaff 1\nStaff 1 reported Youth A, Youth B, and Youth C were running\naround at the facility on 4/29/24 in the evening. Once he saw them\nleave the facility grounds, he went into his jeep and followed them.\nStaff 1 reported he followed them through neighborhoods and\nYouth B had cussed at him and Youth A was stating he was going\nto damage Staff 1’s car. Staff 1 reported he responded by telling\n3",
    "Youth A that he was following a “10-year-old and letting him lead.”\nStaff 1 was attempting to show Youth A he didn’t need to follow\nYouth B. Staff 1 reported the only other conversation he was\nattempting to have with the youth, was asking them to come back\nto the facility. Youth A continued to use profanity as he followed.\nStaff 1 reported they stopped at a house and because it was dark\noutside and him following three children in the dark, may look\nsuspicious, he went back to the facility. Staff 1 reported he was\nalways about 10-15 feet away from the youth. Staff 1 reported he\nwas always behind them. Staff 1 reported the youth were never\nclose enough to touch his car, except Youth A who came near his\ncar. Staff 1 reported Youth A did not punch his car or hit it to\ndamage it. Staff 1 reported when he stopped following them, he\nturned around in a grassy field and went to the facility. Staff 1\nreported he does have a Glock 22 caliber but does not bring this\nto work and has not discussed having one with the youth.\nAdministrator 1 reported they came back at 9:50pm.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• I reviewed the Incident Report dated 4/29/24. The incident\nreport states they went AWOL at 8:05pm; no return time\nnoted.\n• Staff 1 personnel file: There is no discipline in Staff 1’s\nfile. All clearances and training are up to date.\n• I reviewed their Behavior Management Policy which\nindicated threats of physical harm is a prohibited form of\nintervention.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate the allegations. All three-youth\nhad different accounts of the situation and all three youths’\naccounts were inconsistent.\nConsultation:\nConsultation was provided for all AWOL situations. Staff 1\nfollowed three youth at nighttime, in his own personal jeep. Staff 1\nhad followed them by himself. In the future, the agency may want\nstaff to use company vehicles and utilize more than one staff\nwhen searching and following AWOL youth. This will provide\nsafety for youth and staff.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n4",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n6/6/24\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
