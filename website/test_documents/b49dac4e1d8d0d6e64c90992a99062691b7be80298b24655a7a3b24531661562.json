    "was made for a copy of the medical policy and procedures for the\nagency.\nOn 09/25/2024 an interview was completed with Chief Program\nOfficer (CPO). A copy of the medical policy was provided. CPO\nwas advised of the allegations relative to the investigation. She\nconfirmed her knowledge that Youth A was not administered her\nmedication as the prescription had not been filled.\nThe following interviews were completed on 10/11/2024 at\nWhaley’s Mott, unless otherwise specified.\nCPO was interviewed. She reported prior to 9/1/24 her title was\nDirector of Clinical and Medical Services. She confirmed Youth A\nhad missed doses of her prescribed Clozapine. She reported that\ndocumentation showed her last lab draw occurred on 8/19/2024.\nCPO denied having a reason or knowledge of what led to the\nmissed medication for Youth A. She reported the Medical\nSupervisor position is currently vacant, and the medical staff are\nreporting to her. She reported the agency is looking to fill the\nposition soon and hope to hire a nurse for the position. She later\nconfirmed that Youth A had missed dosages of Clozapine in\nAugust 2024.\nYouth B was interviewed. She confirmed that she takes\nmedication two times per day. She reported that she goes to the\nmedical station in the morning for med pass. Youth B added that\nsometimes the medical staff give the medication to staff for them\nto pass it. She recalled there being a time when she did not\nreceive her medication. The house was on a bowling or skating\nevent and staff forgot to bring her medication for her evening\nmedication pass.

    "An interview was completed with Doctor. She confirmed that she\nwas the physician that prescribes the medication for Youth A. She\nrecalled that Youth A came to the facility already having been\nprescribed Clozapine (to treat schizophrenia and Hallucinations)\nand she continued it. Doctor stated she would not normally\nprescribe this medication because if it is not properly monitored, it\ncould present an issue for the patient up to and including death.\nShe stated Youth A came to the facility taking 500 mg per day\n(100 mg in the morning, 200 mg in the afternoon and 200 mg in\nthe evening). The dosage was reduced to 400 mg per day on\n08/12/2024 after it was reported that Youth A had not taken the\nmorning dosage for three days. Doctor stated she always thought\nthe dosage was really high and took this as an opportunity to see\nif the reduced dosage could be effective for Youth A. Doctor then\nbegan to prescribe 400 mg per day (200 mg in the afternoon and\n200 in the evening). On 9/16/2024 Doctor reported she was\ncalled and advised that Youth A had missed some of her doses.\nShe reported that Youth A took her last dose on Friday 9/13 at\n4pm. She denied that she was contacted prior to 9/16/24\nregarding the missed doses. Doctor further advised that when\ncomplete doses are missed, the patient has to restart the\nmedication at a lower dose (50 mg) and gradually increase all\nwhile doing weekly blood draws (increase from the monthly\nrequirement). She advised the blood draws are to monitor the\nwhite blood cell levels of the patient. Doctor reported in order to\nprescribe Clozapine physicians must have certification via REMS\n(Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). REMS is a drug safety\nprogram that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require\nfor certain medications with serious safety concerns to help\nensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks. Doctor\nreported that blood draws are required monthly and results are\nprovided to the prescribing physician and the pharmacy to upload\ninto REMS. If the results are not uploaded, the pharmacy is not\nable to dispense the medication to the patient. Doctor reported\nthat to her knowledge the REMS system, blood draws and refills\nwere up to date. Once informed of the missed doses, Doctor\nrestarted Youth A on the medication at 50 mg per day. As of now\nshe has increased to 150 mg per day (100 mg in the morning and\n50 mg in the evening).\nAn attempted interview was completed with Youth A. She\nrefused to answer any questions and demanded to leave the\nroom. After unsuccessful attempts to engage her, she was\nadvised she could leave.\n4",

She reported she has\nworked at the agency since May 2024. She confirmed that Youth\nA missed doses of her prescribed medication of Clozapine. She\nreported she believed it was due to miscommunication. She did\nnot think that a refill script was available. She recalled that to her\nknowledge, Youth A was taken for her monthly blood draw.\nMedical Staff 1 reported the last medical staff leaves at 9pm.\nWhen asked what occurs if PRN meds are requested after 9pm,\nshe replied that on call CRT staff would pass those medications.\nAn interview was held with Medical Staff 2. She reported working\nfor the agency since June 2024. She confirmed that Youth A\nmissed doses of her Clozapine and took her last prescribed dose\non 9/13/24. She is not sure how Youth A ran out of medication\nbut believes the Doctor did not send the prescription over. When\nmedications are noticed to be getting low, the other medical staff\nis notified. She does not recall who, if anyone, she notified\nregarding the Clozapine for Youth A running low. She could not\nrecall notifying any of the administrative staff or the Doctor.\nTour of Medical Room:\nThe medical room where medication is stored and dispensed was\nviewed. It was found to be properly secured with no visible\nconcerns.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nWhaley’s Medical Department Policy and Procedures Manual\nThe manual noted the following:\n• The medical supervisor will ensure medications are\nadministered to the child and youth during the appropriate\nmed pass times.\n• Guarantee medication is available to youth with no\ninterruptions.\n• Ensure all medication required for visits, transports or\nactivities is prepared and ready for the transporting staff\nand all medication exchange forms are completed\naccurately.\nWhaley Childrens Home QuickMAR form for Youth A.\n5",
