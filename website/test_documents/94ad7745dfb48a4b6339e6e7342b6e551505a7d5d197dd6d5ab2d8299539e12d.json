    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Agency did not adequately document how youth met eligibility\nrequirements for independent living prior to Independent Living\n(IL) placement.\nInvestigation Complainant was DCWL as different complaint was received\nif IL placement was appropriate for youth.\nFoster Care supervisor (FC supervisor) was interviewed via\ntelephone on August 24, 2023. She stated she was assigned to\nYouth A’s case just prior to him entering into the ILP program. She\nstated Youth A had been in a fictive kin placement since February\n2023 prior to ILP placement. The agency participated in a concern\nmeeting with other providers who had been working with Youth A.\nThere were some concerns regarding his school attendance but\nthere were a lot of strengths discussed as well. Youth A can be\nvery efficient and self-sufficient, but he could also make selfish\nchoices. A new placement needed to be found due to the fictive\nkin placement allowing Youth A to have contact with his biological\nmother who had her parental rights terminated. FC supervisor\nstated the agency made several attempts to locate a new\nplacement for Youth A. They were evaluating family members and\nmade an RPU referral but was unable to find an appropriate\nplacement. Youth A went AWOL and notified the agency several\ntimes that he did not want to go to residential and if he is sent to\nresidential, he will leave and not be found.\nFC supervisor reported approximately May 18, 2023, during a\nconcern meeting the idea of independent living was brought up.\nThe discussion centered around finding an IL program that had\nsupportive components so Youth A could learn the skills needed\nto live independently. Three more concern meetings were held to\ndiscuss placement options. All placement options were explored\nand evaluated.\nFC supervisor was asked about the most recent Parent Agency\nTreatment Plan (PATP) prior to Youth A being referred to ILP. The\nPATP stated Youth A was not ready to live independently. She\nstated the discussion during meetings involving Youth A was that\nhe had the core abilities and capabilities to take care of himself.\nHe did well during his placement with fictive kin and initially at the\nILP placement. Some of the criteria mentioned in the PATP\ninvolve parenting and housing which are things Youth A had never\nexperienced so in regard to those aspects Youth A was not\nprepared for IL. The agency had referred other youth to this\n2",
    "specific ILP program and were aware of the programming they\nhad to offer and outcomes with other youth.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nAugust 29, 2023. FCW stated she has been asking to Youth A’s\ncase since March 2023. Upon being assigned the case FCW\nstated there had already been ongoing discussion regarding\nreferring Youth A to an IL program. She stated she was under the\nimpression he was going to be or already accepted into an IL\nprogram through another agency. The initial referral to an IL\nprogram was denied due to his behaviors while in residential.\nWhile he was in fictive kin placement Youth A was doing well. He\nwas attending school, making good decisions and assisting with\nhousehold chores.\nFCW stated he was referred to an ILP because of the supports the\nprogram offered for youth. The understanding of the agency was\nthe program was meant for teaching youth independent living\nskills that were not already there. She stated he had some\nindependent living skills but did not have all of them and wouldn’t\nhave been appropriate to live on his own. The program he was\nreferred to was a group home setting with someone checking in 5\ndays per week that would assist him with IL skills.\nFoster Care supervisor 2 (FC supervisor 2) was interviewed\non August 30, 2023. FC supervisor 2 stated she was not\nassigned to Youth A’s case at the time he entered ILP but had\nbeen assigned just prior to that. Youth A had been in a residential\nprogram and then moved to a fictive kin placement. While in the\nfictive kin placement Youth A did well and was able to\ndemonstrate some independent living skills. Due to concerns with\nfictive kin allowing Youth A to have contact with his biological\nmother who had her parental rights terminated the agency was\nlooking into other placement options. Due to his age, length of\ntime in the system and level of functioning while in fictive kin\nplacement the agency started looking into ILP programs. The\nagency had also considered options of treatment foster care and\nWraparound. FC supervisor 2 was asked if, based on Youth A’s\npast behavioral concerns, if there were any concerns about him\nnot being ready for IL or ILP. She stated there is always some\nconcerns regarding readiness for IL when you’re referring 16- and\n17-year-olds. Youth with trauma usually have some behaviors.\nThe ILP programs are helpful due to the staffing and support that\nis available. The agency was looking into all of the least restrictive\nplacement options.\n3",
    "Documents reviewed:\n• April 20, 2023, PATP for Youth A authored by referring\nChild Placing Agency staff states under independent\nliving section: “As of 4/20/23, Youth A is unable to live\nindependently. Youth A scores as adequate in education,\ndaily living skills, and preventive health skills. Youth A lacks\nadequate parenting skills however is not an expectant\nparent. His lack of appropriate behavior would impede his\nability to adequately and safely provide for a young child.\nYouth A lacks money management and budgeting skills\ndue to his lack of experience in money management. Once\nbehaviors are appropriate, he will also be referred to MYOI.\nHousing and community resources also remains\ninadequate for Youth A as he has no experience for being\nsolely responsible for managing a household and is unable\nto obtain independent housing at this time. He also lacks\nthe supportive adults with which to be able to rent a room\nfrom for Independent Living. These needs will be\naddressed by ISK wrap around, ETFC and Kalamazoo\nCentral High School. Youth A has not utilized any YIT funds\nthis quarter. He participated in a semi-annual transition plan\nmeeting on 3/28/23. On 12/27/22 an updated credit report\nwas run, and no credit history was found”.\n• Referral email sent from referring Child Placing\nAgency: includes referral form, immunization record for\nYouth A, Youth A’s medical passport (unclear what date of\ncompletion is), June 2023 AWOL petition, SSN verification,\nMarch 2023 dental report, June 2022 psychological\nevaluation, Jan 2023 emergency room visit, medication\nrefusal form, January 2023 medication review, school\ngrades, January 2015 Initial Service Plan, December 2019\ntermination of parental rights, June 2023 medical passport,\nApril 2023 FTM DHS 1105, Youth A’s birth certificate,\nMarch 2023 Semi-annual transition plan DHS 901, and\nApril 2023 Permanent Ward Service Plan.\n• April 20, 2023, Permanent Ward Service Plan (PWSP)\nauthored by referring Child Placing Agency staff: report\nstates Youth A is getting set up with services from ETFC\nand ISK to build skills needed to be accepted into and\nachieve in an ILP placement. PWSP documents past\nsuicidal ideation and attempt as well as concern Youth A\ndoes not take his prescribed medication. Youth A would like\nto be placed in an IL program.\n• Review of SWC in MISACWIS case file: January 24,\n2023, SWC states residential placement submitted a 30-\nday notice for Youth A on January 18, 2023.
