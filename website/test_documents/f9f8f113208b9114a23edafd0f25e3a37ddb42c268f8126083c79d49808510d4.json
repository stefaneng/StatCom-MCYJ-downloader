This\nplacement appears contrary to the physical, emotional and safety needs\nof both youths.\nInvestigation The Reporting Source was not interviewed for this investigation because\na telephone number or contact information was not provided for an\ninterview.\nYouth A’s Caregiver (Foster Parent 1) was not interviewed for this\ninvestigation. Several Messages were left for Youth A’s Foster Parent to\ncontact this Consultant; however, no return calls were received.\nProgram Manager was interviewed face to-face 11/23/2022. She\nreported that Youth A was placed with their agency foster parent on\n07/30/2021. She reported that Youth A’s older sibling contacted Youth A\nover the weekend of October 8th and ask him could he babysit her child.\n4",
    "She reported Youth A wanted to babysit and that Youth A’s Foster Parent\n(Foster Parent 1) wanted to discuss with him babysitting his sister’s\nyoung child. She reported that after discussing this issue with Youth A,\nYouth A became enraged and destroyed items in his bedroom. The\nProgram Manager reported that Foster Parent 1 did not feel safe with\nYouth A in her home anymore and she arranged for Youth A’s sister’s\nFoster Parent (Foster Parent 2) to take Youth A into her home for respite\ncare. The Program Manager said the Foster Parents of both agencies\ndecided to make this decision on their own without following policies of\nboth agencies to notify caseworkers from Samaritas – Southeast and\nChild Safe agencies.\nThe Program Manager reported when she learned of this information on\nMonday, 10/10/2022 from Foster Parent 1 due to her stating she did not\nwant Youth A back into her home, she immediately reached out to Child\nSafe and DHHS to discuss case planning for Youth A on 10/11/2022. She\nsaid during this time, due to Youth A being in the home of Foster Parent\n2, and he was familiar with being in Foster Parent 2’s home, it was\ndecided to arrange for him to remain with Foster Parent 2 as emergency\nrespite until another placement was found for Youth A. This decision was\nbased on Foster Parent 1 not wanting Youth A to return to her home and\nYouth A’s refusal to return to the home of Foster Parent 1. She said a\nTeam Decision Meeting (TDM) was held on 10/18/2022, regarding\nplacement of Youth A. The Program Manager stated that Child Safe and\nDHHS were not in agreement of Youth A staying in the foster home of\nFoster Parent 2. She said a decision was made to seek another foster\nhome utilizing a borrowed bed. The Program Manager reported that due\nto Foster Parent 2’s home being the home of Youth A’s sister, a safety\nplan was created for the home and signed for the safety of both youths.\nThis plan was immediately shared with Foster Parent 2.\nProgram Manager reported another meeting was held with Child Safe\nand DHHS regarding Youth A’s placement on 10/25/2022. She said due\nto Child Safe and DHHS not agreeing with the placement of Youth A in\nFoster Parent 2’s home, a 4606 form was completed. This form is a\nplacement assistance request form that is completed any time the agency\nis looking for a new placement for a youth. She reported this form lists all\nthe efforts to obtain the most appropriate placement for a child per the\nrule (4) An agency shall consider all of the following factors in selecting\nan appropriate placement for a child: (a) The permanency goal for the\nchild. (b) The physical, emotional, and educational needs of the child. The\nProgram Manager reported an analysis of whether or not the placement\ndid or did not meet the youth needs were completed and this form was\nshared in the TDM held on 11/30/2022.\n4",
    "The Director of Child Safe was interviewed VIA telephone call. She\nexplained that her agency did not agree with the placement of Youth A in\ntheir foster home in the beginning. She said her agency learned that\nYouth A had gone to their foster home, (Foster Parent 2) on an\nemergency basis from her Licensing Supervisor on 10/11/2022. She said\nshe did not believe it was a good fit because her agency did not think\nFoster Parent 2 could handle supervising the youth one hundred percent.\nShe said the sexual allegation between the siblings was thoroughly\ndiscussed among the agencies and DHHS and although the sexual\ninteraction was not substantiated, safety measures were still taken when\nthe youth visited each other. The Director said Youth A and Youth B\nwere to be supervised at all times and that overnight visits between the\nyouths were no longer taking place as a precaution when Youth A visited\nthe home of Foster Parent 2. She said when the FTM occurred on\n10/18/2022 to discuss Youth A’s placement, Child Safe continued to\nexpress that long-term placement was not likely feasible. The Director\nsaid at that time DHHS agreed with Child Safe and that Samaritas was to\ncontinue to search for an alternate placement.\nThe Director of Child Safe reported on 10/24/22, Foster Parent 2\nexpressed to the Child Safe foster care worker that she may be willing to\nkeep Youth A on a permanent basis. Foster Parent 2 agreed that the\nyouths would be supervised at all times. The Director reported another\nFTM specifically for Youth A was held on 11/17/22, in which DHHS\nexpressed that this may not be the best placement and wanted Samaritas\nto continue to search for another home.\nThe Program Manager and Program Director of Samaritas and Child\nSafe reported a FTM was held on 11/30/22 to discuss both youth’s\nplacements. Both youths participated in this FTM. DHHS worker and\nsupervisor were also present. Youth A and B advocated for themselves\nand were very well-spoken. The sexual allegations were discussed with\nthe youth’s and they both agreed that they would not have a problem with\nbeing supervised at all times. The agencies agreed to put additional\nsupports in place for Foster Parent 2 and a detailed updated safety plan\nwould be completed. In addition, the agency provided Foster Parent 2\nwith door alarms so that she knows when a bedroom door opens or\nshuts. The Program Director of Child Safe reported there have been\nabsolutely no concerns of any inappropriate sexual behaviors between\nthe two youths since these allegations were reported. Both agencies and\nDHHS agreed that as long as safety measures are taken and the safety\nplan is reviewed every three months, placement could continue. DHHS\nalso agreed to the placement. Numerous safety plans were reviewed and\ncompleted during the time Youth A started his placement at Foster Parent\n2’s home.\n4",
    "The Program Manager reported that Youth B’s foster parent through\nChild Safe decided to maintain placement of Youth A and all parties\nagreed that the placement was appropriate with the safety plans\npreviously set in place. The Program Manager said additional placement\nassistance was not requested through the Regional Placement Unit. She\nsaid discussions regarding the previous sexual acting out behaviors\nbetween Youth A and Youth B were held during the meetings and all\nparties concurred that there had not been any concerns regarding this\ntype of behavior between the siblings since they were brought into\ncare. The siblings had frequent, and regular visitation facilitated between\nFoster Parent 1 and Foster Parent 2 and no concerns were noted. The\nProgram Manager said it was assessed with the safety plans in place\nwhereby Foster Parent 2, Youth A and Youth B agreed to the safety plan.\nShe said Foster Parent 2 agreed to maintain placement of Youth A and\nthis was in the youth’s best interest to be placed together. She said this\nalso allowed for sibling reunification.\nThe Program Director of Child Safe said that Foster Parent 2 is very\nexperienced and capable of handling difficult youth and has taken the\nsteps necessary to make sure that both youths are safe. She said she is\nin agreement with the placement.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Safety Plans for Youth A and Youth B.\n• Youth A’s Service plans in MiSACWIS discussing his history and\nbehaviors while in care.\nAnalysis The allegations of sexual behavior were never substantiated and there\nwas never any inappropriateness between Youth A and Youth B. Both\nYouth A and Youth B as well as Foster Parent 2 agreed to the safety\nplan. Foster Parent 2 is very experienced and capable of handling difficult\nyouth and has taken steps necessary to make sure that both youths are\nsafe. Samaratis – Southeast shared the 4606 form with all parties\nparticipating in the TDM held on 11/30/2022 regarding Youth A’s\npermanency goal and the physical, emotional, and educational needs of\nYouth A. It was at this meeting that all parties agreed that this is the best\nplacement for Youth A.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n4",

Youth A left his school district on 10/8/2022 and was\nnot enrolled into current school district until 11/21/2022.\nProgram Manager reported Youth A stopped attending his school on\n10/08/2022 when he had the altercation with his Foster Parent 1 and\nmoved to the home of Foster Parent 2. She said her agency was unable\nto get Youth A’s school to provide him with virtual learning and because\nhe was only supposed to be temporarily staying with Foster Parent 2,\nFoster Parent 2 was unable to enroll Youth A elsewhere. The Program\nManager reported that Youth A and his sister are in the same grade and\nhis sister brought Youth A’s her assigned schoolwork home so he could\nstay current with classes. The Program Manager said Youth A was\nofficially enrolled in his new school on 11/21/22 when Youth A’s\nplacement was made official.\nAnalysis Youth A was attending school regularly when placed with his foster\nparent with Samaritas - Southeast however, when his placement was\ninterrupted and he moved to another placement, he was unable to be\nenrolled into a different school district.

DHHS representative was present at this meeting. The\nterms of the safety plan were discussed, and Foster Parent 2 was told\nthat the youths could not be alone together at any time due to the\nprevious allegations between Youth A and Youth B alleged sexually\nacting out behavior although the allegations were not substantiated by\nDHHS.
