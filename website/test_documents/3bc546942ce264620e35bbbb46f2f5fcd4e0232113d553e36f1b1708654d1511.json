EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe facility has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first corrective action plan was regarding their 2020 Annual Licensing Inspection.\n4",
    "The second corrective action plan was regarding Special Investigation\n2020C0214035 which was initiated on 6/22/2020. The allegations involved a direct\ncare staff using profanity when dealing with a youth. The allegations were\nsubstantiated, and the facility was found to be in noncompliance with Rule 400.4123\n(Sufficiency of staff). The approved corrective action plan regarding this violation\ninvolved disciplinary action against the staff involved in the incident along with training\nfor all staff. This training involved de-escalation techniques, staff supporting each\nother, mindfulness, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and self-care training. The\nfacility indicated they will monitor each staff’s training in more depth and talk with staff\nduring staff meetings about potential issues.\nInterviews were conducted and involved one of the three youth. One youth was off\nsite at school and the other youth refused to be interviewed. The one youth\ninterviewed was very positive and indicated feelings safe and having her needs met\nat the facility. She also reported the staff are watchful and provide positive\ninteractions. The direct care staff interviewed reported feeling supported by the\nadministration and having “a lot of trainings” to help them in their interactions with the\nyouth. The supervisor and administration staff report adjusting to the change in their\ncontract but being able to provide the appropriate level of care for the youth. They\nalso present with a best practice focus.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n10/21/2021\n________________________________________\nPaul Fatato Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 21, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
