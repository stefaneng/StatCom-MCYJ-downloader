    "(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents’ needs, implementation of treatment plans,\nand discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was left at a hospital by facility staff.\nInvestigation The Complainant/Hospital Staff 1 was interviewed over the\nphone on 05/11/2023. She stated that she was directly involved in\nmuch of Youth A’s care during her time since coming to the\nhospital. At the time of this interview Youth A was still admitted to\nthe hospital. Hospital staff 1 stated that Youth A was consistent\nand forceful in stating that they did not want to return to placement\nat the facility upon discharge from the hospital. From the\nbeginning of Youth A’s time at the hospital, Hospital Staff 1\nrecalled having good communication with the staff from the facility\nand Foster Care worker. Hospital staff 1 recalled the incident in\nquestion occurring midday on 05/09/2023. She stated she helped\nescort Youth A out of the building because she had been\ndischarged that day. Prior to this Hospital staff 1 recalled\nspeaking with Foster Care worker and staff from the facility\nseparately but could not recall about the discharge and resulting\nsafety planning for how to work with Youth A if she did not\ncooperate with leaving to return to the facility for placement.\nHospital staff 1 stated that she, Youth A and facility staff were out\non the sidewalk in front of the hospital for a few minutes engaging\nwith Youth A and attempting to convince her to leave with facility\nstaff and return for placement, but Youth A was refusing. Hospital\nstaff 1 recalled one of the facility staff being present as\nAdministrator 1. Hospital staff 1 stated that Youth A had not\nescalated emotionally or physically but was just refusing to get in\nthe car to return to the facility for placement. During this\ninteraction, Hospital staff 1 recalled efforts being made to reach\nFoster Care worker and supervisor for assistance. Hospital staff 1\nstated that it was decided among the group of individuals working\nwith Youth A at that moment to take her back inside and go\nupstairs to the unit where she had previously been admitted.\nHospital staff 1 recalled that, at no point during that conversation\nwas it discussed that Youth A was going to be readmitted. She\nbelieved that facility staff would be coming inside with them to\nkeep engaging with Youth A and attempt to make more phone\ncalls. Hospital staff 1 stated that once they figured out that facility\nstaff was not going to be coming back inside, she was able to\nconnect with Foster Care worker, who was then able to contact\nfacility staff to come back to the hospital to continue working with\nYouth A.\n2",
    "Administrator 1 was interviewed over the phone during an\nunannounced face-to-face visit to the facility on 05/11/2023.\nAdministrator 1 stated that she was significantly involved in the\npreceding events leading up to the incident in question on\n05/09/2023 involving Youth A. Administrator 1 stated that Youth A\nfirst went to the hospital on 4/26/2023 because of escalated\nbehavior that included property destruction at the facility as well as\nself-harm and threats to staff concerns. Administrator 1 stated\nthat she and others on her staff had been in contact with Foster\nCare worker as well as hospital staff, including Hospital staff 1,\nsince that day. On the date of 05/09/2023 Administrator 1 stated\nthat they were driving to the hospital where Youth A had been\nadmitted because they were intending to pick her up after being\ndischarged to bring her back to the facility for continued\nplacement. Administrator 1 recalled talking with Youth A for about\na half hour attempting to engage with her to result in her coming\nback to the facility with them as intended, but Youth A continued\nto state that they would not do that. Youth A did not escalate in\nher emotions or behavior while they were speaking, she just\nrefused to come with them back to the facility as Administrator 1\nrecalled. Administrator 1 recalled hearing one of the hospital staff\n(of which she could not recall specifically who) state something to\nthe effect of “I guess we’ll take her back inside then.”\nAdministrator 1 stated that she assumed this meant that Youth A\nwas going to be readmitted back to the floor where Youth A had\npreviously been residing. She also recalled handing Youth A’s\npossessions back to hospital staff at that moment. After\nAdministrator 1 drove back to the facility, she stated she received\na phone call from the supervisor of Foster Care worker, who\ninformed her that the hospital had contacted him. Administrator 1\nstated that she was then informed that Youth A had not been\nreadmitted to the hospital at that point and it was requested that\nsomeone from the facility go back to supervise Youth A while the\nsituation continued to unfold. Administrator 1 stated that Staff 2\nwas sent back to the hospital to continue to provide supervision of\nYouth A at that time. Administrator 1 then spoke more about the\nconversations that had occurred prior to Youth A being brought\ndownstairs to the entrance of the hospital to be discharged and\ncome back to the facility. She stated that she had good\ncommunication with Foster Care worker prior to that and safety\nplans had been developed regarding the possibility that Youth A\nwere to run away or escalate physically, and that all were very\naware of the statements that Youth A had been making about not\nwanting to come back to the facility despite that being the\nplacement decision made for her. Administrator 1 confirmed that\n3",
    "she, nor anyone with the facility, had signed anything specific\nregarding the possible discharge of Youth A that day and that\nFoster Care worker had correctly done that. Administrator 1 was\nasked if she had heard clearly from any of the hospital staff that\nYouth A was being readmitted when they left the sidewalk and\ntook Youth A back inside the hospital and she stated she had not\nheard that at that time but assumed that meant that Youth A was\ngoing to be readmitted to the hospital.\nYouth A’s Foster Care worker and Foster Care supervisor were\ninterviewed over the phone on 05/12/2023. Foster Care worker\nstated that he was in a court hearing all day on 05/09/2023 but he\nwas aware that Youth A was likely to be discharged and had\nreceived positive communication from the facility about their\nacceptance of placement back with them, despite Youth A’s\nstatements that she did not want to be there. Foster Care\nsupervisor stated that he handled much of the communication\nduring the incident in question on 05/09/2023. His first phone call\nwas one received from Hospital staff 1 at the hospital. Foster\nCare supervisor stated that Hospital staff 1 described to him the\nsituation, that they had formally discharged Youth A and\nattempted to have her be transported back to the facility with staff\nfrom the program. Foster Care supervisor recalled that facility\nstaff had attempted to engage with Youth A for her to come back\nto the program with them, but Youth A refused. Hospital staff 1\nhad told Foster Care supervisor that she had brought Youth A\nback inside the hospital for a “change of scenery” and to continue\nto attempt to engage with her, but that facility staff did not come\nwith them. Foster Care supervisor stated he then called\nAdministrator 1 to inform her of what he heard from the hospital,\nconfirm that Youth A had not technically been readmitted and\nasked her to come back to the hospital. Foster Care supervisor\nstated that Administrator 1 was understanding and had a staff go\nright back to provide supervision to Youth A as the situation\ncontinued to unfold. Foster Care supervisor also recalled\nAdministrator 1 stating that she assumed that Youth A was being\nreadmitted at the time but did not disagree with the next course of\naction.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Notes dated 05/09/2023 were provided by the facility\ndocumenting what occurred during their interactions with\nYouth A and the incident in question. In these notes it is\ndescribed that there was communication by facility staff\nwith Foster Care worker that Youth A was being discharged\non 05/09/2023. The facility had prepared Youth A’s room\n4",
    "for her and went to pick her up from the hospital. The note\ncontinues to describe the course of events of Youth A\nrefusing to come back to the facility, being taken back\ninside to the hospital and facility staff departing the hospital\nall similar to what was provided in interviews for this\ninvestigation. When alerted that Youth A was back at the\nhospital in a waiting room unattended by Foster Care\nsupervisor, facility staff went back to the hospital to provide\nsupervision of her.\n• Safety Plan for Youth A dated 05/09/2023 provided by the\nfacility and signed by Youth A’s Foster Care worker. In this\nsafety plan options are described on how to respond to\nYouth A if she were to become a threat to herself or others\nand if she began to destroy property. It is also stated that if\nYouth A refused to get in the vehicle of facility staff upon\ndischarge that public safety will ensure that she gets in the\nvehicle as requested. Courses of action were also\ndescribed if Youth A were to run away from staff upon\ndischarge.\n• Facility policies & procedures were provided. In response\nto CCI Rule 400.4127 it is stated that the facility will\n“maintain a staff to resident ratio that shall assure the\ncontinual safety, protection, and direct care and supervision\nof residents.” It goes on to describe a 3 staff to one youth\nratio specifically.\nAnalysis Through face-to-face contact at the facility, phone and video\ninterviews and documentation reviewed there was evidence to\nshow that the facility did not provide supervision of Youth A\nwithout clearly knowing that she had been readmitted to the\nhospital and that supervision was not required.\nConclusion Violation Established\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n06/16/2023\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 20, 2023\n________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"

    "summary": "Facility staff attempted to pick up Youth A from a hospital following discharge but left the youth at the hospital after she refused to return to the facility. Staff incorrectly assumed the youth was being readmitted to the hospital and would be under hospital supervision, when in fact she was left unattended in a waiting room, requiring staff to return. The investigation concluded the facility failed to ensure continual supervision as required. Culpability lies with the facility for making an assumption without clear confirmation and failing to follow its own safety procedures.",
