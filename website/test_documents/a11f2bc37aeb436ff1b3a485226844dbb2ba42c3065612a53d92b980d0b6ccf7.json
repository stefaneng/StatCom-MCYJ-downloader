    "Adrian Group Home physical restraint interventions policy was\nreviewed- policy outlines the agencies approved and unapproved\nbehavioral intervention methods and follow up procedures after an\nintervention. The policy outlines that all physical restraint\ninterventions are performed by two staff members and no\nindividual staff member will perform a restraint by themselves and\nthat physical restraint shall be limited to situations of serious self-\nharm or injury to others. The policy does not provide for prone\nrestraints, lifting, or carrying youth.\nYouth Worker 1's training hours were reviewed, and he completed\n8 hours of CPI training on 7/19/2022.\nYouth Worker 2's training hours were reviewed, and he completed\nCPI training on 12/13/22 and 12/18/23.\nAnalysis The facility is in violation of the rule. Youth Worker 1 was\nobserved in the video footage to have Youth A in a one-person\nrestraint against the wall and then moved to having Youth A prone\non the floor with his hands behind his back. Youth Worker 1\nadmitted he used restraint techniques that were not allowed and\nthat he was not trained in. The Youth Supervisor and Youth\nWorker 2 both observed Youth Worker 1 standing over Youth A\nholding him prone on the ground with his hands being held behind\nhis back. Youth A reported Youth Worker 1 pushed him on the\nfloor and held his hands real tight behind his back.\nThe facility is in violation of their physical restraint interventions\npolicy. Youth Worker 1 performed a one-person restraint that\nended with Youth A prone on the floor. This is not in line with the\nrule or agency policy.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & R 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction, prevention;\nSection prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (5) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nmanner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff member did not follow the agency’s restraint policy.\n8",
    "Investigation Refer to above content related to this incident of restraint.\nAnalysis Youth Worker 1 lifted/carried the youth when transporting, placed\nYouth A in a one-person restraint, held the youth with his face in\nthe corner, and used a prone restraint while holding the youth's\nhands behind his back. He acknowledged using techniques not\ntaught in his restraint training. These restraint methods are not in\nline with the agency restraint model or the rule and were unsafe\nand inappropriate. Staff must only use approved restraint\ntechniques.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of Staff\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was suspended from school and the facility was unable to\npick up Youth A due to not having enough staff.\nInvestigation An additional complaint was received on 2/9/23 involving Adrian\nGroup Home and Youth A. The complaint noted the following:\nYouth A (8) is in foster care and placed at the Adrian Group\nHome. He attends Laura Haviland School. On 2/8/23, the group\nhome was called and asked to pick Youth A up early from school\ndue to him having issues there. Staff were not able to pick him up\nearly, so law enforcement, that was already at the school, brought\nhim home. Youth A has bruising on his upper right bicep. He\nindicated being restrained at the school and his arm being\npinched. It's unclear who caused this as he first stated the police\ndid it and then stated teachers at the school.\nYouth Supervisor reported on 2/8/23 the school called and said\nYouth A was escalated and asked could someone come get him.\nThere was another youth home sick that day and the Youth\nSupervisor was the only staff at the facility. She reported she\nindicated to the school it would take about one to one and a half\nhours to get staff in to come get Youth A. Approximately 10:45am\nthe police showed up with Youth A to drop him off. Youth\nSupervisor reported that the police are sometimes at the school\nand help out and that was the case this day. Youth A was calm\nwhen he arrived home with the police. Youth A was hungry, so\n9",
    "Youth Supervisor made him lunch and attempted to find out what\nhappened at school from Youth A. He reported his stomach hurt\nand he couldn't play the math game, so he wanted to come home.\nYouth Supervisor said the agency’s compliance officer arrived at\nthe facility shortly after Youth A arrived home. She was there to\nsee Youth A and for another scheduled meeting. Youth A showed\nthe compliance officer a bruise on his right underarm bicep area.\nThe Youth Supervisor said the facility also had a staff meeting and\ntraining that day and staff were switching in and out with\nmonitoring the two youth and doing the training. The Youth\nSupervisor reported the Director was with the two youth that were\nhome that day and Youth A was picking at and antagonizing\nYouth B. The Supervisor reported she was coming out of the\ntraining room and saw Youth B running down the hallway after\nYouth A. The Director and the Supervisor followed them, and\nYouth B reportedly had ahold of Youth A and had him pinned\nagainst the wall. Her hand was on top of Youth A's head, and she\nwas pushing it into the wall. The Supervisor reported she was able\nto place her hand in front of Youth A's head and was able to move\nhim out and separate the youth.\nThe Youth Supervisor reported she and the Director took Youth A\nto urgent care on 2/9/23 at the request of the Government Worker.\nYouth A reportedly said his shin bruise was from the restraint\ndone on 2/6/23. The Supervisor reported Youth A said the bruise\non his arm/bicep area was from school. The Supervisor reported\nthat Youth A said teachers pinch him to move him and that is how\nhe got the injuries on his arm. The Youth Supervisor reported this\nto centralized intake. The Youth Supervisor reported she did not\nsee Youth A's upper arm after he was restrained on 2/6/23 or\nbefore the school incident on 2/8/23. The Youth Supervisor\nbecame aware of Youth A's bruised upper arm/bicep when he\nshowed the compliance officer on 2/8/23.\nYouth A said the police brought him home yesterday from school\nand they were mad at him. Youth A refused to discuss what\nhappened at school and then said he was restrained at school,\nand they pinched him. Youth A indicated he didn't know who\nrestrained him at school and he then showed us the same bruise\non his arm.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nThe staffing requirements and supervision policy was reviewed.\nPolicy outlines the minimum staffing requirements and supervision\nof clients is maintained at each location. Each location has a\nwritten schedule that includes provisions for use of relief staff and\n10",
    "a backup plan for emergencies. The Youth Supervisor reported\nshe called the staff that had just left from third shift and additional\nstaff who were unable to come into work to assist with picking up\nYouth A.\nSchool Incident reports, school time out logs, and a school\nseclusion report were reviewed from 2/7/23 and 2/8/23. All\nreports outline Youth A's aggressive and defiant behaviors at\nschool.\nIncident report dated 2/8/23 @ 2:20pm- authored by the Director.\nYouth A was antagonizing Youth B and took the coloring book\nfrom her and threw it at her. Youth A ran down the hall and Youth\nB chased after him and pinned him against the wall and was\npressing his head against the wall. Youth A said his head hurt. He\nwas offered ice and declined. Youth A has a scratch on his right\ntemple from fighting with peer.\nIncident report dated 2/8/23 @ 4pm authored by the compliance\ncoordinator -the compliance coordinator was at the facility and\nnoticed a bruise on Youth A's upper arm. Youth A reported the\nbruise came from school staff that did it that morning while trying\nto restrain him. He also reported the police pulled him by his ears\nwhile getting him to their car to take him home.\nAnalysis The facility is not in violation of the rule. Although there was not\nextra staff at the facility to immediately go pick up the youth, due\nto a youth being at the facility ill, the facility gave a 1-1/2 hour\ntimeframe to the school for them to come and pick him up. This is\na reasonable and prudent timeframe.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The staff requirement and\nsupervision policy indicate each location will have a schedule with\nrelief staff and a backup plan for emergencies. The schedule has\na number to call for emergencies and no information regarding\nrelief staff. The agency needs to have an emergency plan and\nrelief staff in place based on their policy.\nConclusion Violation Not Established.\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\nDescription (a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\n11",
    "Allegation Staff member received a confirmed case for Improper\nSupervision.\nInvestigation Youth Worker 1 placed Youth A in a prone restraint while holding\nthe youth's hands behind his back. This is a restricted restraint\nwhich could have resulted in injuries or asphyxiation. asphyxiation.\nAnalysis Youth Worker 1's behavior is evidence that he doesn't have the\nability to perform the duties of his assigned position.\nThe Government Worker deemed Youth Worker 1 unsuitable to\nwork with children.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n_____________________________________03/07/2023\nTracey Ventola Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n03/28/2023\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n12"
