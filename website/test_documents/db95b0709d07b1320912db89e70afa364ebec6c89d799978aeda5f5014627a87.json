    "Worker Z used a one person hold to manage Youth J as well as\nYouth B during separate incidents that occurred that day. Staff\nare not permitted to conduct restraints by themselves. Although\nYouth Worker Z conducted these restraints unassisted no harm\ncame to either child. There are no concerns of abuse or neglect,\nbut Youth Worker Z has been placed on a safety plan in which he\ncannot work alone with any resident, and he can't be involved in\nany restraints whatsoever. Youth Worker Z has no history of\ndisciplinary action or issues.\nI interviewed Youth C face to face at Haviland School with the\nGovernment Worker on 5/31/23. Youth C reported she lives at\nAdrian Home and that she likes some of the kids there and some\nbully her. Youth C was able to identify some of the staff that work\nat the facility and when asked about staff she reported that Youth\nWorker M hurt her arm and pulled back her sleeve and showed us\na purplish bruise. The bruise was on the top of her right arm\nbetween the elbow and wrist and had a finger like appearance.\nYouth C reported that she got the bruise when she was in her\nroom and Youth Worker M grabbed her arm. Youth C reported\nshe wanted her light off and Youth Worker M grabbed and pulled\nher arm to stop her from turning off the light.\nYouth C reported she went to turn off the light in her room and\nYouth Worker M thought she was going to “attack her”.

Youth C reported she told a lady at the\nfacility about her arm, but she couldn't remember her name. Youth\nC reported she feels safe \"most of the time\" and then said, \"I don't\nknow; I don't feel safe when people hurt me like, Youth Worker M\".\nI interviewed Youth J at Michener Elementary School on 5/31/23\nface to face with the Government Worker.

He reported he has been in\nemployment with Adrian Group Home for approximately one\nmonth and was recently promoted to Team Leader. Team Leader\nD reported after becoming employed with the facility he became\nconcerned about the behavior he saw other employees exhibit\nand that was accepted. He went on to say that it appeared to be\nan \"old school\" parenting type of approach with yelling and anger\nand not using verbal de-escalation techniques. Team Leader D\nreported he began bringing in activities and things to do with the\nyouth as he felt this would assist with time being more structured\nand constructive for the youth.\nTeam Leader D reported on 5/27/23 the residents were watching\na movie and Youth C spilled water on Youth N.

Team Leader D reported he did not think that was how they\nwould transport Youth C, but when Youth Worker M grabbed\nYouth C’s legs he felt he had to support Youth C's back and upper\nbody.

Team Leader D reported he was\nunsure how Youth C got the bruises as she was hitting and\npunching a lot of things that evening and he did not remember\nseeing Youth Worker M grab Youth C’s arm.

Youth Worker Z reported at\nthe same time Youth J was passing gas at the dinner table and he\nwas worried he was “going to mess himself” as he was forcing out\nmore gas.

Youth Worker Z\nindicated again he handled the situation to the best of his ability.\nYouth Worker Z reported his memory is foggy, but he believes\nYouth S got out of the sensory room and went into the kitchen and\nwas on the floor and Youth Worker A was asking for help with\nYouth S. Youth Worker Z reported that Youth Worker A was\nscared of Youth S and it was common for him to see Youth S like\nthis so he picked him up off the kitchen floor by himself and took\nhim to the sensory room. Youth Worker Z then reported he knows\nhe was not supposed to pick up a youth off the ground and should\nhave just left him. Youth Worker Z denied that Youth S was a\nthreat when he was on the ground in the kitchen, and he “just\nreacted” and put him in the sensory room.

    "do activities with the youth to avoid this. Youth Worker Z reported\n“I was trying to take care of everything, be the man of the\nsituation”. Youth Worker Z reported the youth are allowed to\njump on his back so he should be able to pick them up. He also\nreported “what I did was effective, and nobody was hurt “. Youth\nWorker M reported he did write an incident report for Youth Q\npunching the wall and destruction of property but didn’t write any\nfor his restraints or incidents with Youth Q, Youth S or Youth J as\nhe felt his incidents with them were minor.\nThis writer interviewed Youth S on 6/6/23 face to face at the\nfacility in collaboration with the Government Worker.
