Youth A has since been\nplaced in another facility.\nI reviewed incident report dated 01/10/2023. It states Youth A and\nanother youth leaving the facility grounds upon transport from the\ngymnasium to the housing building at 3:00PM. Staff attempted to\nprevent youth from walking out the gymnasium door by standing in\nfront of it and very redirecting them to comply with programming.\nIt is noted Youth A returned to the facility at 1:00AM.\nI also reviewed an incident report dated 01/08/2023. It states\nYouth A and another youth AWOLed from the facility on\n01/08/2023 at 12:00AM. Both returned to the facility at 5:00AM,\nbroke into the facility gymnasium, and stole an I-Pad. Police\nresponded to the alarm and the I-Pad was not located on the\nyouth. The police returned the youth to the facility.\nI interviewed Youth A at another child caring institution with DHHS\nWorker 1 on 05/19/2023. He reports previously being placed at\nthe facility and states he AWOLed daily and then lessened the\namount of AWOL’s to “once in a while”. Youth A denies ever\ngetting marijuana from staff and states he would get money from\nhis “peoples” in the community and then purchase marijuana from\nthe gas station and used it in an unknown house. Youth A\nremembers AWOLing from the facility on his birthday at\napproximately 3:00PM and notes that Staff Person 1 worked the\nthird shift and was not present when he left the facility and did not\n2",
    "remember him being present when he arrived back at the facility.\nYouth A states Staff Person 1 was “straight” and denies Staff\nPerson 1 giving him marijuana or any other gift for his birthday.\nHe states Staff Person 1 and other staff knew Youth A smoked\nmarijuana because Youth A states he usually came back to the\nfacility high from being AWOL. Youth A does state he got a cake\nfrom his Case Worker the week prior to his birthday. It is noted\nthat Youth A asked who the referral source was at his current\nplacement.\nI interviewed Staff Peron 1 onsite with DHHS Worker 2 on\n05/25/2023. He reports being employed by the facility for five\nmonths with no disciplinary issues. He does no recall Youth A\nthough remembers a resident getting a cake for his birthday. Staff\nPerson 1 denies giving Youth A or any other resident a gift and\ndenies purchasing marijuana for any residents as well. He does\nnot know of any staff that have purchased or given marijuana to\nany residents as well. He states he usually works the 11PM-7AM\nshift and does not recall if he worked a double shift on 01/10/2023.\nI interviewed Youth’s B and C onsite with DHHS Worker 2 on\n05/25/2023.

She reports having observed Staff Person 1 work\nwith the residents and states that he is a good role model for\nthem.

Youth A\ntruanted from the facility on his birthday at 3:00PM and did not\nreturn to the facility until 1:00AM. Youth A denies Staff Person 1 of\ngiving him marijuana for his birthday and states he gets money\nfrom his “peoples” in the community to purchase marijuana from\nthe gas station when he truants.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
