One staff had worked in the agency as an intern,\nso this was a good fit for the agency because she was aware of the paperwork\nthat came along with the job. Staff praised their administration and coworkers.\nThey love working as a team and the amount of respect they receive from doing\ntheir job from the administrative staff.
