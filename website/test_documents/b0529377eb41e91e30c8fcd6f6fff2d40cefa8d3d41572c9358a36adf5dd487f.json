INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4125 Personal possessions; money; clothing;\nSection storage space.\nDescription (1) A licensee shall have a written policy that designates all of the\nfollowing:\n(c) The method for ensuring that each resident has sufficient\nclean, properly fitting, seasonal clothing.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Upon admission Youth B was only allowed underwear to wear for\nseveral days while quarantining.\nInvestigation Youth B is a temporary court ward who was court-ordered into\ntreatment at Maurice Spear Campus on 9/19/22. According to\nChief Administrator (CA), since his admission, the Complainant,\nYouth B’s mother, has made numerous false accusations against\nthe facility. Complainant promised to “do whatever it takes” to get\nher son out. On 2/28/2023, she sent an ambulance to the facility\nfor Youth B even though he was not in the building and was\nworking off-site. CA said he explained to paramedics Youth B\nwas not there and that no one from the facility had called them.\nSince Youth B’s admission, the facility Nurse said she has been\nconsistently available and has responded to all of the\nComplainant’s concerns about her son. Rather than utilize the\nfacility’s written grievance process Complainant has chosen to\nmake verbal complaints. Moving forward CA plans to participate\nin all future contacts between the Nurse and Complainant to\nwitness and document what occurs.\n2",
    "In addition to issues with this facility, CA said Complainant is well\nknown to the local county courts and juvenile justice personnel.\nThis year she contacted a newspaper with allegations against\nanother juvenile facility and the paper wrote a damaging article\nabout them. CA said the court is currently considering limiting\nComplainant’s contact with her son and Maurice Spear Campus\nstaff to once weekly during visiting hours and family therapy as\nshe is interfering with his treatment. For these reasons, I did not\ncontact the Complainant to seek additional information regarding\nher concerns.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 3/2/23. Upon admission in\nSeptember 2022, he said he spent five days in detention on\nquarantine due to COVID. During this time Youth B said he was\ngiven a wool blanket and only allowed to wear underwear. Asked\nif he was given a smock, he responded, “I didn’t need a smock.\nThey only give those to kids who attempt suicide.”\nI observed the youth rooms in the detention building but no youths\nwere present. Each room had a mattress, mattress platform,\nblanket, and pillow. I also observed the suicide gowns referred to\nas “smocks.” The smocks are the same color (dark green) and\nmade from the same heavy quilted material as some of the\nblankets. CA said it is protocol that youth wear their underwear\nand are provided with blankets in quarantine. They are also\nroutinely offered a smock but can choose not to wear it. Since it is\npart of the regular routine, it would not be documented that Youth\nB was offered and refused to wear a smock.\nAnalysis In quarantine Youth B said he wore his underwear and was given\na wool blanket. He said did not need a suicide smock.\nFacility protocol is that youth are allowed to wear their underwear\nand a suicide smock (made of heavy quilted material) in\ndetention/quarantine. While he may have refused to wear it, there\nis no evidence Youth B was not allowed to wear a suicide smock\nin addition to his underwear.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "Rule Code & Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth B has ringworm, skin issues, a finger injury, breathing\nissues and a chipped tooth, none of which have been treated.\nYouth B was forced to attend school with a fever. Youth B found\nblood on his pillow on 2/26/23.\nInvestigation On 3/2/23, I observed a faded pink semi-circular rash the size of a\nhalf-dollar on Youth B’s right bicep. He denied that it itches. I\nasked Youth B about ringworm. He said the Nurse gave him\ntopical cream, but it did not resolve the problem. After that Youth\nB saw a dermatologist who identified the rash as ringworm and\nprescribed another topical cream. Youth B said the cream\nprescribed by the dermatologist also does not work and that he\nwill know it worked when the rash disappears.\nRegarding the skin on his feet, Youth B said he has bumps and\nitching between his toes otherwise known as athlete’s foot. He\nhas been using over-the-counter anti-fungal cream twice daily\nsince 10/19/22. He said the cream “doesn’t work” but he has not\ninformed the facility nurse.\nThe facility staffs a full-time registered nurse (Nurse) and a Family\nNurse Practitioner (FNP) who provides weekly in-person\nconsultation.\nOn 9/20/22, an initial health screening indicated Youth B has “red\npatch on right arm – onset 9 months ago. Saw Dr. who didn’t\nrecommend Tx.”\nOn 10/26/22, Nurse noted “follow-up athlete’s foot. Continue\ncream as ordered. See FNP next visit.” A consult form by FNP\ndated 11/1/22 indicates Youth B’s “sole of right foot erythematic\nskin; cracked scaley: 2” diameter round red scaley patch on his\nright upper arm, presumptive Tinea Corporis (ringworm) of ten\nmonths. Referral to Dermatologist.”\nOn 11/15/22 Nurse noted “Re-visit rash to arm. Continue\nantifungal to feet twice daily, started antifungal to arm twice daily.\n4",
    "If released, make referral to dermatology per Probation Officer.\nMother aware. If goes to O/U, make appointment.”\nOn 12/5/22 Nurse noted “review use of athlete’s foot cream. Non-\nuse: resident reports ‘not working.’ Continue to keep in place.\nDermatology in place.”\nOn 1/5/23 Nurse noted “rash on feet and arm, tinea pedis; tinea\ncorporis. Ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily until clear. Keep\nfeet dry.”\nMedication logs indicate Youth B used antifungal cream for foot\nand arm from 10/24/22 through 1/5/23 and Ketoconazole 2% from\n1/6/23 to present.\nI interviewed Nurse on 3/2/23. She has worked at the facility for\nthree years. Nurse said Youth B saw a dermatologist on 1/5/23\nwho ordered a prescription antifungal cream that youth has used\nsince 1/5/23. Nurse said a follow-up dermatology appointment is\nscheduled on 3/14/23 for both the ringworm and athlete’s foot.\nIn December 2022, Youth B said he injured his right index finger,\nwas x-rayed and given a splint. Upon observation, the finger\nappears to have healed crooked. Youth B said he was seen again\nat urgent care and directed to continue wearing the splint during\nthe night, but he decided to stop wearing it. He seems resigned to\nthe fact his finger is crooked and stated, “there’s nothing I can do\nabout it.”\nOn 12/28/22, Nurse noted “right pointer finger injury with\nbasketball net. Discussed with FNP. Urgent care visit for x-ray.\nSpoke with mother (Complainant).”\nOn 12/28/22, Youth B was seen at Adrian Urgent Care and\ndiagnosed with “Mildly displaced fracture of middle phalanx of\nindex finger, initial encounter for closed fracture – uncomplicated.\nPrescribed Ibuprofen three times per day for pain. Referred to\northo. No sports until evaluated by ortho. Copy of x-ray sent with\npatient.”\nOn 12/29/22, Youth B was seen by an orthopedic surgeon who\nindicated “Stax splint around the clock. Ok to remove to shower.\nChange powerflex wrap daily. Return visit 2/2/23 @ 10:30am.”\n5",
    "On 2/2/23 Youth B saw orthopedic surgeon for follow up who\nindicated “ok to remove splint during day and work on range of\nmotion. Wear splint at night recommend 6 weeks.”\nNurse said Youth B has a follow-up appointment with the\northopedic surgeon on 3/16/23.\nFor five weeks, Youth B said he has been experiencing breathing\ndifficulties due to congestion. He was given over-the-counter\nnasal spray, Claritin and Zyrtec, but the problem continues.\nMedical professionals believe he has allergies or possibly a\ndeviated septum. Youth B said he is scheduled to see an ears,\nnose and throat specialist later this month.\nOn 1/23/23, Nurse noted Youth B was seen for “sinus congestion.\nTwo sprays each nare – 4 times as needed. Over-the-counter\nnasal spray.”\nOn 2/10/23, Youth B was seen by FNP who noted “feels like\nsomething is up in right nare causing congestion but nothing\nblows out. Was using saline nasal spray. Has seen small amount\nblood from left nostril. Denies other symptoms. Assessment:\nChronic Rhinitis exacerbated by low humidity environment of\nwinter. Recommend: Claritin or Zyrtec per standing orders; may\napply tiny amount of triple antibiotic ointment inside nares.”\nOn 2/21/23, Youth B was seen by FNP who noted “for Rhinitis –\nLoratadine trial ineffective- still sniffling. Staff reports even at night\nwhile asleep. Denies cough, nasal discharge clear. Recommend:\nD/C Loratadine; Begin trial of Zyrtec x 7 days per standing orders;\nWill consider ENT referral if Zyrtec ineffective. Reassess in one\nweek if better or worse.”\nOn 2/28/23, Youth B was seen by FNP who assessed “ongoing\nRhinitis possibly secondary to deviated septum; possible\nallergies.” Recommend: Called mom…is very concerned about\ncardiopulmonary status. Spoke with mom for approx. 30\nminutes… ENT referral asap.\nNurse said Youth B has an ENT appointment scheduled on\n3/24/23.\nYouth B said he chipped a back molar and a dentist “filled it.”\nThere are no pending issues with his teeth.\n6",
    "On 1/19/23 Nurse noted Youth B had a dental visit. “Mom wanted\nto be notified of care given/decisions made by dentist especially if\nroot canal needed. Follow up with receptionist stated Dr. would\nonly need to cap tooth. Mom made aware and agreeable.”\nA youth dental exam form indicated the dentist examined Youth B,\ntook x-rays, and filled his tooth on 1/19/23.\nYouth B said in December 2022, he was “really sick and needed\nto see a doctor but all they gave me was Ibuprofen. The next\nmorning, I could barely move. The nurse made me go to\nschool…A doctor would have given me actual medicine, not\nIbuprofen.”\nNurse noted that staff informed her on 12/18/22 after-hours that\nYouth B had a 100-degree fever and Tylenol was administered\nwith a positive effect. The next morning (12/19/22) Nurse saw\nYouth B and noted “no fever at this time. Covid test negative. Has\nbeen resting since 3pm yesterday. Recommend: Up for school –\nrule out cold virus, start Musinex over the counter twice daily until\nresolved, monitor temp, increase fluids, Tylenol, or Ibuprofen per\nprotocol for achiness (parents aware). On 12/20/22 Nurse noted\n“rechecked; reports feeling better.” On 12/21/22, Nurse noted\n“checked ears, complained of earache, assessed ears, no\nconcern. Have FNP recheck at next visit.”\nOn 12/19/22, after seeing him in the morning and his temperature\nwas normal, Nurse said she made the decision Youth B was well\nenough to attend school that day.\nOn 2/26/23, Youth B said he woke up and there was blood on his\npillow. Nurse indicated a nosebleed would not be uncommon due\nto the dry winter air conditions combined with Youth B’s constant\n“sniffling.” “Over the counter nasal spray ordered.”\nAnalysis Even though his athlete’s foot, the rash on his arm and nasal\ncongestion persist, there is no evidence Youth B’s medical issues\nare not being treated or addressed. He has had multiple\nappointments with the facility nurse and FNP and has been\ntreated by general physicians, a dentist, dermatologist, and\northopedic surgeon.\nThe facility’s nurse and FNP have been in continuous\ncommunication with Youth B’s mother, the Complainant, and\ncontinue to follow up with his ongoing medical concerns. Follow-\nup appointments are scheduled with his dermatologist and\n7",
    "orthopedic surgeon on 3/14/23 and 3/16/23, respectively and he is\nscheduled to see an ear, nose, and throat specialist on 3/24/23.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
