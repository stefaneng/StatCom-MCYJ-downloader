INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Eligibility requirements\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12504\nSection (1) An agency shall document the rationale for selection of\nDescription independent living as the most appropriate placement for\nthe youth.\n1",
    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was in an Independent Living Placement and went to the\nhospital after experiencing a mental health episode. Youth left the\nhospital and was staying in a shelter. Following this, youth was\nlocated by law enforcement wearing minimal clothing. Youth was\nthen dropped off at the residence of an adult with little items or\nmedications. There is a concern with the youth's case\nmanagement and if the youth is appropriate for IL given their\nneeds. They were unable to be contacted recently.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nDirector was interviewed via video conferencing on 9/24/2024\nabout concerns that arose about Youth A’s appropriateness for\nIndependent Living placement after reading a complaint received\nby DCWL . Director reported Youth A’s assigned worker at the\ntime of the complaint, Foster Care Worker, no longer works for the\nagency and the current worker does not know Youth A yet;\nhowever, Director is very familiar with Youth A’s case. Director\nreported Youth A was referred to the agency by MDHHS staff for\nILP placement and services in November of 2023 after Youth A\nsuccessfully completed residential programming. Director stated\nYouth A was interviewed for the agency’s ILP program and did\nvery well , so she was accepted into the program on November\n20, 2023. Youth A actively participated in the program and was\nsuccessful for three months after which she wanted to live\nindependently with an identified supportive adult. Director stated\nthe agency kept case management responsibility because Youth\nA was doing so well working with the agency’s case managers\nand therapist. Director stated Youth A continued to attend school,\nlook for employment, take her medications, and participate in\ntherapy. After a few weeks, Youth A reached out to the ILP house\nmanager, who is a support to Youth A, and asked if she could\nmove back in due to a falling out with the adult with whom she\nwas living. Director stated she and the ILP staff had a meeting\nwith Youth A to discuss the program rule requirements to which\nYouth A agreed. Youth A moved back into the ILP home in July of\n2024. After three weeks, Youth A had a friend help her move out\nof the ILP home after the staff had left for the day. Director and the\nILP staff met with Youth A who stated she moved out because she\ndid not want to follow house rules and wanted to live with an adult\nshe refers to as her aunt, Caregiver. Director stated Foster Care\nWorker visited Caregiver’s home and deemed it appropriate for\nYouth A. Caregiver agreed to allow Youth A to move in and stated\nshe was willing to provide support to Youth A, so Youth A moved\ninto her home as an IL placement at the end of July. Youth A was\n2",
    "17 at the time and agreed to attend school and look for a job.\nShortly after, Youth A stopped taking her medication and started\nexperiencing mental health concerns resulting in her visiting local\nemergency rooms. Director stated it has been difficult getting help\nfor Youth A when she goes to the local hospital as she yells and\nspits when she does not get immediate attention resulting in the\nhospital staff believing her actions are strictly behavioral, so they\nsedate and restrain her rather than addressing her mental health\nconcerns. Youth A stayed at the hospital for 5-7 days with agency\nstaff remaining with her 24/7, after which Youth A was discharged\nto Caregiver’s home. Youth A would agree to follow up with her\ndoctor for her medication but ended up back in the emergency\nroom. Director stated this happened more than once. Director\nreported Youth A was continuing to attend school in between her\nemergency room visits.\nDirector stated she didn’t know Youth A was in an emergency\nshelter at any point and doesn’t know how that would have come\nabout unless she went there on her own. After each\nhospitalization, Youth A has returned to Caregiver’s home.\nCaregiver did tell Director she had tried to call Foster Care Worker\nover a weekend when Youth A was brought to her home by the\npolice, but Foster Care Worker did not answer. Caregiver has\nexpressed to Director her continued willingness to provide support\nto Youth A. Youth A is currently hospitalized, and Caregiver will be\nparticipating in a scheduled Family Team Meeting to discuss\nYouth A’s upcoming discharge and return to Caregiver’s home.\nDirector stated Youth A is turning 18 next week and is adamant\nshe wants her case closed. She has been provided information\nabout the Young Adult Voluntary Foster Care program and its\nbenefits but continues to state she wants her case closed at the\nnext court hearing scheduled for October 10, 2024.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nThe following documents were reviewed in Youth A’s case record:\no 11/9/2022 court order documenting Youth A’s goal as\nAnother Planned Living Arrangement as reunification is not\nappropriate\no 11/20/2023 enrollment in alternative education\no 6/21/2024 Case Service Plan Documenting Youth A’s\nparticipation in school, therapy, and summer employment\no 9/12/2024 Case Service Plan in which Youth A’s\nparticipation in life skills classes and school attendance is\ndocumented as well as a recommendation Youth A\ncontinue in Independent Living Placement as reunification\n3",
