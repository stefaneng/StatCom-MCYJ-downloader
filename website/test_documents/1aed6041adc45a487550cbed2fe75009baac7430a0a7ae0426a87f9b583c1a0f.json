    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during\nthis period under review.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator (CA) report dated 4/4/2025 and signed\n5/1/2025. The CA report indicated the agency has no youths in care at this time;\nand the agency is in the process of obtaining a contract with the department.\nDuring a discussion with the agency administrators related to this matter, the CA\nreported the delay or barrier around the contract being obtained relates to them\nobtaining the insurance that is required. The CA reported they have narrowed\ndown possible insurance providers, and they should have the insurance needed\nwithin the next 30 days.\nFinancial Overview\nDuring its original licensing process, the agency submitted a projected budget.\nThere has been no changes with that budget in the five months that has passed\nsince the original licensure.\nThe agency has no placements at this time; and they are still pursuing an\nindependent living contract with the department which will generate new revenue.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThe chief administrator and licensee designee both reported being excited about\ngetting the program up and running; and getting independent living youth placed\nwithin the program. They seemed proud of the work they have put in on the\nprogram and look forward to making the program something folks can be proud of.\nThey shared the case manager they have hired, currently is in voluntary status;\nand once they obtain the independent living contract and receive youth\nplacements, this staff person can be a full-time paid staff. I also spoke with this\nstaff person, and she voiced positives about the agency, what she sees as her\npotential role/duties. She also reported that she enjoys working with the youths\nwho are in the host home.\nNo negative concerns were noted by either of these three people.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the facility was completed and it showed no major safety\nconcerns.
