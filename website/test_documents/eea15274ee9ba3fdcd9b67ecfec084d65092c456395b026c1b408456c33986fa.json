Staff 1\nreported he works third shift for the Zondervan home. He reported the home\ncurrently has nine boys on unit. Staff 1 reported the ratio for sleeping hours is one\nstaff member to six youth. Staff 1 reported Zondervan home has not always been\nfollowing that ratio and has been having one staff member to nine youth. Staff 1\nreported he is concerned about being the only staff member during those nights out\nof ratio. Staff 1 reported for the past three months there has only been one staff\nmember working the weekend nights making the unit out of ratio on third shift. He\nalso reported that sporadically throughout the week the unit has been out of ratio on\nthird shift. Staff 1 reported sometimes staff are scheduled to work the third shift but\nwill call off the day of saying they cannot come into work. Staff 1 reported he is\nconcerned of something happening with the youth and he will be out of ratio. Staff 1\nreported he has talked with his supervisor and the human resource department\n2",
    "about the concerns of being out of ratio. He reported he knows that hiring and\nmaintaining staff during the pandemic has been difficult. Staff 1 reported Staff 2\nfilled in last night to make sure that they were in ratio. Staff 1 reported the facility\ntries to fill the open spots, but it does not always happen. Staff 1 said Staff 2 told him\nshe would be available if he needed her on third shift when he is the only staff\nworking. Staff 1 said he appreciates the hard work Staff 2 puts in but if an incident\nwas to occur it would still take her time to drive to facility which makes the situation\nrisky.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on March 3, 2022. Staff 2\nreported she is the house supervisor for the unit. Staff 2 reported the facility has\nbeen having a hard time staffing the third shift. Staff 2 said she has been having a\nstaffing shortage and has been talking with the human resource department about\nthese concerns, especially as it comes to staffing third shift. Staff 2 reported they\ncurrently have nine youth on the unit and for sleeping hours the ratio is one staff to\nsix youth. Staff 2 reported some nights they have been running with one staff\nmember for nine youth, which she is aware is out of ratio. Staff 2 was working the\nthird shift with Staff 1 so that they were in ratio last night and into this morning.\nChief Administrator was interviewed via phone on March 3, 2022. Chief\nAdministrator reported that he was made aware of the recent struggle with staffing\nthird shift at the Zondervan home. Chief Administrator reported he has talked with\nStaff 2 and the Human Resource Department about this. The Chief Administrator\nreported the facility has been having difficulty with hiring staff in general. He also\nreported that there have been some issues with staff being scheduled to work the\nthird shift and would call off the day of the shift. Due to the short notice, it has\ncaused even more difficulty to find coverage. The facility is also seeing staff turnover\nespecially in the night shift area. Chief Administrator reported he is working with\nStaff 2 about what shifts need to be filled and working with the administration team\nto get the coverage taken care. The Chief Administrator plans on getting the\ndocumentation over the past month of night shift staff to youth ratio.\nTour Observation:\nA tour of the facility occurred on March 03, 2022. This consultant completed a\nvisit of the facility around 6:15 am on March 03, 2022. This consultant was able to\nmeet with the third shift staff member. During the visit, nine youth were sleeping\nwithin their rooms and there was two staff members present. One of the staff\nmembers was the home supervisor filling in for a staff member that was unable to\nwork the shift. The facility was in ratio for sleeping hours.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n Zondervan Program Statement- The program statement for the facility reports the\nnighttime staffing ratio is one staff member to every six youth.\n Contract between Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and\nKentwood License- The contract states the contractor must maintain a minimum\nof one on-duty direct care worker for every six youth during sleeping hours.\n3",
    " Staff schedule for Week of February 20, 2022- March 5, 2022: The schedule\nnotes five different days where there is only one third shift member scheduled.\nThe schedule has highlighted marks requesting for staff to fill the open spots.\n Zondervan Daily Census for January 24, 2022-February 27, 2022: The daily\ncensus notes that each night there was at least seven youth sleeping on\nZondervan Unit meaning to be in ratio two staff members should be working.\n Zondervan Timesheet for third shift employees for January 21, 2022-March 4,\n2022- The times sheet shows there was eight shifts out of thirty-three shifts\nwhere the facility only had one third shift staff member working during sleeping\nhours.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The facility is found in noncompliance as they have not been\nmeeting the ratio requirements during sleeping hours. Evidence\nthrough staff interviews and staffing schedules, there was\nevidence showing during sleeping hours there were times where\nonly one staff was working when there were nine youth on the\nunit. The ratio requirement per the contract and program\nstatement is one staff to six students during sleeping hours.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend upon receipt of an acceptable corrective no change be made to the\nlicense status of this child caring institution\nMarch 7, 2022\n___________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 8, 2022\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
