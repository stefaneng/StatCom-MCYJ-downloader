Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nYouth went AWOL from facility. Youth reported they were going to take a shower\nand staff failed to complete required 15-minute check.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n Student Supervision Procedure 2021. The expectation for staff to supervisor\nyouth is outlined in this procedure and includes but is not limited to the\nfollowing expectations:\n2",
    "o YDS staff will complete the Daily Observation Record for each student\nthey are responsible for. The Daily Observation record will be handed\noff to the YDS when the supervision responsibility changes. Staff will\nkeep the Daily Observation Record on their person at all times and\ndocument at varying 15 minute intervals, utilizing the key outlined on\nthe Daily Observation Record. If a student is on At-Risk or Suicide\nStatus, the Status Checklist forms will be used in placed of the Daily\nobservation record. Frequency of checks may be increased during At-\nRisk or Suicide Status. YDS staff must follow all directions located on\nthe status paperwork directed by the clinical team.\no YDS are responsible for the direct supervision of students living in the\nhouse in which they are working. To ensure appropriate supervision,\nYDS and other agency staff responsible for students must:\n a. Know which students are being supervised by which staff at\nall times\n b. Know where each student is at all times\n c. Be physically present in close proximity to the student\n d. Maintain visual contact and monitoring of the student\n e. Monitor interactions between students\n f. Accompany and supervise students whenever they move\naround campus\n g. Clearly communicate when the supervision of student/s\ntransfers to another staff person (example: “you are now\nresponsible for student A because I am leaving the basketball\ncourt to go make dinner”) and ensure the student’s Daily\nObservation Record is transferred to the staff assuming\nsupervision responsibilities.\n h. Ensure hallways are being monitored at all times when\nstudents are in their rooms, den, bathrooms, laundry room,\ncommon hallway space or med cart area. If a staff member\nmust leave their post as direct supervisor of the hallway, they\nwill notify another staff to take over this supervision. Staff will\nposition themselves in common areas where direct line of site of\nhallways can easily be achieved while preventing being\nobtrusive of student’s privacy (i.e. Staff position their seat at the\ntable to be able to monitor both hallways).\n Daily Observation Record for Youth A dated 7/18/2021. Staff 1 completed the\nform from 11:30am until 1:30pm indicating checks were completed at 11:30,\n11:45, 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45, 1:00, and 1:15. Staff 1 documented Youth\nA AWOLed at the 1:30 check.\n Runaway Fact Sheet for Youth A dated 7/18/2021. Youth A’s time of AWOL\nwas 1:29pm. The form is completed with Youth A’s identifying information and\nall contacts that were made after his AWOL.\n Youth A’ incident report dated 7/18/2021 regarding his AWOL. The incident\nreport narrative describes the events leading up to Youth A’s AWOL and how\nit was discovered he was missing.\n3",
    " Video Review from 1pm-1:30pm. The video footage showed Youth A down\nhis hallway sneaking his shoes and bag outside and then leaving the facility\nand leaving the door cracked open slightly. The video footage showed Staff 1\nsitting in the milieu area without visual supervision of Youth A’s hallway. The\nvideo footage showed that the 1:15 check Staff 1 documented as being done\nwas not actually completed as no one checked Youth A at that time.\n Staff 1’s employee file. Staff 1 had appropriate training through the facility and\nwas up to date on his training hours. Staff 1 did have one prior disciplinary\nreport dated 1/30/2021 for Insubordination, failure to follow direction from\nprevious warnings, and failing to obey agency/program policy and/or\nprocedures. Staff 1 was also on a corrective action plan for issues including\nattendance, changing his work schedule without supervisor approval,\nreaching out to administration prior to communicating with his direct\nsupervisor, and struggling with confidence on shift. Staff 1 was on weekly\nsupervision for improvement in his performance.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on July 26, 2021. Staff 1 said he\nhas worked at St. John’s Home Residential for about one and a half years. Staff 1 said\nhe has worked in two different units however confirmed that the supervision polices are\nthe same for both units. Staff 1 confirmed he is aware of and has been trained on the\nexpectations of supervision of youth in the program. Staff 1 said he was supervising\nYouth A on July 18, 2021. Staff 1 said Youth A had asked to make a phone call about\n1pm. Staff 1 said Youth A ended up making several calls during this time as no one was\nanswering his calls. Staff 1 said Youth A was dialing the number’s himself as he has his\ncontact list memorized however Staff 1 said he was not watching the numbers or\ncomparing them to the contact list so could not be sure Youth A was calling approved\npeople off his phone list. Staff 1 said Youth A was not able to get anyone to answer his\ncalls and so asked if he could take a shower. Staff 1 said Youth A’s bathroom door was\nalready open as he had been prepping to take a shower and so Staff 1 walked to the\nmilieu to work on paperwork as Youth A went down the hallway towards his bathroom.\nStaff 1 said he was sitting in the milieu doing paperwork and Supervisor A and\nSupervisor B came into the house and were talking with him. Staff 1 said Supervisor A\nand Supervisor B got up from the milieu area and started to walk towards the den which\nis in the same hallway as Youth A’s bedroom and bathroom. Staff 1 said Supervisor A\nnoticed the exit door at the end of the hallway was slightly ajar and so went to close it\nand do a check on Youth A. Staff 1 said he went down the hallway once Supervisor A\nsaid the door had been opened. Staff 1 said he knocked on the bathroom door to check\non Youth A and there was no response, so he opened the door and Youth A was not in\nthe bathroom. Staff 1 said he, Supervisor A and Supervisor B then proceeded to look for\nYouth A for about an hour but were not able to find Youth A. They completed all the\nAWOL paperwork and calls. Staff 1 said he had been doing checks on Youth A however\nhad missed a 15-minute check and instead had completed the check at the 26 minute\nmark. Staff 1 said he had documented the missed check and said he had been working\non paperwork, talking to supervisors, and had a personal issue that was weighing on his\nmind that day and simply forgot the check. Staff 1 denied falsifying the documentation\nand said he did write the correct times of the checks.\n4",
