    "I interviewed Chief Administrator 1 and Program Manager 1. Allegations and\ndocumentation for this investigation were discussed.\nDue to three separate allegations, each one will be addressed individually:\nAllegation (1) It is alleged that the agency allowed visits to occur with the foster\nchild and biological father when they should not have occurred.\nOn 12/10/20, I interviewed Complainant 1. Complainant 1 reported the biological father\nhad a warrant for his arrest and that visits should never have taken place between\nFoster Child 1 and Parent 1.\nI reviewed an Order After Dispositional Review/Permanency Planning Hearing\ndated 10/2/20. Parenting time is marked as unsupervised and “The department has the\ndiscretion to allow unsupervised or supervised parenting time by its designee”.\nThe court order stated:\nThe child has been in foster care for 15 months of the most recent 22 months\nand the agency should not initiate proceedings to terminate the parental rights to\nthe children for the following compelling reasons: Father was released from\nprison and relocated to the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. He has a job and there\nis the potential for the children to be placed with his relative in Grand Rapids.\nThis is a home he could move into with the girls until such a time as he could find\nhis own place. He has had seven extended visits with the girls and they look\nforward to seeing him…Father is making progress towards reunification and\nadditional time is needed, as services were difficult to obtain due to pandemic.\nI reviewed the following parenting time case notes:\nVideo Conference\n6/11/20: visit was described as “good”\nFace to Face\n6/18/20: Supervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 1.0 hour\n6/23/20: Supervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 1.5 hours\n6/24/20: Supervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 1.5 hours\n6/29/20: Unsupervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 1.5 hours\n7/6/20: Unsupervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 2.0 hours\n7/27/20: Unsupervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 1.5 hours\n8/3/20: Unsupervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 2.0 hours\n8/10/20: Unsupervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 3.0 hours\n8/14-8/16/20: Overnight visit; visit was positive\n8/21-8/23/20: Overnight visit; visit was positive\n4",
    "8/27-9/2/20: Overnight visit; visit was positive\n9/4/20: Supervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 4.0 hours\n9/12/20: Supervised visit; visit was positive, lasted 4.0 hours\n9/19/20: Supervised visit, visit was positive, lasted 2.0 hours\n9/26/20: Supervised visit, visit was positive, lasted 2.0 hours\n10/3/20: Supervised visit, visit was positive, lasted 4.0 hours\n10/10/20: Supervised visit, visit was positive, lasted 2.0 hours\n10/17/20: Unsupervised visit, visit was positive, lasted 4.0 hours\n10/23-10/25/20: Overnight visit, visit was positive\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 on 1/26/21 via telephone. Foster Care Worker 1\nreported there were already successful visits made. Foster Care Worker 1 reported he\nhad just contacted Parent 1’s parole officer on 10/23/20 and Parent 1 was completing\nhis parole as required. Foster Care Worker 1 reported he contacted the parole officer on\n10/15/20 and left a voicemail. The parole officer was changing, and he needed to know\nwho the new parole officer would be. Foster Care Worker 1 reported he spoke to Parent\n1’s therapist on 10/22/20 to check on Parent 1’s status for continuation of visits. Foster\nCare Worker 1 reported the therapist continued to support visits.\nI reviewed case notes from Foster Care Worker 1 to Parole officer concerning\nupdates. Foster Care Worker 1 contacted the parole office on 9/23/20 and 10/15/20.\nI reviewed a Safety Plan dated 10/23/20. The safety plan outlined substance free\nlifestyle during overnight visits, contact case manager in emergencies, no use of\ncorporal punishment, and maintain safety of children while in care. This safety plan was\ndiscussed with Foster Child 1 and Parent 1.\nAllegation (2) It is alleged that the agency did not respond to an emergency as\noutlined in their on-call policy.\nOn 12/10/20, I interviewed Complainant 1. Complainant 1 reported Foster Child 1 was\nvisiting her Parent 1 for a home pass. During that home pass, Parent 1 became\nintoxicated and physically abused Foster Child 1. Complainant 1 reported Foster Care\nWorker 1 was called by the on-call department of New Light agency due to issues\nduring the visit. Foster Care Worker 1 then called Foster Child 1 and conversed with\nher. Due to the ongoing issues with Foster Child 1 and Parent 1, Foster Child 1 left and\nwent to a hotel with her aunt. Parent 1 was to remain in the home. This occurred on\n10/31/20 at 4:38pm. Around 8:05pm, the on-call worker for New Light agency contacted\nFoster Child 1 to ensure she was safe. Complainant 1 reported that Foster Child 1\nreported she was safe. Complainant 1 reported that at 9:23pm, the on-call worker\nreceived a phone call from Foster Child 1 crying and asking to be picked up from her\nvisit. Complainant 1 reported that the police and child protection services went out to the\nhotel due to Foster Child 1 calling the police after she was choked and punched by\n5",
    "Parent 1. Parent 1 had not remained in his home. Instead, he came to the hotel where\nFoster Child 1 was staying. Complainant 1 reported that the on-call worker was unable\nto get a hold of Foster Care Worker 1 to pick up Foster Child 1. The police took Foster\nChild 1 to an aunt’s house. Complainant 1 reported at 10:48pm the on-call worker was\nable to reach Foster Care Worker 1 and they were going to pick up Foster Child 1 and\ntake her from her aunt’s house to the foster home.\nI reviewed the Worker Contact and Monitoring Policy. The policy only addressed\nmissing person protocol. It did not address specific procedures related to on-call general\nemergencies.\nI reviewed the Physical and Mental Health Policy. The policy only addressed medical\nemergencies and on-call interaction. It did not address specific procedures to on-call\ngeneral emergencies.\nI interviewed Licensing Worker 1 on 1/26/21, via telephone. Licensing Worker 1\nreported around 4pm on 10/31/20, Foster Child 1 texted her for Foster Worker 1’s\nphone number. Foster Child 1 reported she wanted Foster Care Worker 1 to come pick\nher up, but would not give a reason. Licensing Worker 1 called Foster Care Worker 1\nand On-Call Worker 1 to relay message. Licensing Worker 1 received a phone call from\nFoster Care Worker 1 updating her that Foster Child 1 was okay and that biological\nparent and Foster Child 1 were going to separate for a while to deescalate. Around\n8:00pm, Foster Care Worker 1 contacted Licensing Worker 1 because he could not get\na hold of Foster Child 1 and wanted to check up on her. Licensing Worker 1 reported\nFoster Care Worker 1 asked her to text Foster Child 1 to determine her wellbeing.\nLicensing Worker 1 reported she texted Foster Child 1 and Foster Child 1 reported she\nwas doing ok. Licensing Worker 1 reported she received a phone call around 9:30pm\nfrom Foster Child 1. Foster Child 1 was crying and there was a police office at the hotel\nwith them. Licensing Worker 1 reported the neither the foster care workers or licensing\nworkers are mandated to work on the weekends. Licensing Worker 1 reported they\nrotate working as the on- call worker. Licensing Worker 1 reported it is the on- call\nworker’s role to be available 24/7 and to connect the emergency with the right support\npersonnel. Those supports could be police, CPS, medical, or New Light’s supervisor.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 on 1/26/21 via telephone. Foster Care Worker 1\nreported visits were going well with the children. At 4pm on 10/31/20, he received a\nphone call from the Parent 1. He was upset due to an argument he had with Foster\nChild 1 and did not know what to do. Foster Worker 1 reported he talked to him and\nhelped him with different parenting ideas. Foster Care Worker 1 discussed separating\nuntil they were both clam and then Foster Care Worker 1 would be there in the morning.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported Parent 1 was deescalated when they hung up the\nphone. Foster Care Worker 1 reported he spoke to Foster Child 1 at 4:35pm and she\nreported she was ok. At 7:00pm, Foster Care Worker 1 reported Foster Child 1 went to\na hotel with her aunt and cousins to hang out. At 8:00pm Foster Care Worker 1 asked\nLicensing Worker 1 to check on Foster Child 1 to make sure she arrived at the hotel.\nAfter 8:00pm, Foster Worker 1 received a text from Foster Child 1. The text contained a\n6",
    "video of Parent 1 drinking. Foster Care Worker 1 reported around 8:30 he received a\nphone call from the police reporting their involvement with Foster Child 1. Foster Care\nWorker 1 reported he went with his supervisor to pick Foster Child 1 up.\nI reviewed incident reports from Licensing Worker 1, Foster Care Worker 1, and On Call\nWorker 1. All incident reports are congruent with the events described.\nAllegation (3) (1) It is alleged that the agency did not cooperate with CPS as\noutlined in the agency policy.\nComplainant 1 reported New Light did not cooperate with the Maltreatment in Care\ninvestigation initiated on 10/31/20. Complainant 1 reported they did not provide them\nwith phone calls or information concerning the aunt of the Foster Child 1.\nI requested the New Light policy pertaining to 1975 PA 238. Program Manager 1\nreported they do not have a policy outlining this.\nI reviewed CPS Report Case 1996282770. Case notes indicate successful contact was\nmade to New Light on the following dates:\n11/2/20: Interview with Foster Care Worker 1\n11/3/20: Email from Foster Care Worker 1 to MIC providing requested information.\n11/13/20: Successful phone contact to Foster Care Worker 1\n11/16/20: Successful phone contact to Foster Care Worker 1\n11/17/20: Foster Care Worker 1 and Program Manager 1 were present for disposition\nconference\n11/19/20: Successful phone contact with Foster Care Worker 1\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 and Program Manager1. Both reported cooperating\nwith MIC and providing information that was requested.\nProgram Manager 1 reported during a Child Stat review on 1/6/21, MIC did not have the\nsame amount of information that the agency had when presenting to the review board.\nProgram Manager 1 reported this was unsettling to the review board. This difference\nwas due to the agency supervising the case and being apart of all aspects of the case.\n7",
