An\nunannounced visit was made to the facility. Upon arrival, the staff was advised that I\nwas present for the initiation of a complaint investigation. The chief administrator\nwas not in the building, however Staff A agreed to meet with this worker.\nAn interview was held with the Staff A. She identified herself as a case manager and\ntook me on a tour of the facility. I was able to see both Units two and three that were\nbeing occupied at the time. Some residents and staff were also in the cafeteria for\ndinner.

Both youth reported to staff that the activity\noccurred while in Unit two on Saturday October 9, 2021.

She reports that there was a second staff person in\nthe unit with her and there was a total of ten residents in the unit. She did not recall\nthen name of the second staff that was present. Staff B acknowledged that she\nallowed the residents to braid her hair and confirmed that both Youth A and Youth B\nwere standing behind her and braiding her hair while in the unit.

    "statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: Upon completion of the investigation, sufficient evidence was\nfound to confirm that agency staff failed to provide adequate\nsupervision of residents to ensure safety. The staff engaged in\nactivity that failed to allow “line of sight” supervision to be\nmaintained. As a result, the agency is found in violation of the\nrule.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\n12/21/2021\n________________________________________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
