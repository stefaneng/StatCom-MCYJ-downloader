    "Staff Files: Per Division Director, there is no discipline records for\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 on file. Staff 1 did not complete Non-Violent\nCrisis Physical Intervention (CPI training) and is scheduled to\ncomplete in September. Staff 2 completed Non-Violent Crisis\nPhysical Intervention (CPI) training on 11/12/24.\nUnusual Incident Report for Youth B 07/24/2025 authored by\nStaff 2 and Supervisor. Incident Report is consistent with all\ninterviews.\nBehavior Management Philosophy: Spectrum staff must use\nde-escalation techniques to present behavior management, which\nis only used to keep everyone safe. If needed, law enforcement\nwill be contacted. Approved methods include time-outs and non-\nphysical interventions.\nSupervision and Security Policy:\nMental Health Behavioral Stabilization (MHBS) Program\nMHBS sites have 24/7 direct care staff who maintain line of sight\nand proper staff-to-consumer ratios. Staff monitor youth behavior,\ndaily routines, and safety, ensuring all youth are accounted for.\nSafety plans for at-risk youth are created, reviewed, and followed\nby the team. In emergencies, police are contacted and missing\nyouth reports are filed immediately. Staff follow universal\nprecautions and keep the environment safe and clean. Emergency\ncontacts are always accessible. The MHBS team documents\nincidents and receives ongoing training in crisis prevention and\nintervention.\nBehavior Management Policy & Procedures:\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of the Residential Programs do not use corporal\npunishment or physical restraint. Youth Residential Services\nstress the importance of attempting to employ verbal de-\nescalation as a first response to physically aggressive behavior.\nStaff will utilize approved crisis prevention techniques, i.e.,\nprevention, de-escalation techniques, escorting, and non-violent\nresponses to assaultive behavior, which includes a trauma-\ninformed approach. If such efforts are ineffective local law\nenforcement is contacted.\nPROCEDURE(S): Spectrum doesn’t use corporal punishment,\nseclusion, and do not use any physical management unless in an\nextreme emergency situation.\n7",
    "All employees receive initial and ongoing Non-Violent Crisis\nPhysical Intervention (CPI) training. Spectrum staff use conflict\nresolution and crisis prevention to avoid formal behavior\nmanagement, which is only used to ensure consumer safety.\nSpectrum does not use corporal punishment or physical restraint.\nBehavior management emphasizes consumer rights and positive\nprogramming to support growth. When preventive measures fail,\nlocal law enforcement is contacted. Authorized techniques include\ntime-outs (non-restrictive and voluntary), non-physical\ninterventions, clear communication of expectations, positive\nreinforcement, non-verbal cues, and physical proximity to redirect\nbehavior. Time-outs are brief, voluntary breaks from the group,\nlimited to 15 minutes and twice per day, aimed at helping youth\ndevelop self-management skills.\nAnalysis The agency was found to be in non-compliance based on video\nreview. Staff 1 failed to utilize effective verbal de-escalation\ntechniques and was observed stating, \"let them fight.\" Additionally,\nStaff 1 had not received the training required by the agency’s\npolicy. These failures contributed to a prolonged physical\naltercation between Youth A and Youth B.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n______________________________________09///10/2025\nErica Marshall Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n09/15/2025\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n8"
