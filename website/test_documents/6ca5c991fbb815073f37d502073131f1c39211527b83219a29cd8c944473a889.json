This\nperiod under review began at the beginning of the COVID pandemic which impacted\nthe way staff had to do their work. Several of the items cited were due to lack of\n12",

The agency was able\nto provide verification after the inspection that face to face with youth following return\nhome and replacement occurred, but the worker failed to input the information into\nMiSACWIS.\nVII. DCWL FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or policy. Upon receipt\nof an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be\nissued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 23, 2021\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 24, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n13"
