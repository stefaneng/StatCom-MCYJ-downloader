    "III. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\n1.) The facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules\nexcept for the following:\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(1) An agency shall do all of the following when anyone in\nthe agency receives information that relates to possible\nnoncompliance with any foster home rule:\n(a) Submit a special investigation record to the\ndepartment's licensing authority within 5 working days in\nthe manner prescribed by the department.\nOne of the two special evaluations reviewed indicated the record was not submitted\nwithin the time frame established by this rule. In this example the intake date\nwas7/31/2020 and the information was not submitted to the department’s licensing\nauthority until 08/220/2020. The information was logged into the information system\non 08/03/2020 and the evaluation was also initiated within that time. The delay in\nthe submission to the licensing authority was due to a medical emergency for the\nsupervisor. The information was submitted upon the supervisor’s return.\nR 400.12327 Special evaluation.\n(5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an\nagency shall complete a written report that includes all of\nthe following information:\n(d) Dates and places of contacts, names of persons\ninterviewed, and names of the interviewers. If children are\ninterviewed, their last names shall not be included in the\nreport.\nOne of the two special evaluations reviewed contained the last name of a foster child\nthat was placed in the home. This occurred in one location within the report and was\ndue to the information system automatically migrating that information into the report\nfrom another location within the information system, and the worker did not delete\nthe last name during their review of the evaluation report.\nR 400.12405 Change of placement.\n(4) If an emergency change in placement is necessary, then all\nof the documentation required in subrules (2) and (3) of this rule\nshall be in the child's record within 14 calendar days after the\nchange in placement.\n4",
    "One of the two discharged youth did not have the documentation completed/located\nin the information system within the time frame established by this rule. The youth\nhad an identified discharge date of 02/18/2020 and the form to document this\ninformation was dated 11/24/2020. This is a repeat noncompliance from the\nrenewal evaluation completed 06/14/2019.\nR 400.12418 Development of service plans.\n(2) An agency shall complete written service plans for each child\nand parent or parents, as follows:\n(a) Within 30 calendar days from removal from the home.\nOne of the six current foster child records reviewed contained an initial service plan\nthat was completed outside the time frame established by this rule. In this example\nthe initial service plan for the time period 08/21/2020 to 09/19/2020 was completed\n09/23/2020.\n2.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also an MISEP violation. Please note that\nthere are additional MISEP requirements that may not be included in section 1.\nThe facility is in compliance will all additional MISEP requirements except for the\nfollowing:\nISEP 6.49 – Page 34 Medical Passports (Commitment 85).\n(a) At the time the child is placed or re-placed, the foster care provider shall\nreceive the child’s Medical Passport, which must contain the information\nrequired by MCL 722.954c(2) and DHHS Policy FOM 801 (dated 3-1-2015) (or\nany successor policies approved by the Monitors).

Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation. Please note\nthat there are additional DHS Contract/Policy requirements that may not be\nincluded in section 1. The facility is in compliance will all additional DHS\nContract/Policy requirements except for the following:\nIV.
