INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207 Staff Responsibilities.\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency failed to complete the court's 11/2/2022 order related\nto exploring and establishing a way for an incarcerated\nrespondent father to have contact with his child who is Native\nAmerican. An exploration of a way for the father/child visitation to\noccur and sharing of photos with this father was to occur by the\nJanuary 2023 court date.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant X\nOn 4/11/2023 I spoke with Complainant X by telephone.\nComplainant X reported this case relates to a Native American\nchild, Child A whose father, Parent B is incarcerated. Complainant\nX reported at a court hearing in November 2022, the court ordered\nChild and Family Services of Northwestern Michigan (CFSNWM)\nand to send photos of Child A to Parent B, and to establish a way\nfor Parent B to have contact with Child A by the next court date on\n1/30/2023. Complainant X reported at the January 2023 court\nhearing, the agency had not done what was ordered by the court;\nand the agency had no reason as to why it had not complied.\nComplainant X reported the worker did not contact Parent B at all\n2",
    "about this matter during the period of 11/2/2022 and 1/30/2023.\nAdditionally, that despite there being supervisory meetings with\nthe worker; this lack of follow through and compliance with the\ncourt order was not caught by the agency. Complainant X\nreported this was an egregious act even if it had not involved an\nIndian child.\nChief Administrator 1\nOn 4/19/2023 I spoke with Chief Administrator (CA) 1 by\ntelephone about the allegations. CA 1 affirmed that the case in\nquestion was with CFSNWM. I advised her that per my review of\nthe case in MISACWIS, it did not show contacts with the prison or\nParent B related parent/child visitations as alleged in the\ncomplaint. Nor documentation that photos of Child A had been\nprovided to Parent B by the required due date. CA 1 reported she\nknew there had been a problem, but she thought that the worker\nhad made attempts to contact the prison. She was not certain of\nthat but reported the situation has since been rectify.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)3\nOn 4/28/2023 I interviewed FCW 3 by telephone. FCW 3\nacknowledged being the worker on the case for Child A and\nParent B. She also admitted the allegations were true. As to why\nthe actions as ordered by the court had not been completed prior\nto the January 2023 court hearing, FCW 3 reported she could only\nsay it was due to being a new worker and poor communication\nbetween she and her supervisor. She reported she was not sure\nwhat she was to do, or how to go about doing it. She reported the\nrequired actions have since been completed, and the matter is\nresolved.\nDocument Review\nA 11/2/2022 Court Order as provided by Complainant X which\nshowed what was ordered, as indicated in the complaint.\nChild A’s MISACWIC case record, (inclusive of a 9/20/2022-\n12/18/2022 and 12/19/2022-3/17/2023 Updated Service Plan)\nwhich showed:\n• Child A is a 1 ½ year old Native American child who\nentered care on 8/28/2021.\n• Child A is a temporary court ward. He was placed with\nCFSNWM on 12/14/2021.\n• FCW 3 was assigned to Child A’s case 10/21/2022.\n• Aside from a 11/14/2022 social work contact showing a\ncontact from Parent B to FCW 3 related to a workbook\nfrom a prior worker, and 12/30/2022 social work contact by\n3",
    "FCW of a December contact not occurring, no contacts\nwere documented to Parent B, or the correctional facility\nhe is incarcerated until 1/30/2023 and thereafter.\n• No documentation of efforts by the FCW 3 or the agency\nto explore/ establish parent/child visitation between Parent\nB and Child A. Nor that the agency provided photos of\nChild A to Parent B until after the fact.\n• FCW 3 reached out to the correction facility on 1/30/2023.\n• Photos were provided to Parent B of Child A later in\nFebruary 2023. A 2/27/2023 social work contact by FCW 3\ninquired to Parent B whether he had received the photos\nsent.\n• A 3/14/2023 social work contact where FCW 3 reached\nout to a prison representative by email to verify when video\nvisitation could be scheduled for Child A with Parent B.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and the documents reviewed, the evidence\nsupports the allegations, and a lack of direct work by the\nagency/worker with the child, their family, and relevant individuals\nrelated to implementation of the service plan.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptance corrective action plan, continuation of the agency’s\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\nApril 28, 2023\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
