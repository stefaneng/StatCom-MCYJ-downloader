Find out how much time that the baby spends with the fictive kin since the relative\ncare giver seemed to think that the baby resides with the fictive kin. Please provide\ninformation regarding this in the alert.\n5. Address with the family the fact that no one should allow the baby to go with the\nbiological mother.
