    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(iii)Threats of restraint, seclusion, punishment, or otherwise\nsuggesting physical or emotional harm to a youth.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff 1 told Youth A and Youth S she would beat their asses if\nthey were her kids. Staff 1 cocked her hand back as if she would\nstrike Youth B.\nInvestigation Interviews\nI notified Youth A’s and Youth S’ Foster Care Workers of the\ninvestigation assignment. They expressed no additional licensing\nconcerns. I asked Youth S’ Foster Care Worker not to discuss the\nallegations with Youth S, but she had already discussed them.\nI interviewed Complainant/Rights Officer via phone on 2/23/24.\nHe had no additional information or concerns.\nI interviewed Youth A with Rights Officer present. She has been\nat the facility for six months. Youth A said Staff 1 called her a\n“coward” and “said if I wanted to fight her, we could go in my room\nand close the door.” Youth A said Staff 1 was not serious about\nfighting her and she is not afraid of Staff 1 because, “We play like\nthat.” Afterward Youth A said Staff 1 apologized if she offended\nher.\nI interviewed Youth S with Rights Officer present. She has been\nat the facility for two weeks. Youth S said “Staff 1 threatened me,\nsaid we were on her ‘hit’ list and called us cowards. Youth S said\nshe feels disliked by Staff 1 but does not feel scared. “She called\nme a ‘pussy,’ said ‘I’d beat your ass if you were my kid’ then\ncocked her hand back and gave me a hug.”\nI interviewed Staff 1 via Teams with Rights Officer present. She\nhas worked midnight shift at Vista Maria for seven months and\nhas limited contact with the youths unless she picks up overtime\n2",
    "on dayshift. Asked if Staff 1 called Youth A a coward, she\nclarified, “I never called her a coward. I told her that jumping\nsomeone is a coward move. Youth A agreed I was right...I never\nthreatened to take her in her room and jump her.”\nI asked Staff 1 if she and Youth A play and tease each other.\nStaff 1 affirmed that they play, color and talk. “Youth A will say if I\ndon’t give her a hug, she’ll throw water or take my backpack,” and\nlaughed. “She tries to get me to interact with her.” I asked why\nYouth A threatening to throw water was funny. Staff 1 responded,\n“It’s funny because I know Youth A won’t do it. That’s the bond\nwe have.”\nI asked about how she relates with Youth S, Staff 1 said “I don’t\nknow her (Youth S) to play or joke like that, but I do (know) the\nother girls” and denied telling either girl they were on her “hit” list.\nStaff 1 stated “I told her it was a coward move. She asked me if I\nhad kids and what I would do if they jumped someone. I told her\nI’d whip my kids. I suggested she pray, and she thanked me. We\nhugged…” Staff 1 denied cocking her hand back or calling Youth\nS a “pussy” because “I don’t know her well enough to play with her\nlike that.” When Staff 1 heard Youth A and Youth S were\noffended by the interactions, she said it was a “wake-up call” and\nshe felt hurt. Staff 1 said apologized to each of them separately\n“because that was not my intent.”\nDocuments reviewed:\nThere were no incident reports written regarding the verbal\ninteractions with Staff 1 as described by Youth A and Youth S.\nAnalysis Staff 1 is a newer staff who works midnight shift and has very little\ndirect contact with the youths. There is no evidence she\nthreatened physical harm or spoke in a derogatory manner to the\nyouths. However, she did respond to a hypothetical question\nposed by the youth that was taken out of context. Staff 1 did\nadmit she feels comfortable teasing and joking around with certain\nyouths she has developed a rapport with.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nI advised Staff 1 against teasing, engaging in verbal “play”,\nsharing personal information with, and responding to hypothetical\nsituations presented by youth. I asked her to review her staff\ntraining materials related to setting and maintaining professional\nboundaries.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nMarch 5, 2024\n____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 21, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
