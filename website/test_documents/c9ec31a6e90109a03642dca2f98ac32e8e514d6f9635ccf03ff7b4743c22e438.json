    "II. Purpose of Addendum\nLutheran Social Services of MI- Jackson has requested approval to move to a new\noffice at:\nSte 200\n729 W. Michigan Ave.\nJackson, MI 49201\nIn addition, the agency director, Diana Ripley, advised that their satellite office\nlocated in Ann Arbor will no longer be designated under this license.\nIII. Methodology\nMs. Ripley assisted with an on-site walk through of the new office space on\n10/13/2014. Ms. Ripley reported an implementation date of 10/20/2014 for the\nplanned move.\nIV. Description of Findings and Conclusions\nThe proposed office space has ample offices and cubicles for staff, visitation rooms\nand meeting rooms, and secured storage rooms for file storage. The agency has\nrenovated the space and put in new furniture, carpet and paint. The doors\nthroughout will be secured and accessible via staff swipe cards. The agency is also\nin the process of having an elevator installed to make the space handicap\naccessible, as they are on the second floor. Although there are currently no\nidentified individuals (children, families, foster parents, etc) in need of an elevator,\nthe agency has developed a contingency plan should this need arise. Ms. Ripley\nhas an agreement with the church directly next door, who has agreed to allow\naccess to their building which is handicap accessible until the elevator is operable.\nThe building is more than sufficient for providing the services offered by the agency.\nV. Recommendation\nI recommend the agency move to the new location in Jackson be approved. In\naddition this license will no longer have the Ann Arbor branch under their domain.\nOctober 22, 2014\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2"
