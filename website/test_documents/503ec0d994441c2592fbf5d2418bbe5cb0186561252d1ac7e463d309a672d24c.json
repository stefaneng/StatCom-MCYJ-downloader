    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 12/26/23, Staff 2 slammed the door on Youth A’s finger during\na lock down. The door cut the tip of the youth's finger off and\nyouth was transported to the emergency room where the fingertip\nwas sewn back on. It is unknown if it will remain viable.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n01/03/2024.\nInterviews:\nI contacted complainant via telephone on 01/03/2024, no\nadditional information was provided.\nI interviewed Manager at the facility on 01/03/2024. Manager is the\nfacility’s certified restraint instructor, and they use the Crisis\nPrevention Institute’s Nonviolent Physical Crisis Intervention\nmodel (CPI). He reported on 12/26/2023 Youth A was agitated\nbecause him and Youth B had been going back and forth earlier in\nthe evening. Staff moved Youth A and Youth C to a classroom with\nStaff 3 until around 9:30 pm. Youth A came back on the pod and was\ntold to go to his room. Youth A went to his room willing, but when\nStaff 2 closed the door, Youth A stuck his finger in the door and his\nfinger was injured. Youth A was taken to the hospital and his finger\nwas sutured. The Manager was not onsite when this incident\noccurred, but the incident was reviewed and discussed. He\nreviewed video footage of the incident and Youth A was observed\nwalking into his room willingly without staff assistance.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 01/03/2024. Youth A has been\nat the facility for one month. Youth A’s hand was observed, and his\nmiddle finger was wrapped with dressing and a splinter. Youth A\nreported he injured his finger last week by sticking his finger in the\ndoor to jam the locks when staff closed his bedroom door. He\nreported Staff 1 pushed him in his room, he then stuck his finger in\nthe door, trying to jam the door, and that’s when staff slammed the\ndoor on his finger. Youth A could not recall which staff member\nclosed the door. Youth A said there were several staff members on\nthe pod, Staff 2 opened the door immediately and Staff 3 wrapped his\nfinger and called EMS. His finger was stitched, x-rayed, and wrapped.\nHe denied having any discomfort or being in pain.\n2",
    "I interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 01/03/2024. Staff 1 is a Coach\nCounselor and has been working at the facility for two months. Staff 1\nhas completed all training including CPI. Staff 1 reported on 12/26/23,\nYouth A returned to the pod around 9:30 pm. Youth A was told it was\ntime to turn in and needed to go to his room, Youth A walked into his\nroom and a few minutes later walked out. Youth A was redirected to\ngo back to his room, but he was agitated because of an earlier\nincident with Youth B. He and Staff 2 talked with Youth A and\nconvinced him to go back to his room. Youth A walked back to his\nroom, sat on his bed, he and Staff 2 walked out of the room and Staff\n2 closed the door. He heard Youth A yell after they closed the door,\nso they opened the door and saw Youth A had injured his finger.\nThey immediately attended to Youth A’s hand and Youth A was taken\nto the hospital. He denied pushing Youth A or physically managing\nYouth A. He said Youth A walked into his room without any\nassistance.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 01/03/2024. Staff 2 has been\nworking at the facility for two months. Staff 2 reported on 12/26/2023\nYouth A was escalated because of an earlier incident with another\nYouth B. Youth A was told it was time to go to his room, but he\nrefused. He and Staff 1 verbally redirected Youth A and after a few\nminutes, Youth A walked back to his room. Youth A sat on his bed\nand Staff 2 and Staff 1 walked out of the bedroom and closed the\ndoor. He denied seeing Youth A stick his finger in the door and\ndenied staff physically managed Youth A. He said Youth A walked\ninto his room willingly. Staff 2 said Youth A told him after the incident\nthat he stuck his finger in the door to jam the lock, because Youth A\ndid this at his previous placement.\nI interviewed Staff 3 at the facility on 01/03/2024. Staff 3 reported he\ngot to the unit right when Staff 2 closed Youth A’s door. He heard\nYouth A say his finger was bleeding and Staff 2 immediately opened\nthe door. Staff 3 grabbed the first aid kit and wrapped Youth A’s finger\nuntil EMS arrived and transported Youth A to the hospital.\nI spoke with Youth A’s JJ Worker via telephone on 01/09/2024. JJ\nWorker reported the agency communicates well and provides\nupdates on Youth A’s behavior. She said Youth A has a lot of\nanger issues and has assaulted staff and other residents since\nplacement at the facility. She expressed no concerns regarding\nthe facility or staff.\n3",
    "Video Footage Reviewed:\nVideo footage from 12/26/2023 at approximately 9:25 pm was\nreviewed (Note: there is no audio). Youth B is viewed walking to\nhis room, there was one staff following behind him and another\nstaff walking besides him. Youth A goes into his room and a few\nseconds later, walks out of his room. Youth A walks around the\npod for a couple minutes with staff members appearing to be\ntalking to him. Youth A walks back to his room and two staff\nmembers stand in the doorway for a few seconds and then they\nclose the bedroom door.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 12/26/2023 completed by Staff 1.\nReport was consistent with Staff 1 and Staff 2’s interview\nand the Manager’s report.\n• Medical report from McLaren Macomb Hospital dated\n12/26/2023. Youth A’s left middle finger was treated for\npartial traumatic amputation.
