INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nDescription supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval checks\nshall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff are not completing eye-on variable interval room checks in\nreal time.\nInvestigation DCWL received these allegations reported by Complainant on\n9/20/23.\nI contacted Complainant on 9/20/23 via telephone. He was hired\nas a direct care worker at the facility in August 2023 and had not\ndecided if he would return to work or resign. Complainant said\n2",
    "when he worked with Staff 1 and 2, they did not check the youth’s\nrooms during reflection time (13:45 – 14:30) so he had to do it.\nI reviewed room check logs dated 9/1/23, 9/2/23, 9/7/23, 9/16/23\nand 9/17/23 when Staff 1, Staff 2 and/or Complainant worked.\nThe logs showed room checks were completed during reflection\ntime.\nI interviewed Staff 8 jointly with Government Worker. She has\nworked at the facility for three months. To her knowledge, she\nsaid staff perform eye on variable room checks when youths are in\ntheir rooms unsupervised during “reflection time.”\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker. She\nsaid youths go into their rooms for bed on afternoon shift at 8pm.\nand midnight shift starts at 10pm. Supervisor said she rounds the\npods and sometimes sees the staff performing their required eye-\non variable interval room checks. “When staff see me, they get up\nright away to do checks,” she laughed. As a trainer Supervisor\nsaid she understands and trains staff on the licensing rule\nrequiring eye-on variable interval checks.\nI interviewed Director jointly with Government Worker. She has\nbeen the director for one year. Director said her internal\nmonitoring process includes viewing video every other day of the\nlate afternoon and midnight shifts to assure staff are completing\ntheir room checks at appropriate intervals.\nAt my request, for this specific investigation, Director spent time\non 9/26/23 viewing video of the afternoon and midnight shifts that\nStaff 1 and/or 2 worked for the period of 9/1/23 – 9/18/23 and\nreported that all room checks were completed.\nI showed up on-site again on 10/27/23 and asked to see video of\nStaff 1 and 2 completing room checks during the time frame\npreviously viewed by Director. I was informed Lincoln Center’s\nvideo saves for 60 days. I was unable to view the video because\nthe facility was experiencing technical difficulty and all footage for\nthe month of September was missing, which was verified. As of\n10/30/23 Director still was unable to recover the footage.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Room check logs dated 9/1/23, 9/2/23, 9/7/23, 9/16/23 and\n9/17/23 showed room checks were completed appropriately\nduring reflection time.\n3",
    "Director has an ongoing process of viewing video to assure staff\nare completing eye on variable interval room checks. Based on\nroom check logs, and video footage viewed by Director, there was\nno evidence the staff identified failed to perform variable interval\nroom checks in between 9/1/23 – 9/18/23.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to\nSection requirements; staff qualifications.\nDescription (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff sleep during their shift and falsify room check\ndocumentation.\nInvestigation Complainant said Staff 2 told him she sleeps when she works the\nmidnight shift, and that multiple other unidentified staff advised\nhim to work midnights so he can sleep. When Complainant\narrives for dayshift at 6am, he said he has found Staff 1 asleep.\nComplainant said he has seen Staff 1, 2 and 3 completing their\nroom check documentation (pink sheets) before or after their\nshifts, and not in real time.\nI reviewed room check logs dated 9/1/23, 9/2/23, 9/7/23, 9/16/23\nand 9/17/23 when Complainant, Staff 1, Staff 2 and/or Staff 3\nworked. The documentation was completed appropriately and\nthere were no signs it was falsified.\nSupervisor told me Director reviews the video regularly and\nrecently terminated Supervisor 2 for falsifying documents.\nDirector said her internal monitoring process includes viewing\nvideo every other day of late afternoon and midnight shifts to\nassure staff are alert and performing room checks. She said she\ntakes room checks seriously and recently terminated Supervisor 2\nfor prefilling his initials on room check sheets before the actual\nroom checks occurred.\nFor this specific investigation, at my request, Director viewed\nvideo of the midnight shifts that Staff 1 and/or Staff 2 worked for\n4",
    "the period of 9/1/23 – 9/18/23 and attested that both staff were\nalert throughout their shifts.\nI showed up on-site again on 10/27/23 and asked to see video of\nStaff 1 and 2 completing room checks during the time frame\npreviously viewed by Director. The facility was experiencing\ntechnical difficulties, which was verified, and video footage was\nunavailable for the month of September 2023. The footage was\nstill unavailable as of 10/30/23.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis The facility has an internal process of viewing video every other\nday to assure staff are alert during their shift and performing room\nchecks. Based on room check logs and the video footage viewed\nby Director, there is no evidence that Staff 1, 2 or 3 slept during\ntheir shifts or falsified room check documents between 9/1/23 –\n9/18/23.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4109 Program statement.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents’ needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation a) Staff violated policy by failing to search Youth T’s room or\nperson after he stabbed Staff 7 with a stolen pen on 9/18/23.\nb) Staff violate policy by allowing youths to trade food on Pod G.\nInvestigation Allegation a):\nOn 9/18/23 Complainant said he and Staff 4 were working\nafternoon shift on Pod F. Youth T ran up to him, grabbed a pen\nfrom his shirt pocket and scratched him with it causing him to\nbleed “slightly.” Complainant clarified the youth “scratched” him\nwith the pen, not “stabbed” him. Supervisor arrived, minimized\nthe incident and did not take the pen from the youth.\n5",
    "I attempted to interview Youth T jointly with Government Worker.\nYouth T refused to be interviewed.\nI interviewed Staff 4 via phone on 10/30/23. She has worked at\nthe facility for four months. Staff 4 said she saw Youth T take\nComplainant’s pen from his shirt pocket. “He told me Youth T\nscratched him with it and he was going to write him up.\nComplainant got a bandage and showed me a dot of blood on his\narm.”\nI asked Staff 4 if anyone searched or confiscated the pen from\nYouth T. She did not know. “I believe we did it…I’m pretty sure\nwe took it…I don’t know. I probably didn’t get it.”\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker. She has\nworked at the facility over three years, is a trainer and supervises\nthe direct care staff on afternoon shift. During her shift,\nSupervisor said she rounds all of the pods and shows support to\nthe staff.\nOn 9/18/23 Supervisor said she was called to the pod and\nComplainant told her Youth T had taken his pen. He did not tell\nher the youth scratched him with it. “I started to go get the pen\nfrom Youth T, but Complainant told me ‘No, I don’t want Youth T\nto be mad.’” Supervisor agreed to downplay the incident and\ncircle back to it later. “I came back later and built up a discussion\nwith Youth T to get the pen but was unsuccessful. I told Staff 4 to\nmake sure they searched the rooms during shower time (per\nroutine).”\nI asked Supervisor if all room and person searches are\ndocumented. She stated, “They (staff) don’t write it down, but\nused to.” Supervisor said pens are not considered contraband per\nse. Youth T, specifically, was not allowed a pen due to his level,\nbut some youths are allowed to have them.\nSupervisor did not know if Complainant’s pen was ever recovered\nfrom Youth T that night. She said she thought it was important to\nhonor Complainant’s request not to immediately and overtly\nsearch for the pen as not to upset Youth T.\nI reviewed the Resident Search Policy dated 7/29/13. It indicates\n“Shift Supervisors must search each resident “when there is\nreasonable basis to believe the resident possesses contraband.”\nItems that are considered contraband were not listed in this policy.\n6",
    "On 10/24/23 I reviewed another untitled document that identifies\npens as contraband and indicates: “Possession of contraband is\nprohibited. Any unauthorized items in your possession or in your\nroom will be considered contraband. Contraband includes any\nitem out of its designated area or any item that is prohibited to you\nby program rules or treatment staff, such as but not limited to,\nmatches, lighters, cigarettes, food, pens, pencils, silverware,\nweapons, combs, etc. Your room will be searched by staff on a\nregular basis.”\nIt should be noted that Lincoln Center presently has a CAP in\nprogress for SIR 2023C0000484 which indicates staff will be\nretrained to document all room searches by 9/30/23.\nAllegation b):\nComplainant said Supervisor informed him there is a policy that\nstates youths are not allowed to trade food/snacks yet Staff 1, 2\nand 3 let youths trade food without imposing consequences.\nSupervisor clarified that “no trading” between youths is a youth\nrule, not a staff policy. Rather “trading” is a negative behavior that\nmay subject youths to consequences. She said she is aware that\nstaff do not always consequent youths for sharing or trading\nsnacks, but she does encourage them to enforce youth rules.\nAdditionally, Supervisor stated there is no policy that indicates\nstaff cannot give extra food to the youths at mealtime “but we\ndiscourage it because of favoritism.”\nDirector also confirmed that staff are discouraged from giving\nextra food at mealtime and while youth should not trade food, staff\nhave discretion on whether or not to impose consequences for\ntrading.\nI reviewed the Discipline policy. It lists trading items such as\nfood/snacks as a misdemeanor rule violation. The policy says:\n“Youth may be disciplined only in accordance with this policy.\nYouth workers may impose disciplinary consequences for rule\nviolations at their own discretion. Youth workers may impose\ndisciplinary consequences for misdemeanor rule violations…only\nwith the review and approval of the Shift Supervisor.”\nOther misdemeanor rule violations include gang activity, self-\nharm, possession of contraband, defacing or misusing property,\nstealing, threatening the safety of others, intimidating, bullying, not\n7",
    "completing disciplinary assignments, encouraging inappropriate\nbehavior in others, and continued negative behaviors that show a\nlack of self-discipline.\nConsequences for misdemeanor rule violations include a verbal\napology to the person or group for your self-defeating behavior\nand lack of self-control, a written acceptable apology letter posted\nin your pod for 3 days, a written Rational Thinking Paper\nassignment related to your offense and one or two of the\nfollowing:\n1) A loss of free time recreation privileges for 3 days\n2) A loss of Merit Store purchases for 3 days.\n3) Assignment to Thinking Table for 3 days to complete\nadditional Rational Thinking Reports. See definition in the\nhandbook.\n4) Cleanup duties for 3 days.\n5) Return to Level One Merit System Privileges for 5 days.\n6) Restitution to the person(s) wronged by your behavior or\nRestorative Justice Project community (pod).\nDisciplinary records for misdemeanors will become part of your\npermanent record (written and electronic) and may be used in\ncourt reports and reports to your family and Community Case\nManager.”\nFor more information pertaining to a specific incident involving one\nyouth allegedly being bullied into giving another youth his food,\nsee concurrent SIR 2023C0000787 by Consultant 2.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Allegation a): Supervisor was aware that Youth T stole a pen\nfrom Complainant and was not allowed to have a pen. Supervisor\ndid not search for or attempt to confiscate the pen which was\nconsidered contraband for Youth T due to his level. Failing to\nsearch Youth T for known contraband was a violation of the\nResident Search Policy. (Violation established)\nAllegation b): While staff are discouraged from doing it, there is\nno policy that states they cannot give youth extra food at\nmealtime.\nThe Discipline Policy indicates staff may consequent youths for\ntrading at their discretion. If Staff 1, 2 or 3 did give extra food\nand/or failed to consequent youths for trading, it is not a policy\nviolation. (Violation not established)\n8",
    "CONSULTATION\nIn terms of staff enforcing rules, imposing consequences and\ndocumenting it, the facility would benefit from developing clearer\nguidelines and expectations for staff to promote consistency.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for the\ncontinual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation a) Complainant believes Youth J is cognitively impaired.\nComplainant heard a rumor that Youth J was gang raped in her\nroom by unidentified youths in August 2023.\nb) Youths fought on 9/6/23 and it is unknown how or if staff\nintervened.\nc) A youth is bullying other youths and taking their snacks. It is\nunknown if staff are aware.\nInvestigation Allegation a):\nA social work contact in MISACWIS intake #104669391 indicated\nFacility Manager was contacted on 9/20/23 by centralized intake\nand said Youth J was at another facility prior to being admitted to\nLincoln Cener. Facility Manager reported Youth J is assigned\none-to-one staffing at Lincoln Center and does not interact with\npeers. He denied Youth J was raped at Lincoln Center and did\nnot know any additional details regarding an alleged rape.\nI spoke with Government Worker 2. She said she did a well-being\ncheck of Youth J on 9/20/23 and Youth J refused to talk to her.\nI interviewed Director jointly with Government Worker on 9/21/23.\nShe said Youth J is transgender female and uses she/her\npronouns. Director said there are no reports of Youth J being\nraped at Lincoln Center, but she believes something may have\n9",
    "happened to the youth prior to admission. Director said Youth J\ncould not have been raped at Lincoln Center because since she\narrived, she has been on one-to-one staff supervision, isolates in\nher room, refuses to come out for meals or education, and refuses\nto socialize with peers. Director further indicated that Youth J\nwould not come to the visiting room to be interviewed today. In\nher experience, when adults question her, Youth J remains silent\nand extends her middle finger.\nGovernment Worker went to Youth J’s room to interview the\nyouth. Youth J remained silent and refused to talk.\nAllegation b):\nI interviewed Youth B jointly with Government Worker. He said he\ntried to calm down a peer who was upset and the peer punched\nhim in the nose. “Then I hit him three times in the face. Staff 3, 8\nand 9 got between and tried to separate us…I didn’t see the nurse\nthat day because my nose didn’t hurt then. The next day I saw\nthe nurse and went to the hospital…I feel the staff tried to stop it. I\ncommend them.”\nStaff 8 said two youths were escalated. Staff 3 verbally\nintervened but was unsuccessful in preventing a physical\naltercation. Two youths started fighting and somehow Youth B got\ninvolved. “I stood in the middle and tried to break it up. I got hit in\nthe face and called security.”\nI interviewed Staff 3 via phone on 10/24/23. He has worked at the\nfacility for ten months and has previous work experience at\nanother child caring institution. Staff 3 recalled the fight started\nwhen Youth B verbally intervened with Youth Q while Youth Q\nwas on top of the shower refusing to go to his room. “I asked\nYouth Q to come down. Staff 9 tried to calm Youth B. Youth Q\nand B kept bickering. Youth Q jumped off the shower and hit\nYouth B in the face. Youth B got hits in, and his nose bled. Me\nand Staff 8 stepped in between and separated Youths B and Q.\nThen other staff arrived to assist.”\nI interviewed Staff 9 via phone on 10/24/23. She has worked at\nthe facility for three months. Staff 9 recalled being in the control\nroom and hearing commotion. “I sprang into action immediately.\nYouths B and Q were brawling on the floor. I scooped Youth B up\nlifting him away from Youth Q and got in between him and Youth\nQ. Youth B’s nose was bleeding. I gave him a paper towel and\nused verbal interventions to calm him down.”\n10",
    "I interviewed Youth Q at the facility on 10/27/23 regarding the fight\non 9/06/23. He said he jumped down from on top of the shower\nand fought with Youth B. “Staff 3 broke it up. Staff 8 got him.\nWe’re all good now.” Youth Q denied that staff fail to intervene\nwhen youths fight.\nOn 10/27/23 I viewed video of the fight in the dayroom on Pod G.\nIt showed Youth Q aggressively approaching and hitting Youth B.\nStaff 3 and 8 struggled to physically separate the youths. Then\nYouth A rushes in behind Youth B and pulls him away from Youth\nQ.\nAllegation c):\nThis allegation that a youth is bullying other youths and taking\ntheir snacks is addressed in concurrent SIR 2023C0000787 by\nConsultant 2.\nGovernment Worker had no findings.\nAnalysis Allegation a): There is no evidence Youth T was raped at Lincoln\nCenter.\nAllegation b): There is no evidence staff failed to intervene in the\nfight between Youth B and Youth Q on 9/6/23.\nAllegation c): This allegation is addressed in concurrent SIR\n2023C0000787 by Consultant 2.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & Rule 400.4159 Youth restraint; pregnant youth; reduction,\nSection prevention; prohibited restraints; elimination of restraints.\nDescription (2) The following restraints are strictly prohibited:\n(g) Peer-on-peer discipline or utilizing the assistance of another\nyouth to implement a restraint.\nViolation Potential Rule of statute violation.\nType\nAllegation On 9/6/23 Youth B physically intervened to break up a fight\nbetween other youths. Peer on peer discipline is prohibited.\n11",
    "Investigation Youth B said he tried to calm down a peer who was upset and the\npeer punched him in the nose. “Then I hit him three times in the\nface. Staff 3, 8 and 9 got between and tried to separate us…I\ndidn’t see the nurse that day because my nose didn’t hurt then.\nThe next day I saw the nurse and went to the hospital…I feel the\nstaff tried to stop it. I commend them.”\nI asked Youth B if the staff at Lincoln Center allow or encourage\npeer on peer discipline. He stated, “No. I got consequences for\ntrying to calm my peer and got another consequence before that\nfor putting people in a hold. Supervisor tells us do not restrain\nother kids, but we don’t listen.”\nStaff 8 said two youths were escalated. Staff 3 verbally\nintervened but was not successful in preventing a physical\naltercation. Two youths started fighting and somehow Youth B got\ninvolved. She said staff do not allow or encourage youth to\ndiscipline or physically manage other youth.\nStaff 3 said the fight started when Youth B verbally intervened with\nYouth Q when he refused to go to his room and a fight ensued.\nStaff 3 denied Youth B tried to break up the fight, but rather he\nparticipated in it.\nStaff 9 recalled being in the control room and hearing a fight\ntaking place. “I sprang into action immediately. Youths B and Q\nwere brawling on the floor.” Staff 9 said Youth B was actively\nfighting and not trying to break it up.\nYouth Q denied that staff allow or encourage youth to physically\nintervene in fights or to restrain other youth.\nOn 10/27/23 I viewed video of the fight that happened in the Pod\nG dayroom on 9/18/23. It should be noted this video was available\nas it was saved due there being a fight. It showed Youth Q\naggressively approaching and hitting Youth B. Staff 3 and 8\nstruggle to physically separate the youths. Then apparently out of\nhis own volition, Youth A rushes in behind Youth B and pulls him\naway from Youth Q. There was no indication that Staff\nencouraged or allowed Youth A to physically intervene in the fight.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis Youth B said Supervisor directs youths not to physically intervene\nor restrain other youths, but the youths do not always follow\ndirections. Video shows Youth A pulled Youth B away from Youth\n12",
    "Q of his own volition. There is no evidence the facility supports\npeer on peer restraint or solicited assistance from Youth B or\nYouth A to physically intervene in the fight.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and a corrective action plan is required.\nOctober 31, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 31, 2023\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n13"
