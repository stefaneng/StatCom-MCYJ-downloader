No new\ninformation was provided.\nStaff 1 reported he did push Youth A three times on 10/15/24 as\nYouth A pushed him.

Youth A was in the common area and pushed another\nyouth who was at the table. Staff 1 redirected Youth A. Youth A\nthen walked from the common space into an adjoining room. Staff\n1 followed Youth A into the adjoining room. Staff 2 was already in\nthis room. Youth A then pushed Staff 1. After Youth A pushed\nStaff 1, Staff 1 proceeded to push Youth A three times with open\nhands towards Youth A. Staff 1 pushed Youth A in the head area.\nStaff 1 also grabbed the back of Youth A’s neck and pushed him\nup against the wall. Youth A was released from this and Staff 1 left\nthe unit.\n2",
