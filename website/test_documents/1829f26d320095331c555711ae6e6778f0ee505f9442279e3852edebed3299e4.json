    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription • (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and\nsuitable and able to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 8/29/25, during a parenting visit, the foster care supervisor\nbecame upset and cut the visit short. The foster care supervisor\ncalled the respondent parent derogatory names during the\nincident. The foster care supervisor then grabbed the youth out of\nthe parent's arms and threw the youth on the ground from a height\nof 5'7.\" The youth landed on their head on a concrete floor.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nParent A was interviewed by phone on 9/5/2025. He began the\nconversation by stating he wanted his case transferred to a\ndifferent agency, but that isn’t happening. He stated his parenting\ntime has been cancelled per court orders because he has made\nhis children anxious about their clothing, which he feels is\nridiculous. He stated, on 8/29/2025, he was on a Facetime call\nwith Parent B during her parenting time during which he heard\nFoster Care Supervisor call Parent B “weird bitch.” He stated he\nheard the phone fall and “a lot of commotion” before the phone\nhung up. He stated Parent B told him she had to push Foster Care\nSupervisor off of her and Foster Care Supervisor tried to snatch\nYouth A from Parent B causing Youth A to fall on the ground.\nParent A was asked specifically about the allegation Youth A was\ndropped on the ground by Foster Care Supervisor causing him to\nhit his head on a concrete floor. Parent A responded by stating\nthat was his understanding of what happened. He stated the\nagency is trying to cover it up by stating it’s not on video.\nParent B was interviewed by phone on 9/5/2025. She began the\ninterview by stating she wanted her case moved to a different\nagency, closer to her home. She stated she has been asking for\nthis for a long time, but the case has not yet been moved. When\nasked about the allegations, Parent B reported she had parenting\ntime scheduled with her children last Friday, 8/29/2025, at the\nagency office. She reported arriving 15 or 16 minutes late. She\nwalked in, gave her kids hugs and waters then sat down on the\ncouch. She stated one of her sons became sad and asked Parent\nB if she could call his dad, Parent A. Parent B reported she had a\nvisit the previous Tuesday during which the person who was\n2",
    "supervising that visit, Supportive Visitation Worker, allowed her to\ncall Parent A. Parent B stated she was using her phone to record\nher son running and Foster Care Supervisor got mad and told\nParent B she could not be on her phone during visits. Parent B\nasked Foster Care Supervisor if there was a court order stating\nshe could not be on her phone. Parent B stated she then called\nParent A via facetime at which time Foster Care Supervisor ended\nthe visit. Parent B stated Foster Care Supervisor told her to “stop\nbeing weird” then stated “you’re really weird. You’re a weird bitch.\nYou only act like this around your kids.” Parent B stated she was\nholding Youth A on her stomach near the doorway inside of the\nvisit room and Foster Care Supervisor “snatched” Youth A from\nParent B and “sat him down super hard.” Parent B stated Foster\nCare Supervisor did not drop Youth A as was alleged, but he\nstarted to cry when she sat him down. Parent B stated she walked\nout of the visit room and left the building after this happened.\nParent B was asked if Youth A had been dropped on his head on\na concrete floor from over 5 feet, to which she stated the person\nshe was talking to when she reported the allegation kept asking\nher for a height Youth A was dropped from, but she wasn’t sure.\nShe added she tried to call back the next day and “withdraw” the\nallegation stating it should not be investigated. When asked why,\nshe stated Program Manager told her the incident was not on\nvideo, so there was no proof it happened. When asked to again\ndescribe what happened, Parent B stated she stepped out of the\nvisit room, into the hallway, to see if security was coming. She\nstated the kids were standing near Foster Care Supervisor at the\ntime. Parent B stepped back into the room, and as she was\nhugging/holding Youth A near her stomach, Foster Care\nSupervisor grabbed him, forcefully setting him down on his feet.\nShe stated Youth A is not a steady walker yet, so when Parent B\nsets him down on his feet, she does it gently by sliding him down\nher body. When Foster Care Supervisor did it, she set him down\nroughly, so he lost his balance and fell back hitting his head.\nParent B stated she knows where all of the cameras are in that\nroom and there were no cameras pointing at them when this\nhappened. She stated there should be a moment prior to her\nleaving when she and her kids cannot be seen on camera. She\nstated she immediately left after the incident.\nParent B stated Foster Care Supervisor was calling her names\nthroughout the visit. She also stated Foster Care Supervisor gave\nParent B Uber gift cards but snatched them back out of her hand,\ntelling Parent B to sign a form.\n3",
    "Parent B reported Program Manager is saying Parent B\nthreatened to hit or hurt Foster Care Supervisor, but she didn’t.\nShe stated she told Program Manager she feels like Foster Care\nSupervisor wants someone to put their hands on her. Parent B\nstated she told Program Manager it would be wrong of her to put\nher hands on Foster Care Supervisor like Foster Care Supervisor\nput her hands on Youth A. She stated she apologized to Program\nManager for the situation during their conversation. Parent B\nended the interview by stating “I genuinely just want to be moved\naway from her” referring to Foster Care Supervisor.\nAfter the phone interview, Parent B sent text messages including\ntwo videos taken at the end of the visit during which Parent B is\nrepeatedly asking Foster Care Supervisor to say why the visit is\nbeing ended. Parent B also sent a photo of Youth A sitting on\ncouch with a circle drawn around the upper right front of his\nforehead. Multiple text messages were exchanged to seek\nclarification as Parent A wrote that the photo was of Youth A’s\ninjury; however, the photo was taken while Youth A was on the\ncouch in the visit room and Parent B had not previously reported\nthat Youth A sustained an injury. Parent B responded the photo\nwas a screenshot taken from a video she had taken of Youth A’s\ninjury at the beginning of the visit. After the text exchange a call\nwas made to Parent B as the messages were increasingly\nconfusing. When asked how she took a video of Youth A’s injury\nat the beginning of the visit when the alleged incident occurred at\nthe end of the visit which Parent B previously reported she\nimmediately left after, Parent B replied, “my bad the picture shows\nwhere the injury would have been.” Parent B was reminded of the\nallegation that Youth A fell back after being set down, to which she\nstated he “kind of fell sideways so the injury was near the\nfront/side.”\nYouth B was interviewed by phone on 9/5/2025. A few minutes\nafter Parent B’s phone interview concluded, she called back\nstating she was with Youth B for parenting time and wanted him\ninterviewed as he heard and saw everything that has occurred\nwith Foster Care Supervisor on 8/28/2025. Despite attempts to\nsuggest she focused on parenting time; she insisted and put him\non the phone. Youth B reported he recalls the visit with Parent B\nbeing ended early by Foster Care Supervisor the previous Friday.\nHe stated he never heard Foster Care Supervisor swear at Parent\nB or call Parent B by any name. He stated he never saw Foster\nCare Supervisor touch or grab Youth A. He denied seeing Youth A\nbeing dropped or falling over or hitting his head during that visit.\nThe call ended at that time; however, Parent B called again after\n4",
    "her parenting time stating her son wasn’t comfortable telling the\ntruth because the person supervising the visit was looking at him\nwhile he was talking.\nProgram Manager was interviewed via video conferencing on\n9/5/2025. She reported on 8/22/2025 she met with Parent A and\nParent B in person to explain that the court ordered Parent A’s\nvisits to be suspended. On 8/26/2025 Parent B had scheduled\nparenting time which was supervised by Supportive Visitation\nWorker. Program Manager was told that, during the visit, Parent B\ntold the Supportive Visitation Worker that Program Manager had\ngiven her permission to Facetime Parent A during the visit.\nProgram Manager stated she spoke with Foster Care Supervisor\non 8/27/2025 about this having occurred so Foster Care\nSupervisor knew it was not allowed. On 8/29/2025, Foster Care\nSupervisor was supervising Parent B’s visit during which she\nbegan to Facetime with Parent A. Foster Care Supervisor ended\nthe visit as this was not allowed. Program Manager stated she\nwas in the building during the visit but was not in the visit room\narea until after Parent B had left. When she arrived Foster Care\nSupervisor had Parent B’s 5 children with her in the agency office.\nProgram Manager stated she watched the kids while Foster Care\nSupervisor and another staff member put car seats in the car for\nthe youths to be transported back to their foster homes. During\nthis time, Program Manager was holding Youth A, and he was\nobserved to be in good spirits. Program Manager did not see any\ninjuries on Youth A. Program Manager stated Parent A was irate\nthat Parent B’s visit ended early and texted Program Manager at\n4:53pm stating that Foster Care Supervisor put her hands on\nYouth A and he wasn’t leaving until the police arrived. Program\nManager stated the police never arrived or spoke to anyone at the\noffice.\nProgram Manager stated she watched the video footage from the\n8/29/2025 visit on 9/2/225. At that time, she only watched the\nending of the visit where Foster Care Supervisor was alleged to\nhave put her hands on Youth A. Program Manager stated Foster\nCare Supervisor was not seen touching Youth A at any point prior\nto or immediately following Parent B leaving the visit. On 9/3/2025,\nProgram Manager watched the video footage of the entire\n8/29/2025 visit as she had spoken to Parent B who said Foster\nCare Supervisor snatched something out of her hands during the\nvisit. Program Manager stated the video shows Foster Care\nWorker approaching Parent B at 4:42pm with gifts cards in one\nhand and a form in the other. Parent B is seen trying to take the\ngift cards, but Foster Care Supervisor pulled her hand back.\n5",
    "Parent A then signed the form after which Foster Care Supervisor\nhanded her the gift cards. A minute later, Foster Care Supervisor\nwent to the visit room door, holding it open. She stated Parent B is\nseen walking through the door, presumably leaving the building.\nFoster Care Supervisor walked back into the visit room then left\nwith the youths through a different door in the room which exits\ninto the agency offices. Program Manager stated Foster Crae\nSupervisor is never seen picking up, holding, setting down, or\ndropping any of the youths.\nOn 9/2/2025 Parent B called Program Manager, but Program\nManager’s schedule did not allow her to return the call that day.\nOn 9/3/2025 Program Manager called Parent B after watching the\nvideo. Parent B told her at that time she had been calling people\nall day trying to get her case moved to a different agency, stating\nshe never liked Foster Care Supervisor. Program Manager stated\nshe could hear Parent A in the background throughout the call.\nThis is when Parent B first told Program Manager that Foster Care\nSupervisor “snatched” Youth A out of Parent B’s hands. Parent B\nstated the police were called after that happened. Program\nManager told Parent B she wasn’t aware of the police being called\nas they had not contacted anyone at the office. Program Manager\ntold Parent B she had watched the video footage from the visit\nroom and did not see what Parent B alleged. Parent B then made\nseveral statements about hurting Foster Care Supervisor the next\ntime she saw her. Program Manager heard Parent A also making\nthreats in the background at which point Program Manager stated\nshe was not going to continue the call and Parent B hung up.\nProgram Manager stated she filed a police report and a\ndepartment incident report regarding the threats the parents made\ntoward Foster Care Supervisor during the call.\nProgram Manager stated Parent A and Parent B called her\nmultiple times after that call, but she did not call them back until\nshe was able to have someone else present to witness the\ndiscussion. She reported calling Parent B on 9/4/2025 at 12:19pm\nwhile Program Manager 2 was present and taking notes. She\nstated Parent A was somber at the time and seemed remorseful.\nShe stated she could hear Parent A in the background and Parent\nB asked Program Manager if she was available to talk at 2:00pm.\nWhen Program Manager stated she was not, Parent B stated she\ndid not want to talk at the time. Program Manager said it seemed\nlike Parent B moved away from Parent A as he could no longer be\nheard in the background at which time Parent B stated she would\nnever hurt Foster Care Supervisor or anyone else. Parent B stated\nshe never had a problem with Foster Care Supervisor. Parent B\n6",
    "said she was afraid the case was going backward, and she was\nafraid Foster Care Supervisor was going to “report this stuff at\ncourt.” She stated she didn’t know why her visit ended early on\n8/29/2025. Program Manager explained to her the visit was ended\nbecause she called Parent A on Facetime when it had previously\nbeen explained to her his visits were suspended by the court and\nshe was not allowed to Facetime him during her visits. Program\nManager reiterated to Parent B that Parent A was to have no\ncontact with the youths. Parent B then stated something about\n“stuff” being snatched from her hand by Foster Care Supervisor\nduring the visit. Program Manager told Parent B what she saw on\nvideo regarding the gift cards. Parent B stated she doesn’t\nunderstand why people keep saying she is lying about things.\nProgram Manager gave Parent B the example of telling people\nFoster Care Supervisor had snatched and hurt Youth A, but that\nnothing like that is on video. Parent B then apologized and stated\n“it’s fine, whatever. She didn’t do it, but she was loud and rude.”\nParent B then asked Program Manager if she could speak to\nFoster Care Supervisor to apologize. Program Manager told\nParent B she could not speak with Foster Care Supervisor due to\nthe threats she made against her earlier in the week. At that time,\nProgram Manager again heard Parent A yelling in the background.\nParent B yelled to Parent A “you keep saying that shit that gets\nme in trouble.” Parent A was heard yelling that he was coming to\nthe agency to “fuck shit up” at which time Parent B ended the call.\nAfter the call was ended, Program Manager filed a new police\nreport about Parent A’s threats.\nProgram Manager stated she has worked with Foster Care\nSupervisor for many years and could not see her swearing at a\nparent or calling a parent names even when frustrated.\nFoster Care Supervisor was interviewed by video conferencing\non 8/18/2025. She reported there have been issues with Parent B\nFacetiming Parent A during her supervised parenting time over\nthe past couple of weeks. She stated Parent B had Facetimed\nParent A during her parenting time on 8/19/2025 but the worker\nwho was supervising did not know. It wasn’t until the youths told\ntheir foster parents that Parent A was on Facetime during the visit\nthat Foster Care Supervisor found out. The following day,\n8/20/2025, Program Manager called Parent B and told her Parent\nA was not allowed any contact with the youths, including\nFacetime. On 8/26/2025 Supportive Visitation Worker was\nsupervising Parent B’s parenting time during which Parent B\nbegan Facetiming Parent A. Supportive Visitation Worker told her\nshe was not allowed to Facetime Parent A, but Parent B told her\n7",
    "Program Manager gave her permission to do it, so she continued\nthe Facetime call. On 8/29/2025 Foster Care Supervisor was\nsupervising Parent B’s parenting time. Foster Care Supervisor\nstated she thought she saw Parent B Facetiming and asked\nParent B what she was doing to which she replied she was taking\nvideo of Youth A walking. Foster Care Supervisor stated she\nbelieved her as Youth A has recently started to walk, but then\nFoster Care Supervisor heard Parent A’s voice coming through\nthe phone. Foster Care Supervisor told Parent B she knows she is\nnot supposed to be Facetiming Parent A to which Parent B\nresponded Program Manager told her it was ok to do so. Foster\nCare Supervisor told Parent B she knew that wasn’t true at which\ntime Parent B became upset and confrontational. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated a building staff member came in and told her\nParent A was there wanting to talk to Foster Care Supervisor, but\nFoster Care Supervisor said he did not have an appointment to\nmeet with her, and she was busy supervising a visit. Foster Care\nSupervisor then heard Parent A yelling at her through Parent B’s\nphone. Foster Care Supervisor told Parent A his interaction with\nher was inappropriate and that he had to leave the building.\nParent B became verbally hostile so Foster Care Supervisor told\nher the visit would end. Parent B began recording Foster Care\nSupervisor with her phone and kept asking Foster Care\nSupervisor to say why the visit was being ended. Foster Care\nSupervisor called security a couple of times, but they never came.\nShe was at the visitation room door, holding it open and the\nyouths were all on the couch at the opposite end of the room.\nParent B approached Foster Care Supervisor, still recording her\nbefore leaving. Foster Care Supervisor left with the children\nthrough a different door which is only accessible to staff. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated as she was getting the youths ready to\nleave, she received a text message from either Parent A or Parent\nB stating the police were called because Foster Care Supervisor\nput her hands on Youth A.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated Parent B did not hug or hold any of\nthe youths before she walked through the door to leave. Foster\nCare Supervisor stated she did not pick up, grab, hold, or drop\nYouth A at any point during the visit. She stated the only time she\ntouched him was when she was putting him in the car seat to\nleave.\nFoster Care Supervisor stated she heard Parent B accused her of\ntaking gift cards out of her hand. Foster Care Supervisor stated\nParent B is given $200 in Uber gift cards every Friday for\ntransportation to the next week’s visits. Each week, Parent B signs\n8",
    "a form when she is given the gift cards. Parent B was upset at the\ntime and was saying she was not coming to anymore visits if\nFoster Care Supervisor would be there, so Foster Care Supervisor\nasked Parent B if she wanted the cards. Parent B tried to grab the\ncards out of Foster Care Supervisor’s hand, so Foster Care\nSupervisor pulled her hand back and said, “come on, just sign the\nslip” to which Parent B responded, “you’re weird.” Foster Care\nSupervisor stated she said, “you’re being weird,” in response,\nwhich she regrets saying. Parent B then signed the paper and\nFoster Care Supervisor gave her the gift cards. Foster Care\nSupervisor denied swearing at Parent B at any point during their\ninteraction. She stated she does not know how long Parent A was\non Facetime or what he could hear. She added it was her\ntestimony that resulted in Parent A’s visits being suspended so he\nheld her personally responsible.\nVIDEO FOOTAGE REVIEWED\nOn 9/9/2025 video footage was reviewed via video conferencing\nwith Program Manager.

The\nyouths were not near either Parent B or Foster Care\nSupervisor.\n• Foster Care Supervisor re-entered the visit room without\nParent B, walked to a door at the bottom right of the screen\nand walked out with the youths following her. Youth A is the\nlast youth seen walking out of the room, on his own, at\n4:45pm\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\nCourt Order dated 7/9/2025 stating the following:\n• Parenting time with Parent A, even if supervised, may be\nharmful to the children.\n• Parenting time of Parent A is suspended.\n• The therapist report indicates visits with Parent A are doing\nharm to the children’s mental health and should be\nsuspended.\n• Based on testimony of the worker about the trauma to the\nchildren prior to visits and the therapist report Parent A’s\nvisits are hereby suspended.\nFoster Care Supportive Visitation Weekly Progress report written\nby Supportive Visitation Worker on 8/29/2025 stating:\n10",

    "• From Parent B – In the beginning of me recording them first\ntwo videos in the blind spot of the door.\nEmail from Program Manager 2 to Program Manager documenting\nthe 9/4/2025 phone conversation with Parent B. The notes were\nconsistent with what Program Manager reported was said during\nthe conversation, including the following:\n• Program Manager informed Parent B that she watched the\nvideo two times and Foster Care Supervisor never had\nYouth A in her arms. At this time Parent B stated,\n\"whatever it does not matter\". Program Manager reported it\ndoes matter because these are serious allegations. Parent\nB then stated, \"that is fine, she did not do it, but she was\nverbally loud and rude.\" Parent B stated again that this did\nnot occur.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance regarding Foster Care\nSupervisor demonstrating suitable character and ability to provide\nfor the needs of youths and families as the video footage refutes\nParent A’s allegations as Foster Care Supervisor is never seen\ntouching, grabbing, picking up, setting down, or dropping Youth A\nat any point during Parent B’s visit. Contrary to Parent B’s\nallegations, there is no area near the visit room door that is not in\nview of the camera. Additionally, while Foster Care Supervisor did\npull her hand back when Parent B attempted to take gift cards\nfrom her hand she did not grab anything out of Parent B’s hand.\nFinally, while Foster Care Supervisor stated she did say “you’re\nbeing weird” to Parent B there is no evidence to support Parent\nB’s allegations that Foster Care Supervisor swore at her or called\nher names.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n12",
