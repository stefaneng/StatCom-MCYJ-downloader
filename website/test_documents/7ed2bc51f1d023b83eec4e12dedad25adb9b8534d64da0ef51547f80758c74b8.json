    "VI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere have been five special investigations during this period under review. The\ninvestigations involved allegations of improper restraints and the grievance procedure\nnot being followed. Three of the five investigations did not result in any rule\nviolations. Two of the five investigations are still pending investigation. The facility’s\ncorrective action plan compliance is monitored quarterly, and they not have any active\ncorrective action plans.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nGerber House has not had any youth placed since December 1, 2021, due to staffing\nissues. The goal of the facility is to hire more staff and be able to place youth back\ninto Gerber House as staff are hired. The staff at Putnam House are seasoned staff\nthat have good leadership qualities that are able to mentor and coach the newer staff.\nThe management team has been providing a lot of education to staff regarding\nlicensing rules, policies and the “why” behind what Eagle Village does. The facility\nhas seen this as a positive tool for the staff. The Corrective Action Plan from the\nrenewal audit last year has been implemented and changes have been made as\nneeded.\nInterviews\nYouth reported in interviews feeling safe, understanding the rules of the house, and\nspoke of a camping trip they had just participated in. Two youth described liking\nwhere they lived and staff being strict but fair. One youth described being in an\nimproper restraint and staff making threats against him. These allegations were\ninvestigated with no findings. Staff reported a lot of newer staff working at the facility\nbut feeling they are getting direction from the supervisor and upper management.\nStaff did not have any concerns with their work environment.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on their regular license.\nMay 31, 2022\n________________________________________\nBarbara Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\n2",
