INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nDescription service policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youths have been knowingly going without medication they are\nprescribed. On multiple occasions, youths have been taken to the\nhospital due to going without mental health medication they are\nprescribed. There have been 61 calls to LE from this facility since\n8/10/23 and there are concerns the need of the youths are not\nbeing met.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n01/10/2024.\nOn 01/26/2024 additional allegations received noted: Youth C had\nmedication prescribed that needed to be filled and the agency\nrefused to pick up the medication, claiming the insurance refused\nto pay for the medication.\nInterviews:\nI interviewed the Complainant via telephone, on 01/10/2024, and\nconfirmed the information in the allegations.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator (CA) at the agency, on\n01/11/2024. CA reported Youth A was placed at the agency on\n11/22/2023 and at the time of placement Youth A had two weeks\nsupply of medication. She said Youth A’s Foster Care Worker also\nprovided a refill for two weeks. CA said the process when Youths\nare placed at the agency is to schedule psychiatric appointments\nwith Saginaw County Community Mental Health (CMH), but it has\nbeen a challenge because the earliest appointment for Youth A\nwas not available until 01/16/2024. CA admitted that the agency\nhas had to call law enforcement excessively due to youths’\naggressive behaviors, self-harming, and to transport youths to the\nemergency department to obtain refills on medication due to not\nbeing able to get earlier appointments with (CMH). CA said the\n2",
    "agency policy is the Foster Care Worker is responsibility for\ngetting the youths medication refilled and Administrator 1 was in\ncontact with the Foster Care Worker to get Youth A medication\nrefilled. She further said most of the time Youth A refuses to take\nher medication.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the agency on 01/11/2024. Staff 1 has\nbeen working at the agency for 6 months and is trained in\nmedication dispensing. Staff 1 reported the agency policy is\nFoster Care Workers are responsible for providing medication at\ntime of placement and scheduling appointments for Youths to get\nrefills for their medications. She said Youth A and Youth B were\nboth hospitalized for self-harming and required refills on their\nmedication in December 2023. Staff 1 said staff are required to\ncontact law enforcement when youths are aggressive, self-\nharming, injured, or AWOLs. She has contacted law enforcement\ndue to the youths being assaultive with staff and self-harming.\nI interviewed Youth A at the agency on 01/11/2024. Youth A has\nbeen at the agency since 11/22/2023. Youth A is prescribed\nmedication for depression, she admitted not taking her medication\ndaily, because the agency ran out of her medication. She was\nhospitalized last month for self-harming.\nI interviewed Youth B on 01/11/2024. Youth B reported she was\nplaced at the Agency on 11/22/2023. Youth B is prescribed\nmedication for depression. Youth B admitted that she has gone\ntwo weeks without taking her medication. Youth B reported she\nhad to go to hospital to get medication refilled.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 1 on 01/24/2024 via telephone.\nFoster Care Worker 1 reported Youth A has been in placement for\ntwo months and was initially provided a two-week supply of\nmedication at the time of placement. Foster Care Worker 1\nreceived a requested on 12/01/2023 from the agency asking for\nrefill of Youth A’s medication (Hydroxyzine), so she reached out to\nYouth A’s previous doctor was able to get Youth two refills. Foster\nCare Worker 1 said it difficulty to get an intake appointment with\nCMH and the delay did cause an issue with getting Youth A’s\nmedication refilled. Foster Care Worker 1 confirmed Youth A had\nto go to the emergency room to get refills for her medication.\nYouth A’s intake appointment with CMH was yesterday and she\nhas an appointment with a psychiatrist in two weeks. The Foster\nCare Worker didn’t specifically say that she was expected to get\nthe refills, but when the agency reached out and said they were\n3",
    "running out of medication Foster Care did step up and try to\ncontact the previous provider to get the refills.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 2 (FCW 2) on 01/29/2024 via\ntelephone. Foster Care Worker 2 reported Youth B was placed at\nthe agency on 11/22/2024 and initially provided with a two-week\nsupply of her medication. FCW 2 said there was a delay in getting\nYouth B’s intake appointment scheduled with Saginaw County\nCMH, so Youth B was taken to the emergency department for\nself-harming and needed her medication refilled. FCW said the\nagency contacted him on 01/01/2024 in reference to getting Youth\nB’s medication refilled and he scheduled a telehealth appointment\nfor Youth B on 01/02/2024 with her previous health care provider.\nConsultant 1 interviewed Administrator 1 at the agency on\n01/30/2024 in reference to additional allegation received regarding\nYouth C’s medication not being filled. Administrator 1 explained\nthat this issue was related to insurance. Youth C was prescribed a\ncough suppressant (not an over-the-counter medication). The\ntechnician at the pharmacy explained there wasn’t a generic or\nreplacement for the medication prescribed. It was a Friday night\nand Administrator 1 sent an email to the team that the pharmacy\nhad the prescription, but insurance wouldn’t cover it. The team\nspoke to the health liaison, but it took a few days to resolve the\nissue. By that time, Youth C was discharged to her next\nplacement. In the meantime, they did a home remedy to help\nYouth C cough (hot tea, cough drops, and lemon). Administrator 1\nis the one who took Youth C to the emergency department. She\nreported Youth C did not have an upper respiratory infection, and\nthe medication was to assist in suppressing her cough. Even with\nthe home remedies, the cough subsided. Youth C was given tea\nand lemon as often as she wanted. Administrator 1 referenced the\nagency made efforts to let Foster Care Worker know that the\ninsurance did not cover the medication, indirectly indicating it was\nnot the agency’s responsibility to cover the cost of the medication.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 3 via telephone on 02/14/2024.\nFoster Care Worker 3 reported Youth 3 was placed at the agency\non 01/06/2024. Youth 3 was taken to the emergency department\non 01/19/2024 and was prescribed cough suppressant. Foster\nCare Worker 3 received an email from Administrator 1 on\n01/22/24 stating Youth C was taken to the emergency department\non 01/19/2024, was prescribed cough suppressant, and Youth C’s\ninsurance did not cover the medication, so the medication was not\npicked up by the agency. Foster Care Worker 3 attempted to pay\nfor the medication over the telephone, but there was an issue with\n4",
    "the pharmacy’s payment system. Foster Care Worker 3 called the\nagency on 02/23/2024, spoke with staff, but could not recall who\nshe spoke with, and asked them to pick up the medication and\nFoster Care Worker 3 would reimburse the agency. The agency\ndid not pick up the medication, so the medication was not picked\nup until 01/24/2024 by Foster Care Worker 3.\nDocumentation reviewed for the investigation:\n• Health Services Policy and Procedures edited 06/27/2023:\nAll residents are to be provided with timely, routine medical\ndental and medical care.
