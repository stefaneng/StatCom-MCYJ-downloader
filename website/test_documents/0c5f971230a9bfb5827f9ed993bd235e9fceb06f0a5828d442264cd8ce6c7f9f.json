    "summary": "An investigation into the Calumet Center juvenile facility found that staff members transported a resident to his bedroom by holding his arms and dragging his feet along the floor after he dropped his weight, which violated the facility's approved behavior management system. The incident occurred after the resident was destroying property in another resident's room and became physically aggressive toward staff. The facility is clearly culpable for the violation, as the staff's technique was unapproved and not compliant with established policy, and the administration is required to submit a corrective action plan.",
