Supervisor 1 hit youth in the head multiple times.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received 01/31/22 and investigated jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The complaint noted the following,\nYouth A (18) resides at Spectrum Juvenile Justice Services where Supervisor 1\nis employed. On January 29, 2022, Youth A and Supervisor 1 got into an\nargument. Youth A and Supervisor 1 then began to assault each other.\nSupervisor 1 hit Youth A in the head multiple times. Youth A did not have any\nmarks or bruises and was treated by the facility's nurse. The incident was caught\non video camera.\nI interviewed the Director at the facility on 02/01/22, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nThe Director said that it appeared to her that Supervisor 1 hit Youth A during this\naltercation. The Director has removed Supervisor 1 from the schedule pending the\n3",
    "investigation. Youth A is currently in psychiatric care due to self-harming behaviors.\nThe video was provided by the Director for review. In summary, the video showed\nthe following: Video starts about 5:18:57 and Pod 7 can be seen with Supervisor 1,\nYouth A and Supervisor 2 in the open common area. Youth A appeared to be\narguing with Supervisor 1. Youth A continued to talk to Supervisor 2 and pointed at\nSupervisor 1. Supervisor 2 positioned himself between Youth A and Supervisor 1.\nAbout 5:27:28, Youth A maneuvered around Supervisor 2 and ran up on Supervisor\n1, who was near the door that exits the pod. Youth A and Supervisor 1 grabbed one\nanother, and Supervisor 1 was seen punching at Youth A. It was not clear whether\ncontact was made. Supervisor 2 separated Youth A from Supervisor 1 and escorted\nher to her room.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 at the facility on 02/01/22, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Supervisor 2 reported that he came on the pod after receiving a call for\nassistance from Supervisor 1. Upon arrival to the pod, Supervisor 2 said that Youth\nA was saying to Supervisor 1, “Say to me what you said to Youth B.” Supervisor 2\nsaid that Youth A and Supervisor 1 continued to argue, and Supervisor 2 directed\nSupervisor 1 to leave the pod. Supervisor 2 said that he asked Supervisor 1 to leave\nthe pod “over 10 times” during this incident. Supervisor 2 said that he told Supervisor\n1 to open the door and she did not. Supervisor 2 said that Youth A got around him\nand went after Supervisor 1. Supervisor 2 said that he separated the two and got\nYouth A into a hold and then escorted her into her room after Supervisor 1 opened\nYouth A’s bedroom door. Supervisor 2 said Youth B was in her room on the pod but\nnot involved. Supervisor 2 said that, at the time, he did not see Supervisor 1 hit\nYouth A, but stated that it did look like she hit Youth A when he reviewed the video.\nSupervisor 2 said that Supervisor 1 did have a hold on Youth A’s hair during the\naltercation. Supervisor 2 said that Youth A and Supervisor 1 have had previous\naltercations and Youth A assaulted Supervisor 1 about two or three weeks ago.\nYouth A was not injured but did see the Nurse the next day. Supervisor 2 said that\nYouth A is still out of the facility in psychiatric hospitalization due to self-harming\nbehavior.\nI interviewed Youth B at the facility on 02/01/22, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth B reported that she was in her room during the altercation between\nSupervisor 1 and Youth A. Youth B said that she and Youth A were arguing, but\nYouth A’s anger became focused on Supervisor 1. Youth B said that she told\nSupervisor 1 not to be afraid of Youth A. Youth A reportedly said she wanted to fight\nSupervisor 1 earlier in the day. Supervisor 1 reportedly said that she didn’t come to\nwork to fight with kids and Youth B said Supervisor 1 was initially backing up from\nYouth A. Youth B said Supervisor 1 called for assistance on the radio and\nSupervisor 2 came to the pod. Youth B said Supervisor 2 told Supervisor 1 to leave,\nto take a break, and to go calm down, but Supervisor 1 stayed. Youth B said she did\nnot know why Supervisor 1 stayed on the pod. Youth B said that although she was in\nher room, she did see Youth A run up on Supervisor 1. Due to the angle from Youth\nB’s bedroom and where the altercation occurred, Youth B could not see the actual\nphysical incident. Supervisor 2 broke up the altercation. After the incident, Youth B\n4",
    "said that Supervisor 1 told Youth A that she would have “decked her in her shit if\nSupervisor 2 wasn’t there.” Youth B said that after Youth A was secured in her room,\nSupervisor 1 continued to staff their pod and continued to argue with Youth A.\nSupervisor 2 left the pod once Youth A was secured.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility, on 02/01/22, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Supervisor 1 reported that Youth A and Youth B were arguing, and she\nwas redirecting them. Youth A then began to focus on Supervisor 1 and said she\nwas going to take Supervisor 1’s keys. Youth A approached Supervisor 1 and\nSupervisor 1 said that she stood up and stepped back. Supervisor 1 said Youth A\nwas threatening so Supervisor 1 called for assistance. Supervisor 2 arrived on the\npod quickly and was talking to Youth A. Supervisor 1 said that she and Supervisor 2\nwere trying to deescalate Youth A, and that Youth A calmed down a bit but then\nescalated again. Supervisor 1 said she made her way toward the door but stayed on\nthe pod to ensure Supervisor 2 was ok with the females on the unit. Youth A went by\nthe staff table with the completed observation sheets, so Supervisor 2 went to\nintervene. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A then went around Supervisor 2 and\ncharged toward her. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A threw a few punches and she\nblocked them. Supervisor 1 said that her hands got stuck in Youth A’s hair.\nSupervisor 2 restrained Youth A and walked her into her bedroom. Supervisor 1 said\nthat Supervisor 2 told her to leave the pod when Youth A tried to assault her.\nSupervisor 1 said she didn’t think Youth A was going to be assaultive. Supervisor 1\ndenied hitting Youth A or verbally antagonizing Youth A. Supervisor 1 said that she\ndidn’t say much to Youth A because she didn’t want to escalate her. Supervisor 1\nsaid Youth B was talking to them through her bedroom door. Supervisor 1 denied\nsaying Youth A was lucky that Supervisor 1 was there. When asked why she didn’t\nleave the pod for about 9 ½ minutes of this incident, Supervisor 1 said that she didn’t\nleave because Supervisor 2 is a male, and she didn’t want to leave him alone with\nthe two female youth. Supervisor 1 also said she didn’t leave because Youth A was\ncalming and then escalating and cycled between the two. Finally, Supervisor 1 said\nshe didn’t leave because she didn’t have enough room to get around Youth A to the\ndoor. After Youth A was secured in her room, Supervisor 1 said that she left the pod\nbriefly and then returned to continue monitoring the two youth. When asked why she\nreturned to monitor the youth after this altercation, Supervisor 1 said they didn’t have\nother staff. I then challenged that another staff or supervisor should have swapped\nwith her, and she agreed. Supervisor 1 denied any further problems that evening\nbetween she and Youth A but did report that Youth A demonstrated self-harm and\nwas subsequently taken to the hospital. Supervisor 1 stated that she is a trigger for\nYouth A who challenges Supervisor 1 as a peer. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A has\ntimes when her frustrations come out at Supervisor 1. I reiterated that these issues\nwould have made it all the better for Supervisor 1 to leave the area during this\nincident.\nIt is notable that Youth A was not able to be interviewed during this investigation as\nshe was hospitalized. The hospital subsequently released Youth A on her own,\n5",
    "without contacting the facility or Youth A’s assigned worker. Her whereabouts were\nunknown.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Handle with Care training documentation for Supervisor 1. Verbal and\nphysical components completed within the year.\n Policy review for behavior management completed by Supervisor 1, 12/09/21.\n Suspension pending investigation notice for Supervisor 1, 01/31/22.\n Written statement from Youth A, dated 01/31/22. The statement noted that\nSupervisor 1 was on the pod and told Youth A she was ‘going to beat my ass\nand that she already has the last time I ran up on her.’ The statement said\nnothing would have happened if Supervisor 1 would have left the pod like\nasked by Supervisor 2 ‘multiple times.’ Youth A wrote that she ran up on\nSupervisor 1 and swung twice. The statement noted that Supervisor 1 ‘hit me\non the top of my head and Supervisor 2 got in between us. Escorted me to\nmy room.’\n Written statement from Youth B, dated 01/31/22. The statement was\nconsistent with Youth B’s interview.\n Written statement from Supervisor 1, dated 01/31/22. The statement was\nconsistent with Supervisor 1’s interview.\n Supervisor 1 had one disciplinary action in her employee file, and it was\nrelated to not properly logging medications on 12/31/21. She was suspended\nfor three days, 01/20/22-01/22/22.\n Unusual Incident Report, 01/29/22, for Youth A, authored by Supervisor 2.\nThe report was consistent with Supervisor 2’s interview and the video review.\nThe report noted that, ‘Youth A charged towards Supervisor 1 who failed to\nmake use of the physical restraint technique and they began exchanging\npunches.’\n6",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Discipline.\n(2) An institution shall prohibit all cruel and severe\ndiscipline, including any of the following:\n(a) Any type of corporal punishment inflicted in any\nmanner.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule, as Supervisor 1 punched\nYouth A during this altercation. While it is not clear if the punch\nfrom Supervisor 1 connected with Youth A, Youth A’s written\nstatement indicated it did.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0108014 - intake 02/17/22; CAP pending\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nSupervisor 1 did not demonstrate the ability to fulfill the duties of her job.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was observed that Supervisor 1 punched\nYouth A instead of using her physical management training. Supervisor 1 remained\non the pod while Youth A escalated and did not leave when directed to do so by\nSupervisor 2 numerous times.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nANALYSIS: Supervisor 1 did not demonstrate the ability to perform her job\nduties, as evidenced by her punching Youth A and by refusing\nto leave the pod when directed to do so by Supervisor 2.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n7",
    "ALLEGATION:\nOn January 15, 2022, Supervisor 3 picked Youth A up and threw her in her room. As\na result, Youth A hit her head on the doorway. In addition, Youth A has a bruise on\nher arm and red abrasion her back from Supervisor 3 grabbing ahold of her.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 01/31/22 from DCWL Intake. The complaint was\ntransferred for investigation by DCWL. The following was reported,\nYouth A (18) resides at Spectrum Juvenile Justice Services where Supervisor 3\nis employed as a supervisor. On January 15, 2022, Supervisor 3 picked Youth A\nup and threw her in her room. As a result, Youth A hit her head on the doorway.\nIn addition, Youth A has a bruise on her arm and red abrasion her back from\nSupervisor 3 grabbing ahold of her shirt or bra, but there is no open skin. Youth A\nhas an article of clothing, which is possibly her bra with blood on it following the\nincident.\nDCWL Intake reported that DHHS and DCWL never received notice of this intake,\nbut it was found when Intake was searching through history for the victim on the\nprevious complaint. The complaint was then assigned for investigation.\nI interviewed the Nurse at the facility on 02/01/22. The Nurse said that Youth A\nreported that Supervisor 3 put his hands on her and threw her into a door. The\nNurse said that this incident reportedly occurred the weekend prior to the complaint\nbeing filed. The allegations were reviewed with the Nurse who said that Youth A had\na bruise on her armpit area, but Youth A did not know where it came from. The\nNurse filed the report after meeting with Youth A and hearing the allegations.\nI interviewed Supervisor 3 at the facility on 02/01/22. Supervisor 3 said that he was\ncalled to the pod and when he arrived, Staff 1 and Youth A were arguing, and Youth\nA was being aggressive toward Staff 1. Supervisor 3 stepped between them, and\nSupervisor 4 arrived. At this time, Youth A assaulted Supervisor 4 so she was put in\na two-man escort and taken to her room. Supervisor 3 said that Youth A did not hit\nthe door, wall, or door frame as she entered the room. Supervisor 3 said this was a\n“good two-person escort” and was not excessive. Supervisor 3 denied picking Youth\nA up off her feet.\nI interviewed Supervisor 4 at the facility on 02/01/22. Supervisor 4 reported that he\nresponded to a call for assistance and when he arrived to the pod, Youth A was\nthreatening Staff 1. Supervisor 4 said Youth A was calling Staff 1 “Jennifer” who is a\nname from Youth A’s past, but not Staff 1’s name. Supervisor 4 said he stepped\nbetween Youth A and Staff 1. Youth A became assaultive requiring Supervisor 3 and\nSupervisor 4 to put Youth A in a two-person escort and then they took her to her\nroom and let her go. Supervisor 4 said that he did not see Youth A hit her head on\nanything during the transport. Supervisor 4 said that when Supervisor 3 debriefed\n8",
    "with Youth A, Youth A said she was bleeding but there was no blood anywhere.\nSupervisor 4 said that Youth A saw the Nurse the following day because the incident\noccurred later at night. Supervisor 4 said he came in the following day and talked\nwith Youth A, who said she didn’t remember any of the incident.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 02/01/22. Staff 1 reported that during this\nincident Youth A thought Staff 1 was someone else from Youth A’s past and kept\ncalling her “Jennifer” although that is not Staff 1’s name. Youth A became\naggressive, and Staff 1 continued to back up and stay separated from Youth A.\nSupervisors 3 and 4 came to the pod and put Youth A in a two-person escort and\ntook her to her room at the point Youth A became assaultive. Staff 1 denied seeing\nYouth A lifted off the floor and denied seeing Youth A hit her head on anything. After\nthe incident Staff 1 said Youth A had a scratch on her chest, but noted it was self-\ninflicted. Staff 1 also noted that Youth A said her head hurt but didn’t say why or\nmake a report that something happened to her.\nI reviewed video of this incident with the Director on 02/01/22. The video shows\nSupervisors 3 and 4 put Youth A in a two-man escort hold and begin walking her to\nher room. Youth A pulls up her legs and Supervisors 3 and 4 proceed to carry her for\nabout 2-3 seconds. Once at the doorway to Youth A’s bedroom, it appears the\nsupervisors put her in the room on the floor. The view is obstructed, and it cannot be\nseen if Youth A hit her head.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Unusual Incident Report, for Youth A, dated 01/16/22, authored by Facility\nManager. The report notes that Supervisors 3 and 4 ‘immediately placed\nYouth A in the two-man escort technique for 10 seconds then placed her in\nher room for regular sleeping hours.’\n Progress Note for Youth A, dated 01/18/22, authored by the Nurse. Noted\nYouth A was examined and reported bruising on her arm and a scratch on her\nback from a restraint over the weekend involving Supervisor 3. The injuries\nwere documented, and the Nurse made a report to DHHS. A photo of\npetechiae bruising on one upper, inner arm, near the armpit was provided. A\nphoto of a vertical scratch on the lower/middle back, along the spine was\nprovided. The scratch was reported to be about 3.5 inches.\n9",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: The facility is noncompliant with the rule as evidenced by the\ntwo supervisors continuing to take Youth A to her room, after\nshe lifted her legs up off the floor. The supervisors then\nproceeded to carry Youth A by her arms. This is not a safe, nor\nappropriate manner in which to manage youth. Once the youth\nstopped willingly walking to her room and pulled her feet up, the\nescort became a restraint and the staff should have either\nlowered her to the floor and held her in place, or disengaged, as\ncarrying a youth is not permitted in the facility restraint model.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0108014 - intake 02/17/22; CAP pending\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe incident report did not accurately identify all aspects of the incident.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was observed that the Unusual Incident\nReport, authored by the Facility Manager and approved by the Director, did not\nidentify that Youth A was carried to her room by Supervisors 3 and 4. The carrying\nwas observed on video. Additionally, the report noted, ‘Youth A has been examined\nby the Facility Nurse.’ This is not true, as Youth A was put in her bedroom for\n‘regular sleeping hours’ as this incident occurred after 9:10pm. Youth A was not\nseen by the nurse until 01/18/22 per the Nursing note.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(3) The written policy shall include all of the following:\n10",
    "(a) Procedures for the review of an incident of restraint\nwithin 48 hours by a level of supervision above the staff\nordering or conducting the restraint to determine if the\nrequirements of the institution’s procedures were\nadhered to in directing and conducting the restraint.\n(c) Procedures for recording restraints as an incident\nreport.\nANALYSIS: The facility is noncompliant with the rule as evidenced by the\nincident report not reflecting that Youth A was carried into her\nroom by Supervisors 3 and 4. Additionally, the Unusual Incident\nReport Summary noted that Youth A was examined by the\nFacility Nurse, but this exam did not occur until 01/18/22.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2022C0207017 - intake 01/21/22; CAP pending\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nMarch 7, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 12, 2022\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n11"
