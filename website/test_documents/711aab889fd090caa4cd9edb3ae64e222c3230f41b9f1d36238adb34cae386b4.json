    "INVESTIGATION:\nThe allegation in full reads as follows:\nResident A was restrained due to throwing a student computer across the cabin.\nStaff 1 did not follow all policy as it relates to the behavior management. Resident A\ndid not make any allegations, have any injuries, nor state that he felt unsafe around\nStaff 1. After reviewing the cameras is when the report was made. Staff 1 did a floor\nrestraint, which he knew was not correct. Resident A was not injured and did not\nhave any complaints about the restraint. They have counseled Staff 1 and assigned\nhim to another unit. He has no prior history of improper restraints. He is completing\nNVCI training again this week.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 by phone on 3/1/2021. He reports that the incident\nwas reported after he reviewed the video recording of the restraint. He also reports\nthat Staff 1 did not follow the procedure for deescalating Resident A nor the\nprocedure for an appropriate restraint. He reported that Staff 1 and Staff 2 were both\n“written up” for the behaviors he observed on the video recording. He also reported\nthat Staff 1 has been moved to another dorm and will not be allowed to have any\ncontact with Resident A at this time. He reports other action that is being taken\ninvolves Staff 1 completing the NVCI (nonviolent crisis intervention) behavior\nmanagement training again and checking in with a supervisor when he begins his\nshift to ensure that he is emotionally regulated. He ended by reporting that Staff 1\nhas no prior disciplinary action in his Human Resource file.\nI interviewed Administrator 1 at the facility on 3/2/2021. He provided the name\nand phone number for Staff 2 and other documentation for the three residents that\nwere involved in the incident.\nI interviewed Resident A at the facility on 3/2/2021. He reported remembering the\nincident and being restrained by Staff 1. He also reports that he is “good with it” and\n“didn’t get hurt” when reporting the restraint. He reports being upset because he\nmissed his evening snack when he did not come out of his room when called to get\nhis snack. He also reports that he was mad and “threw a computer” just before Staff\n1 restrained him. He reported feeling safe at the facility although he believes that he\nis not getting much help with the programing at the facility. He also reported that he\njust wants to go home and live with his mother, but she is not talking to him at this\ntime. He did report that his worker is visiting him each month and knows of his lack\nof progress.\nI interviewed Resident B at the facility on 3/2/2021. He reported remembering the\nrestraint of Resident A and being part of the restraint. He also reported that Resident\nA was mad because he did not get his snack. He reports that Resident A will throw\nthings when upset and that is what happened just prior to Staff 1 restraining him. He\nalso reports hearing Staff 2 telling Staff 1 to stop the restraint. He reported that\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "Resident A punched Staff 1 while they were lying on the floor and Staff 1 struggled\nto hold Resident A in the restraint. He stated, “Staff 1 couldn’t hold him, so I grabbed\nhis arm and Resident C grabbed his leg to assist with the restraint. The whole thing\nonly last a few seconds and was the fastest restraint I have seen.” He reported a\nbelief that Resident A should have been restrained because he was throwing things.\nResident B reports feelings safe at the facility and that the program is helping him\nmake the changes he needs.\nI interviewed Resident C at the facility on 3/2/2021. He reports remembering the\nincident with Resident A and that he “helped with the restraint”. He stated, “Staff 1\nwas trying to restrain Resident A by himself, so I grabbed Resident A’s leg and put\nhim in his room when the restrain was over”. He reported being Resident A’s\nroommate and the person who helps him when he gets upset. He also reported that\nthe restraint was needed because Resident A was being unsafe when he began to\nthrow things around the room and “may have been trying to get at a peer he doesn’t\nlike”. He reports that Resident A was swearing while Staff 1 was trying to tell him to\ncalm down prior to the restraint. He also reports that Resident A was trying to choke\nStaff 1 while they were lying on the ground, which caused him to grab Resident A’s\narm. He ended by reporting that the program has “greatly helped” him and that he\nhas felt safe while in the program.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 3/2/2021. He reports remembering the\nincident and stated, “I know the restraint was inappropriate”. At first, he denied any\n“ill will” towards Resident A but later admitted that he was emotionally dysregulated\nover Resident A’s behaviors. He also reports that Resident A has a history of making\nthreats and acting on them. He described the situation,\nWe were in night procedures and I told him he can’t have any candy at\nthis time. Resident A told me that if he does not get what he wants, he will\nnot cooperate with staff. Resident A said that he would make tonight hell if\nhe does not get his snack. Resident A then threw a beverage on me and\nwalked out of the kitchen. Then he picked up a computer and threw it\nacross the room. This is when I attempted to put him into an interim\ntemporary control position, but we fell to the floor when I lost my balance. I\nlet him up and he walked back to his room.\nStaff 1 reported making a mistake and should not have restrained Resident A. He\nalso reported that his technique for the restraint was not what he was taught by the\nfacility and that he should have focused more on the de-escalation of the situation.\nHe ended by admitting that he was emotionally upset over Resident A threatening to\nmake the unit “hell” and was “tired of Resident A” repeatedly acting out.\nI interviewed the Case Manager by phone on 3/4/2021. She reports “struggling\nwith Resident A’s family’s resistance to communicating with him about their lack of\ninvolvement in his treatment. She also reports being open to having a trauma\nassessment completed with Resident A so the appropriate treatment can be\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "obtained.\nI interviewed Staff 2 by phone on 3/5/2021. She began the interview by stating,\n“the restraint was not needed, and it was not appropriate”. She reported that\nResident A threw the computer but not in anyone’s direction. She also reported a\nbelief that Staff 1 was “at his wits end with Resident A”. She reports being in the\noffice working on resident medication when she observed the “computer in the air”.\nShe also reports that she came out of the office and observed “Resident A walking\naway when Staff 1 grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the floor”. She\nreported that she kept telling Staff 1 to let Resident A go during the restraint because\n“Staff 1 was laying on top of Resident A”. She ended the interview by stating, “the\nwhole thing was crap”.\nI reviewed the following documents:\nVideo Recording: The video footage provided the following documentation:\n20:45:04 Camera 3: Staff 1 has his back to Resident A and Resident A appears to\nthrow something against Staff 1.\n20:45:09 Resident A walks out of the room and Staff 1 begins to follow him.\n20:45:13 Resident A picks up a computer monitor and throws in towards the center\nof the room. The computer CPU hits Resident A in the back as it is connected to the\nmonitor.\n20:45:16 Resident A is walking away from the computer and Staff 1 comes up from\nbehind him and wraps his arms around him and both fall to the ground.\n20:45:20 Resident A is laying on the ground with Staff 1 on top of him. Staff 2 enters\nthe room and two residents come out of their rooms.\n20:45:22 Staff 1 is wrestling with Resident A who appears to be resisting. Staff 2\nbegins to leave the room and Resident C begins to approach the restraint.\n20:45:27 Resident C grabs Resident A’s arm and Staff 1 remains on top of Resident\nA. Staff 2 is standing near the restraint.\n20:45:36 Resident C who is assisting grabs a leg while holding an arm of Resident\nA. Staff 1 continues to wrestle with Resident A and Staff 2 continues to stand\nnearby.\n20:45:40 Resident B begins to approach the restraint while Staff 2 leaves the room.\nResident C is still holding a leg and an arm while Staff 1 continues to wrestle (on\ntop) with Resident A.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "20:45:49 Resident B grabs an arm of Resident A and Staff 2 walks back into the\nroom.\n20:46:02 Resident B stands next to the restraint while Resident C continues to hold\na leg and arm.\n20:46:15 Staff 1 stands up and assists Resident A in getting up as does Resident C\nwho helped with the restraint.\n20:46:21 Resident C grabs Resident A to keep him from moving towards Staff 1.\n20:46:26 Resident C lets go of Resident A and Resident A begins to walk away.\nStaff 1 stands against the wall next to Resident B.\n20:46:48 Resident B and Resident C begin cleaning up the computer from the floor\nwhile Resident A is pacing back and forth in the room. Staff 1 has left the room and\nStaff 2 is back in the room.\n20:46:55 The supervisor enters the room and Resident A continues to pace.\n20:47:00 The supervisor follows Resident A to his room and Staff 1 reenters the\nroom. This is the end of the recording.\nIncident Report: The following narrative is from the incident report (113420175)\ndated 2/28/21. The staff involved are identified as Staff 1 and Staff 2, while the\nresident is identified as Resident A.\nAfter snack time, Resident A became frustrated that he could not get food\nout of his snack box. He was directed to leave the kitchen and head back\nto his room. Resident A walked into the common area and picked up the\nstudent computer and threw it across the room. Staff 1 physically\nintervened shortly after Resident A threw the computer. Staff 1’s physical\nintervention took Resident A to the floor. Emergency procedures were\ncalled. While on the floor, Resident C and Staff 1 helped Resident A back\nto his feet. Resident A walked around the common area for a short period\nof time and then walked into his room. Supervisor 1 arrived to assist and\nwas able to establish therapeutic rapport with Resident A. A wellness\ncheck was done on Resident A, and he stated that he did not have any\ninjuries or concerns.\nBehavior Management philosophy and procedures policy: The policy states the\nfollowing:\nIn providing residential treatment it is inevitable that there are times when\na student is out of control and will need a physical intervention. Such\nsituations are used when there is a clear risk of imminent harm to self, to\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "others or in the likelihood of significant property damage. Any physical\nbehavior management intervention will be used as a last resort and after\nnonphysical techniques are exhausted. To promote safety a team\napproach (two or more staff) is the expected practice when intervening\nwith acting out students. Single person physical intervention should not\noccur unless there is imminent risk of assault, injury, or serious property\ndamage and additional, staff assistance is not immediately available.\nEmergency floor procedures are no longer permitted based on the new\nemergency rules provided by the State. In the event that a restraint ends\nup on the floor due to the student struggling the staff have the following\noptions:\n Disengage with the youth. If the youth is still exhibiting\ndangerous behaviors and meets the criteria for physical\nmanagement, staff are able to reengage the student once he\nstands up.\n Help bring the student back up to his knees or a standing\nposition. This needs to be done without the use of force (i.e.\ndragging or pulling a student to one of these positions).\n If a student begins to struggle while in an escort or team\ncontrol, staff can utilize one of the escort positions that allow\nfor the student to be in a seated position.\nStaff 1 Human Resources (HR) Records: As stated by Administrator 1, there is not\ndocumentation of any disciplinary action with Staff 1 in his HR file prior to the\nallegations in this report. Documentation in the file indicates that Staff 1 completed\nall required training including the behavior management training (NVCI) used by the\nfacility along with Trauma Informed Care training. Further documentation indicates\nthat Staff 1 also received training in behavior management since the allegations.\nCounseling Statement (write up) for Staff 1: This document states the following:\nOn 2/28/21 you restrained a resident and the restraint did not align with the\npolicy and procedures of NVCI. It was observed that you took a student to the\nfloor by yourself. Additionally, although the student was escalated and threw\nthe computer, he was walking away from you at the time, other options should\nhave been exercised first. This documentation also indicates that Staff 1 must\nbe retrained in the behavior management techniques of NVCI.\nCounseling Statement (write up) for Staff 2: This document states the following:\nThere was an incident that resulted in a restraint with a student on 2/28/21. Your\npartner engaged physically with the student and you did not assist. This is against\nthe teaching of NVCI, if your partner engages in physical management you must\nassist to ensure the safety of both students and staff involved. You should also direct\nstudents to their rooms during emergency procedures so that you are able to\nrespond to the crisis.\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
    "Investigation Summary dated 3/1/20. This document outlines the actions taken by\nthe facility to deal with the allegations, beginning with a review of the camera footage\nand ending with the interviews.\nNon-Violent Crisis Intervention Manual: I reviewed the specific physical behavior\nmanagement techniques that are approved to use at the facility. These techniques\nall require two staff members and remain in the standing position for all involved.\nNone of the techniques reviewed (approved by the facility) match the technique used\nby Staff 1 during his physical intervention with Resident A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nRule 1 Prohibition of Prone Restraint; Procedures Involving Other\nRestraints in Child Caring Institutions\n(2) Resident restraint must be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child's behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident's treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Evidence provided through interviews, written documentation\nand a video recording do support the allegations of Staff 1 and\nStaff 2 not performing an appropriate restraint of Resident A.\nBoth Staff 1 and Staff 2, along with Administrator 1 stated that\nthe restraint was not performed as required and taught to the\nstaff at the facility. The video recording shows that the restraint\nwas not according to policy and procedure.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n235 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE  PO BOX 30037\n LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909\nwww.michigan.gov/mdhhs  517-373-3740",
