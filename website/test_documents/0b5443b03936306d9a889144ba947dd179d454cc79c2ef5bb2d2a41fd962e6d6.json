Child placing agencies will\ncontinue to use the DHHS-69, Action Summary template. This\nform also serves as notice to the courts of changes in\nplacements, parent's living situation and the FC worker/agency,\nas identifying information is indicated. The FC/JJ action\nsummary meets licensing requirements for replacement\ndocumentation (See FOM 722-03) and in most cases, agency\ntransfer and case closing summary (see below). The FC/JJ\naction summary must also be used for foster care transfer to\nadoption.\nWhich Cases/When:\nAll foster care cases where there is:\n1. A replacement.\n2.

This involved three of\neleven placement changes documented in the files.\nSix of eight closed foster care case files reviewed did not have documentation of the\nrequired DHHS-69 Action Summary for the case closing. This involved five missing\nAction summaries and an action summary developed on 10/16/19 for a closing that\ntook place on 8/28/19.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION FROM THE 2019 RENEWAL INSPECTION WITH\nAN APPROVED CAP ON 2/13/2019.\n6",

Foster\ncare workers need to ensure the parent understands all areas\nwithin the agreement. Parents and youths age 14 and older\nmust sign the PATP. If a parent or youth is unavailable or\nrefuses to sign the PATP, foster care workers must identify, and\ndocument additional action needed to secure the parent’s\nand/or youth’s participation in service planning and compliance\nwith the PATP. As the goals are achieved, modified or\nexpanded, the updated PATP will reflect this process. Parents\nand youths age 14 and older must participate in the\ndevelopment of each updated treatment plan, allowing for\nopportunity to evaluate their progress towards completing goals.\nCI 17-096 Treatment Plan Signature Timeframes and\nDocumentation Requirements\nWhen the treatment plan is completed, signatures for all\nappropriate case members must be obtained.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas\n The agency was using an outdated foster parent/agency agreement form.\nThe agency agreed that they need to update their forms to reflect\nappropriate information.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n The agency did not seek any consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted two acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nThe first investigation requiring a corrective action plan involved allegations of the\nagency’s assessment of a specific home and the timeliness in assessing a\nhousehold member. A complete investigation resulted in a finding that the agency\ndid not complete and submit a timely CAP related to the clearance and assessment\n10",
    "of a household member. Additional findings were discovered and involved a special\nevaluation exceeding 90-days without approval from the Chief Administrator or\ndesignee. There was also no documentation to justify the delay in the report being\ncompleted. The agency submitted a CAP that involved the worker establishing a\nlicensing violation rather than a safety plan and the supervisor not approving a\nsafety plan if a CAP is more appropriate. The CAP for the second violation involves\nthe caseworker being trained on the timeline of a Special Evaluation and the\nsupervisor developing a tracking system for Special Evaluations.\nThe second corrective action plan involved the agency’s 2019 renewal licensing\ninspection.\nSafety Alerts:\nThere were three safety alerts documented during the visit by the Analyst\nAlert #1\nConcerns: The licensed home was using portable electric heaters in the bedrooms\nat the time of the visit. The licensed home had an electrical outlet that did not have a\ncover on it at the time of the visit. This was the light switch at the end of the hallway\nwhere the bedrooms are located.\nResolution: The agency provided documentation that the caseworker addressed\nthese issues with the family and the necessary changes were made. The agency\ndocumented that the family understood that they are not to use the portable heater\nand that they agreed to remove the portable heater. The agency also provided a\npicture of the electrical outlet with a cover as required.\nAlert #2\nConcerns: The relative home was using a portable electric heater in the master\nbedroom at the time of the visit. The relative home currently has all of the boys in\none-bedroom upstairs (which does not appear to be big enough for all children) as\nthey are doing construction and painting on the other room. The relative stated that\nthey did not discuss a timeline for completion of the work with the agency.\nResolution: The agency provided documentation that the issues have been\nresolved. They reported that the family “removed the heater immediately” and\n“understand that they cannot use a portable heater”. Documentation provided\nindicates that a safety plan was developed and signed by the foster parent. They\nprovided documentation that the family followed through with the ceiling being\nrepaired and painted within the required 14-days outlined in the safety plan.\nAlert #3\n11",
    "Concerns: The relative stated that their carbon monoxide detector does not work,\nand that they do not currently have working smoke detectors. The electricity is not\ncurrently working in parts of the master bedroom, master bathroom, and the laundry\nroom. The foster children's bedroom, the adoptive children's bedroom, and the living\nroom all have broken windows. The relative stated that the agency was helping them\nwith the windows but were unsure when this would be completed. The relative\nindicated that the roof on the home was recently leaking, and that they were unsure\nif it was still leaking. There are observable water spots on several parts of the ceiling\nin the home.\nResolution: The agency provided documentation that the identified issues were\ninvestigated and resolved. The agency completed a face-to-face inspection on\n2/7/2020 and obtained pictures of the damage to the ceiling and windows. They also\ndetermined that there is electricity in the master bedroom, master bathroom and\nlaundry room. They documented that not all of the outlets were working at this time.\nIt is also documented that the caregiver agreed not to allow the children in the three\nareas (master bedroom, master bathroom and laundry room). They indicated that\nthe children are not normally in these areas of the house. The agency scheduled to\nhave the windows inspected and measured for repairs on 2/11/2020. This is\ndocumented as having occurred and the agency provided documentation of the\ninstallation having been completed on all three windows by 3/2/2020. There is\ndocumentation that the installation was delayed due to weather issues. In regard to\nthe fire detector and carbon monoxide detector, the agency provided documentation\nthat these were installed in December 2019. The agency documented that at the\ntime of this report, the electrician is scheduled to begin working on repairing all of the\nidentified electrical issues, which should occur the week of 3/16/2020. In regard to\nthe roof issues, the agency documented that the caregiver is in the process of\nobtaining quotes for a grant to have the roof repaired. They also provided\ndocumentation that the roof is not actively leaking at this time but does need repair.\nThere is documentation that the agency is scheduled to have a meeting with the\ncaregiver on 3/9/2020 to get an update on the roof repair schedule.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility continue on a\nregular license.\n12",
