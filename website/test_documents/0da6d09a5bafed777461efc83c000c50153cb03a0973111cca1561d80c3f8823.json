    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth has displayed self-harming/suicidal behaviors on multiple occasions since\nJanuary 2022 and the facility has not provided appropriate mental health evaluations\nin response.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 3/29/22 alleging on 1/12/22 Youth A tied a shoestring\naround her neck and said she wanted to die. Youth A also had three superficial cuts\non her arm that were believed to have been self-inflicted. On 2/7/22 Youth A jammed\nher door with a sock where staff were unable to gain entry and then took a cord from\nher room and attempted to strangle herself with it. On 3/28/22 Youth A tied a cord\naround her neck and expressed suicidal ideations. The facility did not seek a mental\nhealth evaluation for Youth A after any of these incidents.\nInterviews:\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/31/22 along\nwith the DHHS Worker. She reported after the 1/12/22 and 2/7/22 incidents Youth A\nwas placed on at risk precautions. The incident on Monday (3/28/22) the staff did not\ncall the therapist to have Youth A placed on at risk precautions.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/31/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. She said things are good on the unit. She has no issues with staff or her\npeers. She has no issues with the facility and likes being there. On Monday Youth A\ntook a string and put it around her head. Staff 4 pulled it tighter when she tried to\ntake it off Youth A. Youth A said she did not want to hurt herself. She said the string\nwas a cord from the TV. She only had it around her neck for 10 seconds. She said\nthe staff always stop her when she tries to hurt herself. She did not do anything else\nto try and hurt herself. She did it because she did not get what she wanted. She was\nin the milieu by the TV. Staff 3 and Staff 4 were there. Youth A said she is safe at\nthe facility. Whenever she does something like this, they process with her afterwards\nand she meets with her therapist one time a week and a doctor every two weeks.\nYouth A's therapist (Therapist) was interviewed face to face at the facility on 3/31/22\nalong with the DHHS Worker. Therapist thinks she was contacted regarding the\n1/12/22 incident but could not recall specifically. She stated Youth A was not\nsuicidal, but she was placed on precaution just to be safe. Therapist reported Youth\nA threatens self-harm as a form of attention seeking. Therapist has a Limited\nLicense Master Social Worker (LLMSW). Therapist stated she is qualified to\ndetermine if Youth A needs an further assessments following these incidents.\nTherapist also could not recall the 2/7/22 incident. She reported at no time has\nYouth A required outside mental health treatment. Youth A did not do anything that\n4",
    "left marks or actually tied anything around her neck. None of the incidents ever\nresulted in a restraint. Staff direct Youth A to stop, and she stops. Youth A does\nthese things when she is told no.\nTherapist stated, on Monday 3/28 she did not know that Youth A threatened to harm\nherself until Tuesday. The staff should have called her, but they did not. She\nbelieves they called Supervisor. This is the first time Therapist had concerns about\nnot being notified. Therapist completes her own assessment and uses a precaution\ntable to help make a decision to put the youth on precaution or not. Nine times out of\nten the youth will go on precaution just to be safe. She documents her assessment\non the Suicide precaution form. If she is at the facility, she will complete the form. If\nshe is not at the facility, staff will complete the form and she will sign it the next time\nshe is at the facility.\nThe Program Supervisor (Supervisor) was interviewed face to face at the facility\nalong with the DHHS Worker on 3/31/22. She reported on 3/28/22 the staff had\ncalled her and updated her on what Youth A was doing. They were asking for help\nwith interventions. Youth A was targeting one staff. She told them to remove the\naudience and the one staff. Youth A was threatening a peer and Staff 1. The staff\nreported when Youth A went for a cord, Staff 3 stepped in and told her to stop, and\nYouth A stopped. Youth A was de-escalated at that point. Supervisor did not know if\nYouth A wrapped the cord around her neck. Staff 4 was a guest staff that night, so\nStaff 3 stepped in to de-escalate. From Supervisor’s phone conversation she\ninterpreted that Staff 3 and Staff 4 knew what was going on and Youth A was not\nsuicidal. Youth A was targeting others. Youth A went for the cord, but Supervisor\ncould not say if Youth A was self-harming.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/13/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. She reported she was helping on Youth A's unit the night of 3/28/22. She\nsaid Youth A was going around the unit saying she would hit Staff 1. Youth A was\nupset because she was grounded and could not go to the Coffee House. Youth A\nwrapped a cord around her neck, but Staff 4 got the cord before Youth A could pull it\ntight. Staff 4 said she just grabbed the cord and Youth A let go. Staff 4 and Staff 3\nde-escalated Youth A who stated she felt hopeless but not suicidal. Once Youth A\nwas de-escalated, she left and went back to her unit. She thought Staff 3 called the\ntherapist, but she was not sure.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/13/22 along with the DHHS\nWorker. She reported she was present during an incident in February in which Youth\nA tied a cord around her neck. She reported Youth A had got into a fight with Youth\nB. Youth A was in her bedroom when she jammed a Croc in her door so it could not\nbe opened by staff. Youth A then tied something around her neck. Staff 3 processed\nwith Youth A. Youth A then let staff into her room. The on-call therapist was\ncontacted. Staff 2 stated she has rarely seen Youth A self-harm. If a youth is\ndisplaying self-harming behaviors, then the staff are to contact the therapist, and the\n5",

Youth B was in the shower and heard noises, so she\nstepped out momentarily in a towel to see what was going on. When Youth B\nstepped out of the shower, Youth A grabbed her by the towel, kissed her,\nthen touched Youth B's vagina. Though staff were present for the fight, and\nYouth A and Youth B were within sight of the altercation, the staff were not\notherwise aware and did not see this occur.
