Youth A was provided with first\naide for the rug burn and was examined by the Nurse on\n06/19/2024. On 06/24/2024 Youth A went to his room for the\nnight, but when Staff 3 walked off the unit, Youth A came out of\n2",
    "his room. She said Youth A must have held the doorknob, so his\ndoor didn’t lock. This was the first time that Youth A got out of his\nroom after the doors were locked. She said the control room has a\ncomputer monitor that lets them know when the bedroom doors\nare locked, so she is not sure why the monitor showed all the\ndoors locked but Youth A was able to open the door. Staff 2 and\nStaff 3 tried to get Youth A to go back to his room, but he wouldn’t\nso she allowed Youth A to use the telephone. Youth A called\nCentralized Intake. She allowed Youth A to use the telephone\nthinking that would calm him down, but after the call Youth A\nrefused to go to his room and grabbed the television cord. She\nand Staff 2 attempted to verbally de-escalate but Youth A refused\nto hand over the cords. She and Staff 2 attempted a standing\nrestraint to escort Youth A to his room, but Youth A started to fight\nthem by biting and kicking them, so they all fell on the floor. Youth\nA was again restrained on the floor by Supervisor, Staff 1, Staff 2\nand Staff 3 until he calmed down. Youth A is currently being\nmonitored closely by staff due to the second incident and the\ntherapist has been meeting with Youth A. Supervisor denied\nYouth A had a difficult time breathing or was in any distress while\nbeing restrained.\nYouth A was interviewed at the facility on 06/25/2024, in\nconjunction with MDHHS Specialist. Youth A reported he is\ncurrently on restrictions due to running out of his room and using\nthe telephone.

Youth A was\nrestrained on the floor, because Youth A started to kick, and spit\non staff. She and Staff 2 were holding Youth A’s wrist and\nSupervisor was holding Youth A’s shoulders. Youth A did attempt\nto spit on Supervisor while being restrained on the floor.
