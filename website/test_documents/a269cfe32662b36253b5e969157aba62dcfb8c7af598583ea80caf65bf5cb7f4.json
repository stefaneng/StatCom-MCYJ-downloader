This staff member has also vaped in front of the\nyouths on more than one occasion.\nInvestigation Interviews\nCase Manager, Youth A, Youth B, Youth C\nOn 12/23/2024 I spoke with Case Manager and interviewed Youth\nA, Youth B and Youth C with MDHHS (Michigan Department of\nHealth and Human Services) Worker who was onsite, and I was\navailable via a Face-time call. I also interviewed Case Manager\nby telephone on 12/23/2024.\nCase Manager reported a concern about Staff 1 came up while\nshe was on vacation on 12/10/2024 and her supervisor,\nIndependent Living Plus Supervisor (ILPS) brought the matter to\nher attention on or about 12/16/2024. She reported there had\napparently been a meeting between Staff 2 and Staff 3 with ILPS\nover concerns related to Staff 1. Case Manager did not indicate a\ndate for that meeting. She reported being informed that during\nthat meeting an issue of Staff 1 not taking vapes from the youths,\nand Staff 1 possibly vaping with the girls was brought up by Staff 2\nand Staff 3. She reported youths are prohibited from smoking\n2",
    "cigarettes, having vapes, or other substances on the property. Nor\nare staff to use any substances with the youth. Case Manager\nreported the staff are supposed to confiscate the prohibited items,\nif they are seen, or reported to be on the property. Staff are to also\ninform her and log the discovery of the said object in their log\nbook.\nCase Manager reported their talks with the youths about this\nconcern had a mixed conclusion as to whether Staff 1 was\nsmoking/ vaping, or had not taken vapes from youth when Staff 1\nmay have observed a youth with such an item. She reported\nYouth A and Youth D both reported Staff 1 had vaped around or\nwith youths. Additionally, Staff 1 had seen youths with vapes and\nStaff 1 had not taken the items from the youths. She reported\nalthough Youth A and Youth D reported the information as\nindicated above for Staff 1, other youths denied that type of\nincident had occurred involving Staff 1. Case Manager did not\nname those youths. Case Manager said she has never caught\nYouth A with any vapes, but Youth A admitted to buying a vape.\nYouth A reporting doing so, because she was curious about it.\nCase Manager did not know where Youth A or any youth may\nhave gotten the vapes. Nor did she believe Youth A was actively\nvaping. She said Youth A admitted to trying the vape she\npurchased, not liking it, and giving the vape to a staff. Case\nManager reported no staff told her about Youth A having a vape.\nNor did a staff log the matter into the home’s communication log\nwhich is required. Case Manager reported Youth A told her Staff 1\nwas the staff that took the vape.\nCase Manager reported on 12/19/2024 Staff 1 was placed on\nadministrative leave pending an investigation. She reported this is\nthe second discipline issue for Staff 1 since Staff 1’s 7/3/2024\nemployment. The first disciplinary action was a written action on\n11/21/2024 related to Staff 1 giving her personal phone number to\nthe girls which is against policy. Case Manager reported with this\ncurrent situation, prior to Staff 1 being placed on leave Staff 1\nreportedly went to each of the girls and told each of them that\nanother youth told on her. Case Manager reported that was not\nsomething Staff 1 should have done. She reported after Staff 1 left\nthe premises, the girls went after each other by arguing, and\nsaying some youths had snitched on Staff 1. Case Manager\nreported a big commotion came due to the girls arguing, and it led\nto a physical incident between Youth A and Youth D where the\npolice had to be called.\n3",
    "Youth A admitted to knowing the Independent Living (IL) house\nrules, and the law around not vaping, smoking or purchasing such\nsubstances if one is under age 21. As it related to these\nallegation, Youth A stated she was not a snitch, and she refused\nto talk with MDHHS Worker and myself.\nYouth B reported all the girls in the IL house use nicotine vapes\nexcept for Youth A. She said the girls in the house smoke every\nday, but they don’t do so around staff, so staff can’t do anything\nabout it. Youth B reported Staff 1 has never given her or other\nyouth vapes. She reported Staff 1 has smoked vapes when Staff\n1 has transported her and other youth in Staff 1’s car. Youth B\nsaid Staff 1 has smoked every time she has gotten into Staff 1’s\ncar. She did not report how many times Staff 1 had smoked with\nher and or other youth in the car. She reported staff use their\npersonal cars to transport them at least two times per week; and\nStaff 1 had vaped while driving them more than once.\nAs to whether Staff 1 contributed to the commotion that occurred\nwith youths that lead to the police being called, Youth B admitted\nto being present and that sometime that day she had heard Staff 1\nstate “I don’t know why she snitched on me”. She said Staff 1 got\nsnitched on for something Youth A and Youth D did.\nYouth C denied seeing any of the youths in the home use\nsubstances, but she admitted to seeing Staff 1 do so. She said\nStaff 1 has transported them in Staff 1’s car and on at least two\noccasions Staff 1 had smoked a vape. She said Staff 1 did not tell\nher not to report it. Staff 1 also never offered her, or any other\nyouth to her knowledge, a vape.\nIndependent Living Plus Supervisor (ILPS)\nOn 1/2/2025 I interviewed ILPS by telephone. ILPS confirmed the\nallegations stated in the complaint. She also confirmed information\nas reported by Case Manager related to Staff 2 and Staff 3\ncoming to her with concerns about Staff 1 and this being Staff 1’s\nsecond disciplinary incident. ILPS said Youth A came to her and\nreported that Staff 1 had vaped at the house. Youth A also\nreported another youth in the home had a vape and Staff 1 did not\ntake the vape from the youth. Youth A did not tell ILPS the other\nyouth’s name. ILPS stated given that Case Manager has a better\nrelationship with Youth A, and the other youths she had Case\nManager to speak with the youths about the matter. The outcome\nof those conversations resulted in the allegations reported in the\ncomplaint.\n4",
    "Staff 1\nOn 1/2/2025 I interviewed Staff 1, with MDHHS Worker by way of\na Facetime call, while DHHS Worker was onsite at Staff 1’s home.\nStaff 1 reported she had been placed on administrative leave from\nher job due to an altercation that happened between youths,\nwhich had started with an argument over her. Staff 1 denied\nknowing what that incident was and denied going to the youths\nand asking them whether they had snitched on her. She reported\nknowing that all the youths in the home use substances. She said\nthey smoke weed, tobacco, and drink alcohol. She denied\nsmoking with, or giving any youths vapes, or witnessing any youth\nvape. She reported the agency’s policy around drug use for the\nyouths at the IL home is that they cannot use substances at the\nhouse or on the property. Additionally, that if a staff catches a\nyouth with a substance they are to take the item from the youth\nand report it to the supervisor.\nMDHHS Worker advised Staff 1 that this complaint indicated\nYouth A had a vape, which Staff 1 did not confiscate. Staff 1\nattempted to explain what occurred. She reported during shift on\nSunday (Staff 1 did not clarify the exact date) Youth A was talking\nwith her in the office. Youth A reported she had been hanging with\nother youths who vape, but said she does not smoke weed.\nYouth A told her she gave in to peer pressure and bought a vape.\nStaff 1 reported she expressed to Youth A that she thought Youth\nA did not vape, and asked Youth A why she bought the vape.\nYouth A told her she would give the vape away and Staff 1 asked\nYouth A to give the vape to her. Staff 1 said Youth A told Case\nManager about the incident when Case Manager came on the\npremises. Staff 1 said she removed the vape. Staff 1 did not say\nspecifically what she did with the vape. She said she did not have\nto give it to a supervisor to dispose of it. She said she did not\nwrite the situation up. She was not sure why she did not write it in\nthe log. She said she just spoke with Case Manager about the\nvape at the end of her shift. She subsequently said it was the first\ntime she had confiscated a vape from a youth, and so she didn’t\nknow what to do. She said she spoke with Case Manager about\nthe vape the next day. She admitted there was another incident\nwhere she saw Youth E, with a vape, and she took it. She\nreported this incident was after the one with Youth A and she\ndisposed of the vape and wrote the matter up in the notes.\nStaff 1 reported the agency’s policy around staff smoking\ncigarettes or using vapes is that staff cannot do so on the\npremises or around the youths. Staff 1 denied vaping on the\npremises, or with youths, but admitted she has vaped nicotine in\n5",
    "her vehicle when youths were in the back seat. This was when\nshe transported youths to appointments. She reported not\nbelieving the youths could see her vaping in the front seat. She\nreported her vaping with a youth in the car had not been a regular\noccurrence as it had occurred less than five times.\nStaff 2 & Staff 3\nOn 1/2/2025 during separate telephone calls MDHHS Worker and\nI interviewed Staff 2 and Staff 3. Staff 2 has worked for the\nagency for two months and Staff 3 has been employed at the\nagency since July 2024. Both reported similar information as Case\nManager related the agency’s policy related to substance\npossession and use by IL youths. Staff 2 reported staff are to\nabide by similar rules of not using substance on the premise and\nthey cannot consume any drugs/substances with youth. Staff 3\nwas not sure of the policy governing staff in this area, but\nsurmised if youths cannot used on the premises, nor should staff.\nStaff 2 reported confiscated items like vapes are to be placed in\nthe staff’s closet and reported to the supervisor. She reported\nbeing aware of Staff 1, their team leader, violating that protocol on\nat least one occasion. She reported about a month prior to this\ninterview she had confiscated a vape (she did not report who\nfrom) and she put the vape in the staff’s closet. She said at some\npoint that day she spoke with Staff 1 about the vape and Staff 1\ntold her not to dispose of it. Staff 1 told her Staff 1 would dispose\nof the vape. Staff 2 said when she checked on the vape later, it\nwas gone and there was no note documented about it by Staff 1.\nStaff 2 further reported that about two weeks ago Youth A\nreported she and Staff 1 had vaped together in Staff 1’s car while\nStaff 1 was transporting her. Staff 2 said she did not report\naforementioned incident to Case Manager at the time, because\nshe knows that at times the girls will embellish things. She said\nshe had been uncomfortable reporting matter to Staff 1 due to\nStaff 1 tendency to be condescending and rude. She recently\nbrought up Staff 1’s behavior with ILPS and Case Manager.\nStaff 3 reported she works the third shift and youths are usually\nsleeping when she is on shift. She denied catching any youth with\nor using substances. Nor had she witnessed any staff using any\nsubstances with or around a youth. Staff 3 reported an awareness\nof two incidents involving vapes and Staff 1. She reported Staff 2\nhad mentioned to her that Youth A had been hanging with some\nyouths who smoke, and Youth A had bought a vape. Staff 3 said\nYouth A admitted to her she had started vaping. Youth A also told\n6",
    "her she really did not like vaping; and she handed the vape over\nto Staff 1. Youth A told her she gave the vape to Staff 1 because\nStaff 1 vapes. Staff 3 reported Youth A also reported that Staff 1\nhad purchased vapes for her and Youth F who left the IL home\ntwo months ago.\nStaff 4 & Youth D\nStaff 4 and Youth D were interviewed by MDHHS Worker and I by\ntelephone on 1/7/2025 and 1/8/2025 respectively.\nStaff 4 reported being an Intern at the IL home since August\n2024. She reported information similarly to Staff 3 as it relates to\nwhat staff are to do about youths using or possessing substances,\nnicotine vape, etc. and the rule for staff related to them not using\nsubstance on the premises. She denied ever witnessing a staff\nsmoke or use nicotine vapes in front of youths. Nor had she heard\nof any staff doing such. If staff confiscate substances from a\nyouth, Staff 4 reported the item is to be disposed of off the\nproperty so that the youth cannot get it. She reported Case\nManager has reported disposing of items at a dumpster or gas\nstation.\nYouth D reported living at the IL home for one year. Youth D\nconfirmed what other youths had reported about youths not being\nallowed to use or have drugs (marijuana vapes, cigarettes,\nnicotine vapes, etc.) or other paraphernalia or weapons on the\npremises. She said if they get caught with any of those items, the\nitem gets taken by Case Manager, is thrown away, and they get a\nconsequence. Youth D admitted she had an altercation with\nYouth A that resulted in staff calling the police. She said because\nof their altercation they are both getting kicked out. She said she\ntold Youth A that Youth A snitched on Staff 1 and now Staff 1 is\ngetting fire for vaping and talking about her sex life with youths.\nYouth D further admitted she had seen Staff 1 vaping, but it was\nnot on the agency’s property. She was in the back seat of Staff\n1’s car while Staff 1 was transporting them. Youth D did not report\nwhat other youth was in the car with her. She reported it was\nclear that they could see Staff 1 vaping from the back seat. She\nsaid it was not a secret what Staff 1 was doing. Staff 1 was not\nhiding it. Youth D denied any staff knowing about this matter.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nI had contact with CA initially on 12/23/2024 by email about the\nallegation. She reported awareness of the concerns because the\nagency reported them. Subsequently on 1/9/2025 and 1/10/2025\nvia email, CA provided some clarifications related the agency’s\n7",
    "policy. CA reported staff do sometimes transport youth in their\nown vehicles and according to the agency’s policy, smoking would\nbe prohibited during any time staff are working and clocked in.\nDocumentation Review:\n• The agency’s Search & Prohibited Items Policy which\nincluded illegal drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, legal prescription\ndrugs not prescribed for the individual and drug\nparaphernalia as items prohibited.\n• Staff 1’s training record showing her training on various\nagency topics.\n• The agency’s no smoking policy, which indicated in keeping\nwith Samaritas’ healthy work environment and complying\nwith Michigan’s No-Smoke law, smoking is prohibited at all\ntimes in all Samaritas communities, on all Samaritas\nproperty, including Samaritas vehicles and parking lots.\nAlso, that employees are expected to maintain the agency’s\ncommitment to a professional image and utilize the\nprograms and services available to avoid smoking/tobacco\nuse during the workday and to avoid exposing others to\nsecond hand smoke. Additionally, that if employees choose\nto smoke or use tobacco products, smoking must be done\nduring meal and break time, with supervisory approval.\nAnalysis Based on interviews, documents reviewed, Staff 1’s own\nadmission of vaping while transporting youths, and Staff 1 not\nreporting when or how she disposed of a vape she confiscated\nfrom a youth Staff 1 did not adhere to agency policies and did not\ndemonstrate responsible character suitable and able to meet the\nneeds of children.\nConclusion Violation Established.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent license status is recommended.\nFebruary 25, 2025\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\n8",
