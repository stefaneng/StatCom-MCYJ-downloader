DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe agency is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the following:\nRule 400.4146 Immunizations\n(1) A resident shall have current immunizations\nas required by the department of community\nhealth.\nOne of two youths was admitted on 2/6/23 with six overdue vaccinations. The\nfacility was to have commenced immunizations no later than 3/8/23.\n2",
    "IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• I clarified with the social service worker that treatment plans should not be printed\nand signed at the beginning of the period under review. Rather, they should be\nprinted and signed at the end of the timeframe so all of the information within that\ntimeframe pulls from the data system into the report. Social service worker\nshould also be sure that the youth's progress toward each identified goal is\ndocumented in the updated treatment plans.\n• I explained that immunization records (MICR) should be accessed, printed and\nplaced in the youth's files within 30 days of admission. If, at the time of\nadmission, immunizations are overdue, the facility must see to it that the youth is\nvaccinated immediately unless contraindicated by a physician or the youth's\nparent/guardian objects to required vaccines on religious grounds.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• Ideas for corrective action to achieve compliance for R 146 (1) were discussed.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not been required to submit any corrective action plans during this\nperiod under review.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were identified.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThere were no investigations during this review period.\n3",
    "Staff and Youth Interviews\nLead staff asked for consultation re: programming ideas for an 18-year-old who\nalready graduated from High School. Youths reported no concerns and are content\nwith the program.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nI observed the kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, pantry and medication cabinet.\nThe facility is clean and organized. Activity schedules and meal menus are posted.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nDecember 6, 2023\n_____________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 6, 2023\n_____________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
