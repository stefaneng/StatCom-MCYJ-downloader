    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12505 Supervision\nSection • (1) An agency shall provide supervision for a youth in\nDescription independent living consistent with the youth's need for\nsupervision, as required by R 400.12504(2)(e).\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A was inappropriately touched by two other youths and\nYouth A does not feel safe.\nInvestigation Allegation was made that on an unknown date Youth C and Youth\nD groped Youth A by touching Youth A's chest and buttocks.\nAllegation was also made that on 06/12/2025 Youth B attacked\nYouth A in the bathroom and Youth A had to pepper spray Youth\nB.\nInterviews:\nDCWL Consultant 2 interviewed Youth A in person on\n06/20/2025. Youth A reported Youth A's worker would visit Youth\nA 2-3 times each month and additional times if requested by\nYouth A. Youth A alleged Youth C and Youth D groped Youth A\nmore than 5 times, but Youth A could not report any specific dates\nof the alleged occurrences. Youth A stated Youth A did not report\nany of these alleged incidents to any staff at the residence, but\nStaff 1 was in the area. Youth A did not report any information\nassociated with the complaint regarding Youth B attacking Youth\nA or Youth A pepper-spraying Youth B.\nI interviewed Foster Care Monitor by phone on 08/11/2025.\nFoster Care Monitor described Youth A as typically exaggerating\nincidents and being selective in including all the circumstances\nassociated with any reported incidents. Foster Care Monitor\ndescribed as one example where Youth A reported being hit by\nanother youth, but Youth A didn't include the fact that Youth A hit\nthe other youth first. Foster Care Monitor stated he did not have\nany concerns related to the services being provided by the agency\nin this program. Foster Care Monitor stated Foster Care Worker\nworks well with Foster Care Monitor.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker by phone on 08/19/2025.\nFoster Care Worker indicated the allegations made by Youth A\nwere never reported to staff by Youth A. Foster Care Worker\ndenied any incidents where Youth A allegedly pepper sprayed\n2",
    "Youth B on 06/12/2025. Foster Care Worker stated Youth A\npepper sprayed a staff member on 06/12/2025 when Youth A was\nmad at the staff because the staff member could not give Youth A\nthe pass code for the Wi-Fi. Foster Care Worker stated it was this\nassault on staff and Youth A's subsequent truancy that led to\nYouth A's discharge from the program.\nI interviewed Complainant by phone on 08/19/2025 and\nComplainant did not have any additional information than what\nwas reported in the initial complaint.\nI interviewed Chief Administrator and Foster Care Supervisor\nby phone on 08/19/2025. They assisted in identifying the other\nyouth reported in the allegation and facilitated the phone\ninterviews with Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D.\nI interviewed Youth B by phone on 08/19/2025. Youth B denied\nassaulting Youth A in the bathroom on 06/12/2025. Youth B\ndescribed the bathrooms at the residence as having a list of\npeople on the door, but the list indicates who is responsible for\ncleaning the bathroom and not who can use the bathroom. Youth\nB stated anyone can use a given bathroom at any time as needed.\nYouth B denied being pepper sprayed by Youth A on 06/12/2025.\nI interviewed Youth C and Youth D separately by phone on\n08/19/2025. Both youth denied groping the chest and buttocks of\nYouth A. Both youth stated the residents will wrestle with each\nother as a form of play at times, but both youth denied ever\ngroping Youth A.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker 2 by phone on 08/19/2025.\nFoster Care Worker 2 denied any knowledge of the allegations\nmade by Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone on 08/20/2025. Staff 1 denied\nobserving any residents assaulting or groping Youth A. Staff 1\ndescribed Youth A as having OCD or some other condition where\nYouth A does not want to be touched. Staff 1 stated Youth A is\nvery vocal, and Youth A would have reported an incident if it\noccurred.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nI reviewed the supervision policy of this program. The level of\nsupport provided is consistent with the policy. Staff are present in\na support role for program participants.\n3",
    "I reviewed the Incident report and police report #2600010676\ndated 6/12/25 associated with Youth A’s pepper spray incident\nand discharge from this program. The police report confirms Youth\nA pepper-sprayed Staff 2 because Youth A was frustrated she\ncouldn’t access the WiFi. Youth A stated nothing physical\noccurred with Staff 2.\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance with Rule R 400.12504 (2)(e)\nper staff and youth interviews completed. Staff 1 reported Youth\nA had not made any complaints about youth groping her and Staff\n1 did not witness anything like this occurring. In addition, the\npolice report received confirms Youth A pepper-sprayed Staff 2.\nThere is no information to support Youth B was pepper-sprayed\nby anyone.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n08/19/2025\n______________________________________\nMark Hunter Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 20, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nWOC Area Manager\n4"
