Complainant reported she no longer had concerns about\nYouth A not receiving appropriate care after the incident.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/7/25\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported on\n6/27/25, he was going to commit suicide because he was anxious\nand had anxiety/depression because it was the day before the\nanniversary of his mother’s death. Youth A reported he was in his\nroom and tied pants around his neck first, and then he tied a radio\ncord around his neck. Youth A reported the cord gave him a heat\nrash around his neck, which is currently gone. Youth A reported\nhe does not remember how he felt after the incident, but reported\nhe did not have any issues with breathing afterwards. Youth A\nreported he then removed the cord and told Staff 1 about the rash\naround his neck, and said it was a heat rash. Youth A reported\nStaff 2 then got involved to help Staff 1 and gave her advice as to\nwhat to do next. Youth A reported after he went back to his room,\nStaff 2 came into his room. Youth A reported he felt anxious about\nwhat he did and lying about it, so he admitted to Staff 2 he\nwrapped the cord around his neck. Youth A reported he talked to\nStaff 2 about why he did it and Staff 2 told him he couldn’t do\nthings like that. Youth A reported Staff 2 talked to clinical on-call\nand nursing staff, which resulted in him being put on an Acute\nRisk Intervention Plan (ARIP), and items being removed from his\nroom. Youth A reported he talked to Case Manager on 6/30/25,\n2",
    "and they discussed him using his coping skills, and talking to staff\nif/when he begins having those feelings again.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 7/7/25 in collaboration with MDHHS Worker. CA\nreported Youth A’s injury on his neck after the incident on 6/27/25\nwas not serious enough to warrant outside medical care. CA\nreported Youth A was put on an ARIP on 6/27/25, and those are\nre-assessed every 24 hours to ensure continued safety. CA\nreported she talked to Youth A over the weekend of 6/27/25-\n6/29/25 and Youth A reported he was using his coping skills.

CM saw the notification\nwhen she arrived at work on 6/30/25 and checked in with Youth A.\nCM reported Youth A lied to staff initially and staff thought it was a\nmedical concern, but Youth A then opened up to staff after the\nincident and disclosed what really happened. CM reported Youth\nA walked her through the situation of what happened. Youth A told\nher he wrapped a cord around his neck because he felt like no\none cared about him or loved him. Youth A also told her “people”\nare out to get him and “people” who don’t like him want to stab\nhim. CM reported she asked Youth A who these people were, and\nhe just said “people”, but wouldn’t give any additional specifics.\nCM reported they then talked about Youth A's mother’s death a\nyear ago and processed that situation. CM reported Youth A does\nnot have the mental capacity to understand grief on his own, so\nshe helped him connect his grief with his suicidal ideations. CM\nreported she then completed a suicide risk assessment,\ndepression screening and anxiety screening. CM reported he has\nhad those assessments previously as well. CM reported he scored\nhigh frequency on those assessments, but it’s not abnormal for\nhim given his history and current feelings. CM reported his scoring\ngoes in waves, and it depends on how he’s feeling. CM reported\nthe last time he had suicidal ideations was the few weeks after his\nmother’s death. CM reported Youth A used the tie from his robe\nand wrapped it around his neck. CM reported Youth A was on\nprecautions for a month after that incident, and had all ties and\ncords removed for the entire time. CM reported Youth A showed\nno signs of suicidal ideations or increased anxiety/depression prior\nto this occurring, so there were no warning signs.

CM reported proper precautions were taken after the incident\noccurred.\nNurse was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/7/25 in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Worker. Nurse reported a staff\n(couldn’t remember who) called her on 6/27/25 and reported\nYouth A had what looked like a heat rash on his neck. Nurse\nreported there was no swelling, no itching, and no reports of Youth\nA having trouble breathing. Nurse reported she recommended\nstaff use Hydrocortisone cream for itch if needed, and requested\nthey let her know if the rash spread. Nurse reported approximately\n45 minutes later she received a call from Staff 2 stating Youth A\ndisclosed the mark on his neck was from him trying to kill himself\nby wrapping a cord around his neck. Nurse reported no additional\nmedical treatment was necessary because Youth A was not\ncomplaining of having difficulty breathing, and there was no\nswelling present. Nurse reported an ARIP was established for\nYouth A, and she told Staff 2 to call back if anything changed with\nYouth A’s status or the mark on his neck.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/16/25\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 reported on\n6/27/25, Youth A became upset with a couple different staff and\nhe talked to her about this to vent/get his feelings out, which is not\natypical for him. Staff 1 reported Youth A said he wanted to calm\ndown in his room, so she brought him to his room. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A came out within 15 minutes, stayed in the milieu for less\nthan 15 minutes, and then said he wanted to go back into his\nroom, which she allowed him to do. Staff 1 reported Youth A came\nout of his room shortly after and asked to go to the bathroom, so\nshe let him in. Staff 1 reported Youth A exited the bathroom,\nasked her about a mark on his neck and stated he didn’t know\nwhat was going on with the mark. Staff 1 reported the mark on his\nneck looked like a rash, so she consulted with Staff 2 regarding\nwhat to do for follow-up, and Staff 2 took over the situation. Staff 1\nreported she let Youth A back into his room per his request. Staff\n1 reported Staff 2 went into Youth A’s room to talk to him. When\nStaff 2 came out of Youth A’s room, she told Staff 1 Youth A\ndisclosed he wrapped a cord around his neck, and Staff 2 told\nStaff 1 to clear his room of any objects he could use to hurt\nhimself. Staff 1 reported after she cleared his room, an ARIP was\n4",

Staff 1 reported she did not speak\nwith clinical on-call or nursing staff as Staff 2 handled those calls.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/16/25\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported she was\nin the office on 6/27/25 when Staff 1 came to ask her for advice on\nhow to handle the situation because there were marks on Youth\nA’s neck. Staff 2 reported she looked at the marks on Youth A’s\nneck and it looked like an allergic reaction or a heat rash initially.\nStaff 2 reported Youth A also looked a little pale. Staff 2 reported\nshe called Nurse and then went to Youth A’s room to ask him\nquestions the Nurse wanted answers to. Nurse asked if Youth A\nwas having trouble breathing and Staff 2 reported Youth A said\nyes. Staff 2 reported Nurse advised to give Youth A allergy\nmedication if it was on his PRN list, and Staff 2 could not\nremember Nurse’s other instructions. Staff 2 reported she hung up\nthe phone and Youth A asked if he could talk to her, so she stayed\nin his room to talk to him. Staff 2 reported Youth A confided he\ntried to kill himself, and said he tried to do it with the cord to his\nradio. Staff 2 reported he did it because his mother passed away a\nyear ago and he was really overwhelmed. Staff 2 reported she\ncompleted some breathing exercises with him and created a\nsafety plan. Staff 2 reported Youth A was worried about getting\nplaced on precautions, but Staff 2 told him precautions would\nhappen to keep him safe. Staff 2 reported Youth A said he didn’t\nfeel safe with cords in his room, so she took those out\nimmediately. Staff 2 reported she told Staff 3 what was going on\nand then Staff 2 called Clinician. Staff 2 reported Clinician told her\nto strip his room of any unsafe things that could cause him harm,\nand those were taken out. Staff 2 reported Clinician recommended\nan ARIP be established for the precautions as well. Staff 2\nreported she contacted Nurse again, and Nurse recommended\nwriting an incident report, providing Youth A with an ice pack for\nhis neck, talking to clinical on-call (Clinician) and providing him\nwith his PRN medication if he requested it. Staff 2 reported she\nwas not instructed to seek additional medical care for Youth A.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/16/25\nin collaboration with MDHHS Worker.
