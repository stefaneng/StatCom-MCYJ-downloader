    "INVESTIGATION:\nOn 8/22/2022 I reviewed the complaint which indicated the above. It also indicated:\n• The foster parents have been bathing the foster youths together and the\nchildren continue to share a bed.\n• There have been difficulties working with foster care.\nOn 8/22/2022 I also spoke with the Complainant by telephone. The Complainant\nconfirmed the information in the complaint. The Complainant reported speaking with\nFoster Parent A about a children service complaint that had been received and the\ninformation indicated in this complaint was revealed. Foster Parent A reported\nhaving some difficulty working with the agency worker. The specific of those\ndifficulties was not indicated by the Complainant. The foster parent reported\nconcerns about Child C’s and Child D’s behavior. That Child C and Child D have\nbeen touching each other during bath time. The foster parent reported the agency is\naware of these behaviors. The Complainant asked Foster Parent A whether a safety\nplan had been completed by the agency related to the sexually inappropriate\nbehaviors and Foster Parent A did not seem to know what a safety plan was. The\nComplainant reported Foster Parent A indicated Child C and Child D had reported\nseeing their father sexually maltreating their sister. The reporting by the Child C and\nChild D seemed to have occurred after Foster Parent A was questioning them.\nComplainant advised Foster Parent A to stop questioning the girls about those\nthings. Foster Parent A reported not wanting to be a therapist, but reported she is\nnot getting guidance on what to do about the girls’ behaviors\nOnsite agency visit\nOn 8/24/2022 I made an onsite visit to the Children’s Center agency. At that time, I\nmet with Administrator 2, Program Manager 3, and Quality Representatives 4 related\nto the complaint allegations. I also interviewed Supervisor 5, and Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) 6. The agency affirmed that there are three foster children in Case X\nwhich this complaint relates. The children are Child C (age 4), Child D (age 6) and\nChild E (age 11). Child C and Child D are placed with Foster Parent A and Foster\nParent B, who are Children Center licensed foster parents. Child E is in placement\nwith Caregiver R. The agency denied prior awareness of the information in the\ncomplaint. They recently became aware, when FCW 6 discovered such after a late\nAugust 2022 foster home visit.\nSupervisor 5\nSupervisor 5 reported being the current supervisor for Case X. She also served in\nthe capacity of FCW for the case prior to FCW 6’s assignment to the case on\n8/4/2022.\nSupervisor 5 reported aside from the foster parents bringing to her attention, on\n7/30/2022, an incident of Child C gyrating on a belt between her legs, she was\nunaware of sexual inappropriate behavior between the girls. At a 7/30/2022 foster\nhome visit, Supervisor 5 reported discussing pediatric masturbation with the foster\n3",
    "parents; and she advised them not to shame Child C. She also later provided them\nliterature on this behavior to help them with handling the behavior.\nSupervisor 5 reported it was not until after FCW 6’s visit to the foster home on\n8/20/2022 that Supervisor 5 became aware of the sexual behavior between Child C\nand Child D, and them being bathed together. FCW 6 informed Supervisor 5 that\nthe foster parents reported when Child C and Child D were in the tub, they made\nsexually inappropriate gestures to one another. Supervisor 5 did not know the\nspecifics of those gestures, whether that information was elaborated on by the foster\nparents. Supervisor 5 reported that at the 8/20/2022 home visit, FCW 6 told the\nfoster parents to stop bathing Child C and Child D together; and to change/dress the\nchildren separately.\nSupervisor 5 reported only becoming aware of the Child C and Child D sharing the\nsame bed on 8/23/2022 during a telephone call with Foster Parent A. The purpose\nof the call was to express to Foster Parent A what more the agency could do to\nformalize a safety plan. During that telephone call Foster Parent, A shared that\nFoster Parent A puts Child C and Child D in the same bed to sleep. Foster Parent A\nreported the girls had always slept together during their placement with Caregiver W;\nand they continued that practice. Supervisor 5 advised Foster Parent A that as a\nfoster parent they must abide by departmental rules on children having their own\nbed, that Foster Parent A must not do what the relative had done by allowing the\ngirls to share a bed. Supervisor 5 said she advised Foster Parent A of Foster A’s\nand Foster Parent B’s need to check on Child C and Child D through the night.\nFurther, that if one or the other of the girls get up and get in the other’s bed, to\nremove the child and place her back in her own bed. Supervisor 5 also suggested\nto Foster Parent A that since the family has an extra room, to allow the girls to have\nseparate rooms. The agency had planned to put the latter suggestion into the safety\nplan, but Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B did not like that and refused use the\nextra room. Therefore, the agency suggested putting the girls’ beds in a way that\nthey are side to side but not so together.\nSupervisor 5 advised that the reason the agency did not know about Child C and\nChild D sharing a bed, is because each child has a twin size bed; and during\nmonthly foster home visits they saw separate beds. Also, the foster parents had not\ndisclosed that the girls share a bed.\nFoster Care Worker 6\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) 6 reported shadowing Supervisor 5 on Case X from June\nof 2022 until she assumed case responsibility in August 2022. She affirmed\ninformation reported by Supervisor 5 related to FCW 6’s contacts and efforts related\nto the 8/20/2022 foster home visit. FCW 6 reported asking Foster Parent B during\nthat home visit whether there had been any children services complaint, and Foster\nParent B responded, no, but indicated Foster Parent A (who was away during FCW\n6’s home visit) did a reporting because Child C and Child D were sexually acting out\nwith each other at bath time. Foster Parent B was not sure why Foster Parent A\n4",
    "contacted children services as opposed to the agency. FCW 6 reported prior to this\nAugust home visit she did not know that girls were acting out sexually or bathing\ntogether. She reported per her review of the case, she did not recall seeing anything\nabout the Child C and Child D having sexually acting out behaviors. At this home\nvisit FCW 6 told the foster parent to give the children separate baths starting\nimmediately. She also advised that the girls may need to sleep in different rooms;\nshould dress separately, and that a safety plan will need to be in place. FCW 6\ndocumented all this information, informed Supervisor 5 of the situation, and inquired\nabout completing a safety plan. FCW 6 said she was advised to complete a safety\nplan by Monday (8/22/2022). The agency provided me a copy of that subsequent\nsafety plan.\nFoster Parent A & Foster Parent B\nFoster Parent A was interviewed by me by telephone on 9/12/2022. Foster Parent B\nwas in the background and Foster Parent A could be heard asking him for answers\nto some of my questions as I spoke with Foster Parent A. Foster Parent A reported\nthey were Child C’s and Child D’s approved substitute care providers. They were\nalso the girls respite care providers. The girls lived with them part time and were at\none time in the home five nights on and five night off” from January 2022 until the\ngirls were officially placed in their home following their licensure in April 2022.\nFoster Parent A reported they have been reporting information about the girls\ninappropriate behaviors going back to 1/14/2022, during the time FCW 7 was the\nworker. Foster Parent A reported they would compile things that was happening\nwith the girls by way of their telephone. For example, on 1/14/2022 they informed\nFCW 7 that Child C was playing with the dog’s butt. Foster Parent A stated FCW 7\nmade a statement something like “in foster care you see stuff like this. Foster Parent\nA perceived that statement as the FCW brushing the incident off. Foster Parent A\nadmitted that FCW may have suggested something, as to what to do. What that\nFCW “thought was helpful”, but Foster Parent A could not recall the suggestion.\nFoster Parent A reported on 1/16/2022 she was rubbing one of the girl’s stomachs,\nand the child was motioning her towards the child’s private area. The sister was\ngiving a thumbs up while Foster Parent A was rubbing the child’s belly. On\n2/9/2022 they disclosed to the worker that Child C had the car seat near her vagina\narea and was humping it. Foster Parent A reported not knowing whether they were\nreporting all the incidents in real time. They were just documenting the incidents on\ntheir phone, but they had made several incident reports to the agency prior to this\ncomplaint. Those were inclusive of Child D trying to ‘grind” on Child C’s body on\n8/4/2022, which they told the agency about. Foster Parent A reported Child C and\nChild D were not constantly acting out sexually; nor were they sexually acting out at\nbedtime. The girls only did so at bath time, or when they did not have their clothes\non. Foster Parent A admits the girls were sleeping in the same bed and were being\nbathed together. The latter of which she said the agency only told her was not\npermitted three weeks prior to her interview with me. She admitted she and Foster\nParent B may not have disclosed that Child C and Child D shared a bed or were\nbathed together. The agency workers may have assumed Child C and Child D slept\n5",
    "in different beds, because each child has her own; and during home visits the\nworkers would have seen two beds. Foster Parent A reported they allowed Child C\nand Child D to share a bed, because Child C and Child D had done so when in\nplacement with Caregiver W; and they continued that. Notwithstanding this, Foster\nParent A reported the agency still knew information because Foster Parent A\nreported it during Child C’s and Child D’s Image Center’s intake and evaluation in\nJanuary 2022. The information would have been in the psychological report that was\ncompleted by the Image Center. Foster Parent A reported they just wanted\nassistance with the behaviors Child C and Child D were displaying. They did not\nknow anything about a safety plan until the children services person asked them\nabout a safety plan after Foster Parent A shared information about the girls bathing\ntogether. Foster Parent A reported when she shared with the agency that Child C\nwas humping the car seat, the worker told them that’s behavior that comes out\nduring the discovery phase of placement. Foster Parent A reported they are new\nfoster parents, the agency are rule followers, so if she and Foster Parent B were\ndoing anything inappropriate they expected the agency would tell them. She\nindicated they reached out to their foster parent navigator because they had no\nservices in place for the girls and were not sure of what to do.\nReviewed\nA review of Child C’s and Child D’s case records showed:\nChild C and Child D were placed with the agency on 9/23/2021; at which time they\nwere in the care of Caregiver W. The children were placement with Foster Parent A\nand Foster Parent B on 4/8/2022, following prior respite visits, inclusive of an\nextended visit on 3/31/2022.\nThe Imagine Center for Psychological Health report dated 4/12/2022 following a\n1/26/2022 and 3/22/2022 evaluation date that showed the following outcome related\nto both Child C and Child D:\n• On one occasion, Foster Parent A was tickling Child C and Child D gave her\na thumbs up when asked what that meant Child C began rubbing her thumb\ninappropriately (what Child C specially did with her thumb was not indicated in\nthe psychological report). That Child C and Child D may walk around\nslapping their private parts, may look in a mirror inappropriately; she and her\nsister have touched each other’s private parts.\n• Diagnostic Impressions included Reactive attachment disorder, Post\ntraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined\npresentation (provisional) for both Child C and Child D.\n• Recommendations included educational, and or speech, occupational or\npsychological therapy follow up services for both Child C and Child D related\nto their specific area of needs as specifically indicated in each child’s\npsychological report. If such concerns emerged then psychology/social work\nservices, as well as private case management services, including caregiver\nsupports, family counseling/therapy, and respite care were also\nrecommended.\n6",
    "• The family was referred to The Easter Seals of Michigan for services.\nContinued consultation with the treating physician and a reevaluation in 12\nmonths of intervention was also strongly recommended.\nSocial Work Contacts from 1/26/2022 to 8/20/2022 for caregiver home visits which\nshowed:\n• Home visits with Child C, Child D, and the relative caregiver, Caregiver W\nheld on 1/26/2022, 2/24/2022 and 3/24/2022. Child C, Child D and Caregiver\nW were interacted with/spoken to and the girls bedroom was seen. No safety\nconcerns were documented.\n• Home visits to Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s home on 4/27/2022,\n5/26/2022(via window observation and facetime due to COVID issues)\n6/15/2022(virtually due to COVID), 7/30/2022 and 8/20/2022. Each of these\nvisits indicated the children’s bedroom room was seen and denoted\ninteraction with the children and foster parents. The 4/27/2022 and 7/30/2022\nsocial work contact indicated no safety concerns reported.\n• The 5/26/2022 social work contact indicated a case update was provided to\nthe foster parent. It indicated the agency became aware that the court\nordered therapy, and also ordered parenting time with the birth father.\nAdditionally, that the foster parent reported concerns with the girls’ behaviors,\n(what those behaviors were was not documented).\n• The 6/15/2022 social work contact indicated the foster parents reported the\nchildren have been displaying really inappropriate behavior. That these\nbehaviors gives the caregiver concerns due to maltreatment being unknown\nfor Child C and Child D. That Foster Parent A reported that Child C has asked\nmen to show her their private parts; and Child C has been seen touching\nherself in front of male company. This social work contact did not indicate\nwhat, if anything the worker offered to the foster parents related to Child Cs’\nreported behaviors.\n• The 7/30/2022 social work contact did not indicate inappropriate behavior\nconcerns but indicated “No new behaviors are being demonstrated by either\nchild”. This case note did not spell out what the prior behaviors were.\n• The 8/20/2022 social contact indicated Foster Parent B was seen in the foster\nhome with Child C and Child D. That Foster Parent A was out of town. Foster\nParent B reported wanting more help with the children’s behaviors. He\nreported needing “more resources like how to handle trauma/what to do, help\nwith the things they should know...some guidance.\" Additionally, that there\nwas discussion about whether any children protective services complaints\nhad occurred since the last visit, and Foster Parent B reported Foster Parent\nA was advised by an unnamed person to make a complaint regarding sexual\nbehaviors occurring between the girls during bath time. This social work\ncontact also documented information reported by FCW 6 as reported during\nFCW 6’s interview with me related to what she advised the foster parent; and\nthe agency completing a safety plan thereafter.\n7",
    "A review of caregiver home visit sheets provided to me by the agency for 1/26/2022,\n3/24/2022; 4/27/2022, 7/30/2022; and 8/20/2022 showed information similar to what the\nMISACWIS case work contact reported.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\nANALYSIS: The evidence showed the agency staff knew or should have\nknown on or about 4/27/2022(at the time of a family team\nmeeting related to the children’s replacement) if not sooner that\nChild C and Child D were displaying inappropriate acting out\nbehaviors, some of a sexual nature. This is because some of\nthose behaviors were indicated in a psychological report\ncompleted 4/12/2022. Sexually acting out behaviors, more\nspecific to Child C was also reported by the foster parents\nduring a home visit on 6/15/2022.\nSome of these behaviors were reported during the time Foster\nParent A and Foster Parent B were providing respite care/ prior\nto the Child C’s and Child D’s placement in the couple’s newly\nlicensed foster home on 4/8/2022. The behaviors were ones\nFoster Parent A, and Foster Parent B were dealing with and\nneeded assistance with before and after the official placement\ndate, and safety planning did not occur with the foster family\nuntil 8/20/2022.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe foster care agency has not engaged the youths in needed therapy yet.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant\nOn 8/22/2022 I reviewed the complaint and spoke with the Complainant by\ntelephone. The Complainant reported it was shared with them by Foster Parent A\nthat the children in the home foster home are in need of mental health services.\nAdditionally, that the agency reports they are working on said service, but the extent\n8",
    "of those efforts are unknown. The Complainant reported there may be delays in\ngetting said service due to therapeutic wait lists. The Complainant reported Foster\nParent A reported not wanting to be a therapist, but reported she is not getting\nguidance on what to do about the girls behaviors.\nOnsite agency visit\nOn 8/24/2022 I made an onsite visit to the Children’s Center agency. At that time, I\nmet with Administrator 2, Program Manager 3, and Quality Representatives 4 related\nto the complaint allegations. I also interviewed Supervisor 5, and Foster Care\nWorker (FCW) 6.\nSupervisor 5\nSupervisor 5 reported sometime after the children entered care with the agency on\n9/23/2021, the court ordered mental health services for the children. She advised\nthat the children live in Macomb County; and the agency has made various efforts to\nsecure the services. Various barriers occurred due to the children’s Medicaid,\nseveral providers not being available due a clinician shortage in Michigan, and\nthereby causing a shortage of slots for clinical services. Supervisor 5 reported in\nJuly 2022, the court order family therapy and the agency ran into a barrier with\ngetting this service squared away. Supervisor 5 reported this was due to the fact that\nthe children reside in Macomb, JAC (Juvenile Assessment Center) services are via\nWayne County and historically the child’s Medicaid has been tied to county of\nresidence. Meaning services must occur in that county of residence. She indicated\nthe agency initiated a JAC referral for said services on 7/21/2022; and as of recent\nthe JAC indicated they can provide some services. As of 8/16/2022 the JAC\nindicated they could not provide Infant Mental Health (IMH) services for Child C and\nChild D, but they can provide regular individual therapy. A separate referral for each\nchild was required. FCW 6 completed the referral on 8/23/2022 and Supervisor 5\nsaid she submitted it to the department on 8/24/2022.\nSupervisor 5 reported Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B were well aware of the of\nthe problems with therapy referrals, because it was explained to them throughout.\nAdditionally, the foster parents were also in attendance at the court hearings where\nthese issues and barriers were discussed.\nFoster Care Worker 6\nAs reported elsewhere in this report, FCW 6 is relatively new to Case X. She\naffirmed Supervisor 5’ reporting related to there not being many infant mental\nservices available. She also relayed that to Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B;\nand that the agency would keep the family informed of the progress on therapy\nefforts. FCW 6 reported being responsible for completion of updated JAC referral\nwhich she reported making today (8/24/2022).\nFoster Parent A\nFoster Parent A was interviewed by me via telephone on 9/12/222. She reported\nthey have asked about services for Child C and Child D for a long time. She\n9",
    "acknowledged the agency advised them of the referral process, lack of therapists,\nand wait list pertaining to therapeutic services. Foster Parent A reported they\nunderstand wait lists, but they still had concerns and questioned a continued delay\nwith these services since the children have been in care for over year. Foster Parent\nA reported “it is just taking a long time”. She reported the agency did try to assist\nthem with referrals, by suggesting they call this program or that one; but the agency\nwas not making those calls. She reported the agency has gotten Child C and Child\nD into family therapy with their birth mother. The agency thought that might help, but\nindividual service are still pending. Three week prior, the agency advised that Child\nC and Child D would get individual therapy through the same therapist they are\nseeing for family therapy.\nReviewed\nA review of Child C’s and Child D’s case records showed:\n• The agency completed a referral for psychological assessment and services for\nthe children via Imagine for Psychological Health Center on 10/27/2021.\nAdditionally, via that assessment that provider referred the foster parents to\nEaster Seals for other possible services\n• The agency also completed a referral for services, in November 2021, then again\non 7/21/2022 and lastly on 8/23/2022.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\n10",
    "ANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to support a lack of direct work\nwith the foster family and resource providers related to services\nfor the children. A lack of resources and therapist availability\nimpacted the agency’s ability to secure timely individual\ntherapeutic services for the children. Those barriers have now\nbeen worked though. The children are reported to be in line to\nreceive said service via the JAC, as an adjunct to the family\ntherapy.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe foster care worker is monitoring multiple visits at once and not appropriately\nsupervising.\nThe foster parent is being mandated to travel extensively for parenting visit.\nINVESTIGATION:\nComplainant\nI spoke with the complainant about this allegation via telephone on 8/22/2022. The\nComplainant reported it was reported that the FCW is conducting parent/child visits\nfor the birth mother via Zoom, while simultaneously supervising another parent/child\nvisit over Zoom.\nThe Complainant affirmed the allegation in the complaint statement. Further, that the\nfoster parent expressed a concern related to transporting Child C and Child D to\nparenting visits which are reportedly two hours away. That it is alleged the agency is\nnot willing to work with the foster parents; and the FCW told Foster Parent A the\ndepartment “does not care about how far away visits are”. Additionally, that the\nFCW told the foster parents it is their responsibility to transport to and from visits;\nand the agency has no regard for the foster parents’ schedule or how inconvenient it\nis for them.\nOnsite agency visit\nOn 8/24/2022 I made an onsite visit to the Children’s Center agency. At that time, I\nmet with administrative staff as listed prior about these allegations. I also interviewed\nSupervisor 5, and FCW 6.\nSupervisor 5 & FCW 6\nSupervisor 5 and FCW 6 denied the allegations.\nSupervisor 5 reported:\n• Visitation for the children’s birth mother occurs in the agency’s office, face to\nface not Zoom. That at times, a worker may be supervising another visit\nduring an office time, but in those instances, the worker is positioned in such\na way she is directly aside both rooms and can observe both. Additionally,\n11",
    "there are times visits occur by use of rooms with two-way mirrors. In those\ninstances, the worker is only supervising that visit, at that time. Supervisor 5\nwas not sure why someone would make this allegation; but reported an\nawareness of the foster parents not being happy that the court has ordered\nZoom or telephone visitation for Child C and Child D with their birth father.\nThe agency is aware Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B have a\ndemanding schedule and that’s why the agency has made accommodations\nwith and for them. Therefore, workers will go out on Saturday because that\nworks best for the foster parents.\n• Parenting visits for Child C and Child D, nor sibling visits are two hours way.\nNor has she or an agency staff told Foster Parent A and or Foster Parent B\nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) does not care about\nthe distant of visits. She/the agency explained to the foster parents about\ntravel/mileage and visitation time requirement by the department based on\nthe age of the children.\nWhen Case X was with DHHS, DHHS was transporting the children from\ntheir placements to the DHHS office for visits. When the case transferred to\nthe Children’s Center on 9/23/2021, the Children’s Center continued that\ntransportation support practice. The agency transported to a meeting/drop off\npoint (unless the person couldn’t do so, and then the Children’s Center would\ntransport the whole way). That in the earlier months of Child C’s and Child\nD’s placement, they were with Caregiver W, and Caregiver W utilized Foster\nParent A and Foster Parent B for transportation. Therefore, Foster Parent A\nand Foster Parent B have been aware of transportation responsibilities on\nthis case. Additionally, Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B have never\nrequested transportation assistant, nor complained about it to Supervisor 5.\nThe agency has provided the foster parents documents they can use to\nrequest mileage reimbursement related to transportation.\nFor now, with sibling visitation, both caregivers reside in Macomb County. As\nfor parenting visitation, the birth mother visits occur at the office; and to\nminimize transportation travels, the agency has scheduled sibling visits\nweekly on the same day as the birth mother’s visit. That it was just recently\nthat the court ordered Zoom or telephone visitation by the birth father, and\nFoster Parent A and Foster Parent B voiced upset on that. The foster parents\ndo not want the birth father to have their telephone number or for their home\nto be exposed. The agency is still exploring a way to facilitate the birth\nfather/children visits without the foster parent being comprised in any way.\nFCW 6 reported:\n• Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B were Child C’s and Child’s D’s\nsubstitute care provider from Caregiver W’s neighborhood. The foster\nparents seemed more abreast of some things about the girls than the\n12",
    "agency. Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B participated in the April 2022\nFTM placement change about the girls, where services and transportation\nneeds were discussed and shared with them. She explained to the foster\nparents that Child C and Child D have a right to Zoom visit with their birth\nfather, and Foster Parent B said he was not going to do that. FCW 6\nreported the agency was still working this out with the foster parents.\nHer supervision of parent/child visits have been with the birth mother and\nchildren. These visit have not been via Zoom but are in a visitation room. She\nmonitors these visits via a two-way mirror. Since her assignment on this\ncase, she has supervised four parent/child visits and there was never a time\nwhere she supervisor another visit at the same time. Additionally, the Zoom\nvisits with the children’s birth father are pending; efforts need to be work\nthrough.\n• Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B seemed to be under the impression\nthat Child C and Child D would become permanent wards, because the\nchildren initially entered foster care under an original permanent custody\npetition. The foster parents are very new; Child C and Child D are their first\nplacements; and the foster parents seem to have unrealistic expectations.\nWhen they make a request, they think it will be taken care of immediately;\nand do not fully understand or do not take into account processes, DHHS\npolicies and agency requirements. Such as them wanting the agency to\nmandate the birth mother to bring food to the parent/child visit. They want the\ngirls to get a full meal. They are concern about the girls getting cookies at the\nparenting time, because they have the girls on a sugar free diet.\nOtherwise, the foster parents have not complained about transportation or\nparent/ child visitation. The foster parent do take very good care of the\nchildren,\nFoster Parent A\nFoster Parent A was interviewed by me about this allegation via telephone on\n9/12/2022. Foster Parent A reported the concern was about the parent/ child visits being\ntwo hours, not two hours away. Foster Parent A reported when Supervisor 5 was the\nworker on the case, Supervisor 5 would always say the girls are to get parent/child\nvisitation based on their ages, which was a policy requirement. Supervisor 5 reported\nthe birth mother should have visit with the children four hours a week. When family\ntherapy was ordered (whereby the children and birth mother are visiting) and it was\nindicated the family therapy and individual therapy could not be on the same day, Foster\nParent A inquired how was all this going to work. Especially since Foster Parent A\nresides an hour away from the agency. Foster Parent reported asking the agency why\nthey can’t do all this on the same day, and that seemed to be problem. She said she\nand Caregiver R have worked things out, whereby they have added an hour to the\nsibling visits/the children are visiting two hours a week. She and Foster Parent B just\nwant to know how all this was going to work for a four-hour visit, since their round-trip\n13",
    "drive would be two hours. Because of that she told Supervisor 5, she and Foster Parent\nB were not doing it. That’s when Supervisor 5 said DHHS does not care how far the visit\nis. Foster Parent A said “I care”; and the matter was left like that. They were all\nawaiting the 10/20/2022 court hearing on all this.\nFoster Parent A reported one of the other things she reported a concern about was\nparent/child visit supervision. That during a visit, the children reported using swear\nwords during their parent/child visits. Foster Parent A asked if the FCW was in the\nroom; and were told the worker had left the room. Foster Parent A reported not having\ndirect evidence the worker was not supervising the visit; but Foster Parent reported\nthere have been extended times were the caseworker was just recording the visit, not\nconducting direct monitoring. Foster Parent A did not elaborate on how she knew this.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06I Maintaining connections: Parenting time, Sibling\nVisitations, and Contact\nObservation and Supervision:\nParenting time must be supervised or unsupervised as ordered\nby the court. Caseworkers may periodically observe\nunsupervised parenting time to assess family functioning and\nrelationships, parenting skills, and adherence the parenting time\nplan.\nIf the court grants MDHHS discretion to provide supervised or\nunsupervised parenting time, parenting time must be provided\nwith the lowest level of supervision needed to reasonably\nensure child safety.\nANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegation or that\nthe safety of the children were not ensured for during\nparent/child supervision.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the children,\ntheir families, and other relevant individuals and be\nprimarily responsible for the development, implementation,\nand review of service plans for the children and their\nfamilies.\n14",
    "ANALYSIS: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegations that the\nagency mandated extraneous transportation by the foster\nparents or would not work with the foster family related to the\nchildren’s service plan.\nThe agency tried to explain parent/child visitation mandates as\nrequired by DHHS and agency policy; and offered the foster\nparent mileage reimbursement.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan continuation of the agency\ncurrent licensing status is recommended.\n10/27/2022\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/27/22\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n15"
