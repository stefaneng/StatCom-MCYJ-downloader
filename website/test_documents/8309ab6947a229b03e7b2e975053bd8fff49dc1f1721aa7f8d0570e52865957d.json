    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4109 Program statement\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a current written program\nDescription statement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission, care,\nsafety, and supervision, methods for addressing residents' needs,\nimplementation of treatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Last night (6/30/25), a youth was sitting in their feces for two\nhours. It is believed that the staff responsible was aware, but was\nwaiting for shift change for another staff to change the youth. The\nyouth was given a tablet instead of being changed. The youth\nwas changed by the staff that took over.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nComplainant was interviewed via phone on 7/2/25.\nComplainant reported she did not have any additional information.\nYouth A is non-verbal and could not be interviewed.\nConsultant observed Youth A face to face at the facility on 7/2/25\nand no concerns were noted.\nDirector was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/2/25.\nDirector reported the incident occurred on 6/30/25 in the\nafternoon, at the beginning of 2nd shift. Director reported Youth A\nhad his tablet at the time of the incident, but according to Youth\nA’s treatment plan, he should not have had his tablet at that time.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 7/7/25. Staff 1 reported\nshe was assigned to Youth A as a 1:1 staff for approximately 1 ½\nhours before she left 1st shift (approximately 2:30pm). Staff 1\nreported Youth A requested tablet time, so she allowed him to.\nStaff 1 reported he was in his room during the duration she was\nassigned as his staff, and she completed 15 minute checks on him\nthroughout the entire time. Staff 1 reported he has a sheet with\npictures on it for “bathroom, tablet, etc.” and he uses that to\ncommunicate his needs. Staff 1 reported she has been working at\nthe facility for 3 months and doesn’t know Youth A extremely well\nbut knows him well enough. Staff 1 reported Youth A makes\ncertain movements when he has to use the bathroom, and he\nnever made those movements or showed her the picture to tell her\nhe needed to use the bathroom. Staff 1 reported Youth A is really\ngood at telling staff when he needs to use the bathroom, therefore\nshe didn’t have any concerns about him notifying her. Staff 1\nreported each time she checked on him in his room, she walked\n2",
    "fully into his room and asked if he was okay. Staff 1 reported each\ntime she went into Youth A’s room, he was on his tablet and\nresponded with a thumbs up sign saying he was okay. Staff 1\nreported he and his room did not smell like feces, and he never\nhad any feces on his body or anywhere else when she entered his\nroom. Staff 1 reported when she completed her checks, she\ndocumented them on the sheet in his binder and completed all\nnecessary paperwork for his behavior and bathroom needs during\nthe time she was assigned as his staff. Staff 1 reported she was\nshocked when she heard about the incident from Chief\nAdministrator because Youth A was fine when she did her checks.\nStaff 1 reported she could not remember who she handed Youth\nA’s binder to at the end of her shift, but he was the team lead for\n2nd shift on 6/30/25.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 7/2/25. Staff 2 reported he\narrived for 2nd shift on 6/30/25 around 2:00pm and he was\nscheduled to be the team leader for the shift. Staff 2 reported he\ncompleted paperwork for the first 15 minutes and then entered the\nmilieu around 2:15pm. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was assigned to\nYouth A on 1st shift and when Staff 2 went out to the milieu, Staff 1\nwas sitting on her phone. Staff 2 reported by 2:30pm, Staff 1 was\nleaving for the day, and she still hadn’t completed a room check\non Youth A because she was still on her phone. Staff 2 reported\nhe went to check on Youth A in his room at 2:30pm and found\nYouth A sitting in his own fecal matter. Staff 2 reported the fecal\nmatter was dried on, and Youth A had smeared it all over himself\n(arms, legs, chest, etc.). Staff 2 reported Youth A had his tablet,\nwhich is against Youth A’s protocol as he is not supposed to have\nit until 6:30pm. Staff 2 reported he took Youth A to the bathroom,\ncleaned him up and switched Youth A to his assigned 2nd shift\nstaff. Staff 2 reported he checked Youth A’s bathroom log, which\nshowed the last documented time he was taken to the bathroom\nwas 12:32pm. Staff 2 reported Youth A is supposed to be taken to\nthe bathroom every hour per his bathroom protocol. Staff 2\nreported he checked Youth A’s bed check logs and saw there was\nno documentation for any bed checks completed since Youth A\nwent to the bathroom at 12:32pm. Staff 2 reported he did not know\nhow long Youth A was sitting in his own feces, but it was long\nenough for it to be dried on, so he guessed it was at least 40\nminutes. Staff 2 reported there have been at least two other\ninstances of Staff 1 being talked to about being on her phone\nrather than paying attention to the youth. Staff 2 reported he\nwasn’t a part of those conversations but was aware of them\noccurring.\n3",
    "Staff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 7/2/25.\nStaff 3 reported he was the team leader on 1st shift on 6/30/25;\nhowever, he was not aware of the incident and was not told about\nthe incident.\nStaff 4 was interviewed via phone on 7/8/25. Staff 4 reported he\nwas not assigned to Youth A on 6/30/25 and didn’t see him or\nStaff 1 much that day. Staff 4 reported he was not aware of the\nincident and did not have any further information.\nStaff 5 was interviewed via phone on 7/7/25. Staff 5 reported\nduring shift change on 6/30/25, he was supposed to take over for\nYouth A for 2nd shift, but he was with a different youth. Staff 5\nreported Staff 2 was the team leader for 2nd shift and completed a\nbed check on Youth A. Staff 5 reported when Staff 2 completed\nthe check, Staff 2 found Youth A had soiled himself, and it looked\nlike he had been soiled for a long time. Staff 5 reported Staff 2\ntook Youth A to the bathroom to clean him up. Staff 5 reported he\ncould not remember the name of the staff assigned to Youth A for\n1st shift, but she was a newer female employee. Staff 5 reported\nhe did not know what the female employee was doing when she\nwas supposed to be checking on Youth A because he was\nfocused on the youth he was assigned to.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Mobile Devices and Personal Phone Use policy states it is\nnot possible to implement the agency’s mission, vision, and\nvalues unless staff are fully present, emotionally and\nphysically, while at work. Therefore, the use of electronic\ncommunications devices by employees while at work is\nallowed only with the express permission of a supervisor.\nPhone use while working can present safety risks to\nindividuals served and can cause distractions to\nemployees, which can cause harm. Safety concerns must\nalways be made a priority.\n• Youth A’s Toileting Protocol states Youth A should be\nprompted every hour to use the bathroom if he does not\nindependently. Youth A self-initiates by signing “bathroom”\nor using the “bathroom” icon.\n• Youth A’s toileting and data sheet dated 6/30/25 does not\nshow any toileting information after 12:32 pm.\n• Incident report dated 6/30/25, authored by Staff 2 states\nStaff 2 performed a 15 minute bed check on [Youth A] at\n2:35pm when it was found [Youth A] had an accident in his\npants which he had been digging in and smearing all over\nhis hands, arms, chest, and back. Staff 2 cleaned Youth A\n4",
    "up and left him in the care of the next staff for second shift.\nIt was reported to management. After reporting to\nmanagement, Staff 2 investigated the binder to find the last\ndocumented bathroom trip was at 12:32pm and there were\nno documented 15 minute checks by the previous staff.\nInformation was reported to management and Recipient\nRights.\n• Youth A’s Updated Service Plan dated 3/5/25 states [Youth\nA] may have access to his personal tablet after dinner, until\nbedtime.\n• Staff 1 has two disciplinary records in her employee file\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 1 does not have any\ndocumentation of discipline surrounding inappropriate\nphone use. Staff 1 was terminated from the facility on\n7/3/25 for reasons unrelated to this investigation. Staff 1\nwas trained on youth plans, youth protocols and facility\npolicies during orientation, shadow shifts, and IRT2 training\nin March and April 2025.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation as per interviews conducted and\ndocumentation reviewed, Staff 1 did not follow Youth A’s\ntreatment plan regarding tablet use, did not follow Youth A’s\ntoileting protocol, and did not follow the facility’s cell phone policy.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR#2025SIC0000010 dated 11/8/24; CAP approved 11/22/24\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127 Staff to resident ratio\nSection (4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nDescription supervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval checks\nshall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Staff did not complete observation checks while a youth was in\ntheir bedroom.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 7/7/25. Staff 1 reported\nshe was assigned to Youth A as a 1:1 staff for approximately 1 ½\nhours before she left her shift (approximately 2:30pm). Staff 1\nreported he was in his room during the duration she was assigned\nas his staff, and she completed 15 minute checks on him\nthroughout the entire time. Staff 1 reported when she completed\nher checks, she documented them on the sheet in his binder and\ncompleted all necessary paperwork for his behavior and bathroom\nneeds during the time she was assigned as his staff.\n5",
    "Staff 2 was interviewed via phone on 7/2/25. Staff 2 reported he\narrived for 2nd shift on 6/30/25 around 2:00pm and he was\nscheduled to be the team leader for the shift. Staff 2 reported he\ncompleted paperwork for the first 15 minutes and then entered the\nmilieu around 2:15pm. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was assigned to\nYouth A on 1st shift and when Staff 2 went out to the milieu, Staff 1\nwas sitting on her phone.

Staff 2 reported\nhe went to check on Youth A in his room at 2:30pm and found\nYouth A sitting in his own fecal matter. Staff 2 reported he\nchecked Youth A’s bed check logs and saw there was no\ndocumentation for any bed checks completed since Youth A went\nto the bathroom at 12:32pm.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED:\n• Incident report dated 6/30/25, authored by Staff 2 states\nStaff 2 performed a 15 minute bed check on [Youth A] at\n2:35pm. Staff 2 investigated the binder to find there were\nno documented 15 minute checks by the previous staff.\n• Supervision Practice Policy states supervision in which a\nstaff does not continuously monitor a resident’s well-being\nbut instead performs a visual check of the resident\n(minimally every 15 minutes).\n• Youth A’s data sheet dated 6/30/25 shows Staff 1 signed\noff on checks for Youth A between 1:15-1:30pm, 1:30-\n1:45pm, 1:45-2:00pm, 2:00-2:15pm, and 2:15-2:30pm.\nThere is no spot to write the exact time she completed each\nof the checks to know whether it was in line with the\nlicensing rule.\n• Staff 1 has two disciplinary records in her employee file\nunrelated to this investigation. Staff 1 does not have any\ndocumentation of discipline surrounding inappropriate\nphone use. Staff 1 was terminated from the facility on\n7/3/25 for reasons unrelated to this investigation. Staff 1\nwas trained on facility policies during orientation, shadow\nshifts, and IRT2 training in March and April 2025.\nAnalysis The facility is found in violation as per documentation reviewed, it\nis unclear when Staff 1 completed observation checks on Youth A,\nor whether those checks met the requirement of variable interval\nchecks not to exceed 15 minutes since 15-minute timeframes are\nprefilled on the youth data sheets. Based on Staff 2’s interview\nand the incident report completed; it seems clear checks were not\ncompleted as required since Youth A was sitting in his own feces\nlong enough for it to be dried on his skin.\n6",
    "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\n• The facility was provided technical assistance regarding\nYouth A’s Service Plan Monitoring Prompts as it stated,\n“During sleep hours, staff will visually check on [Youth A]\nevery 15 minutes”. Facility was notified they needed to\nensure all youths’ plans coincide with the requirements of\nthe rule, which includes variable interval checks not to\nexceed 15 minutes whenever a youth is in their bedroom\n(not just during sleeping hours).\n• The facility should also update their youth data sheets to be\nconsistent with the licensing rule. Currently, the times are\npre-filled with 15 minute intervals, which does not meet the\nrequirement of the licensing rule as it is unknown when the\nstaff completed the visual check since the staff do not fill\nout the time they completed the check. For example, a staff\ncould complete a check at 1 pm (between 1-1:15pm time\nslot) and not complete another check until 1:30pm\n(between 1:15-1:30pm timeslot). The staff would meet the\nrequirements currently listed on the data sheet, but do not\nmeet the licensing requirements. Data sheets should not\ninclude pre-filled out timeframes.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJuly 23, 2025\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 25, 2025\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n7"
