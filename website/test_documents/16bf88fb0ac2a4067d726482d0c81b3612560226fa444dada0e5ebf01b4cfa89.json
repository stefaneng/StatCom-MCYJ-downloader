The\nagency submitted an acceptable corrective action plan in response to the renewal\ninspection completed on 6/9/2022 with a corrective action plan approved on\n7/1/2022. During the review the agency had thirteen violations. Six citations were\nnoted as repeat violations in the current inspection. During this period under\nreview the agency noted that compliance was impacted, in part, by an ongoing\nvacancy in licensing.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe assessment reported the agency's efforts in meeting licensing requirements\nduring this review period. The Chief Administrator (CA) stated the agency has\nbeen short staff in licensing for almost a year, however the agency has worked\nhard to complete tasks timely and efficiently. The CA noted the agency has\nexperienced some challenges regarding an insufficient number of dental providers\nand an overall lack of medical and dental providers that accept Medicaid.\nThe CA indicated the agency has implemented additional internal methods to\nensure compliance. The development of an internal tracking spreadsheet for\nlicensing and worker/supervisor checklist have been beneficial. The CA also noted\nstaff have taken a more active role in assuring proper, complete case files. The\nCA expressed confidence that the agency will continue to see improvement over\nthe next review period.\nFinancial Overview\nNA\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff reported frustration\nwith managing difficult clients but recognized this is part of the job and not\nreflective of the agency. Staff reported supervisors and coworkers are supportive\nand willing to help out as needed. Staff reported no areas of concern.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services All files were stored securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\n7",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
