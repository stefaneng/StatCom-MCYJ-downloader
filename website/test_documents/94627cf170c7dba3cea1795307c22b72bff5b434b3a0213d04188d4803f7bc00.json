    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nStaff 1 threatened and intentionally caused harm to Resident A No\nAdditional Finding:\nDuring this incident staff were out of ratio Yes\nResident A alleged Staff 1 pushed a chair into her leg and threatened to beat her.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n03/06/2020 Special Investigation Intake\n2020C0108035\n03/06/2020 Special Investigation Initiated - Letter\nEmailed Rights Advisor notifying of complaint\n03/06/2020 Contact - Face to Face\nInterviewed resident\n03/06/2020 Contact - Telephone call received\nInterviewed Staff 1 by phone\n03/06/2020 Exit Conference\nWith Rights Advisor\nALLEGATION:\nResident A alleged Staff 1 pushed a chair into her leg and threatened to beat her.\nINVESTIGATION:\nResident A, age 16, is an abuse/neglect ward. She has been at Vista Maria for eight\nmonths. I interviewed Resident A with Rights Advisor 1 present. On 2/26/20, she said\nshe complained to her DHHS worker and also filed an internal grievance pertaining to\nthis allegation. Rights Advisor 1 said he looked into the matter and did not find any\nreliable evidence to support Resident A’s claim that Staff 1 intentionally hurt or\nthreatened her. Rights Advisor 1 said he and Resident A met on 2/27/20 to discuss a\nmutually agreed-upon plan. The plan is in effect and involves separating Resident A\nand Staff 1 for 21 – 30 days followed by a mediation meeting with both parties.\n2",
    "DCWL received this complaint on 3/6/20 after it had already been internally investigated\nand resolved.\nAsked about the allegation, Resident A said on 2/26/20, she and several other residents\nwere in the gym. Staff 1 intentionally pushed a rolling chair against her leg causing her\nto break a fingernail. Then Staff 1 threatened to “beat her ass” if she told anyone.\nI interviewed Staff 1 by phone. She has worked at the facility for six months. Staff 1\nrecalled that she and Staff 2 were in the gym supervising nine residents. “Resident A\nand two of her peers kept walking out of the gym without permission. I called the\nsupervisor. She told me to close the gym door. Resident A was sitting on a chair in\nfront of the gym door. I asked her to move so I could close the door. She said ‘no,’ but\nstood up. I moved the chair to the side. Resident A said I ran over her feet, but I did\nnot. I stood in front of the gym doors until the supervisor came.” Staff 1 denied ever\nthreatening to beat Resident A.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Staff qualifications.\n(1) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: There is no evidence that Staff 1 threatened Resident A or\nintentionally or unintentionally rolled or pushed a chair into her\nfoot or leg. Therefore there is nothing to indicate that Staff 1\ndoes not have the ability or experience to perform the duties of\nher assigned position.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDING:\nStaff 1 said she was assigned to monitor a one-to-one resident while she was in the\ngym with Staff 2 and eight other residents. That left Staff 2 in charge of eight residents.\nThe staff-to-resident ratio in this facility is 1:4. Staff 1 said the supervisor was working\nas a direct care worker that day on her wing, but had to leave to perform security\nchecks. While the supervisor was away, the staff were out of ratio.\n3",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(1) The licensee shall develop and adhere to a written staff-\nto-resident ratio formula for direct care workers.\nANALYSIS: The staff-to-resident ratio is 1:4. On 2/26/20, two staff were\nmonitoring nine residents in the gym. One of those residents\nwas on one-to-one status. A resident on one-to-one status and\nher assigned staff person are not to be counted in the ratio.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION:\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nMarch 7, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 9, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
