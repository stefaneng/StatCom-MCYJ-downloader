DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS\nA. Physical Description of Facility\nThis facility is located on 36th St. SE in Kentwood, Michigan; in the SE section of Kent\nCounty. It was formerly the Pathfinder Resources residential program for adult women.\nThe facility has been totally renovated. The State Office of Fire Safety and the County\nEnvironmental Sanitarian have approved the DART program facilities. The facility has\n14 bedrooms with attached bathrooms. The living area is large with many areas for\nadolescents to spread out. The kitchen and dining facilities are also large and well\nfurnished. The facility is in excellent repair, extensively renovated, and is very clean.\nThe outside recreation area of the facility is fenced, but is small and furnished with only\nbasic playground equipment.\nB. Program Description\nThe DART Program [Developmental Adolescent Residential Treatment Program] is a\ncomponent of Hope Network’s residential services. It is a new facet in the continuum of\nservices in that it is Hope Network’s first residential program for adolescents. DART is a\nco-ed, locked, long term treatment program that is designed to provide intensive\nbehavioral health treatment to adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. DART\ntargets their services to adolescents with neurolodevelopmental conditions, autism,\nmental retardation, fetal alcohol syndrome, severe learning disabilities, ADHD, genetic\nand metabolic disorders, and other complex disabilities. Members of these populations\n2",
    "who exhibit mental and behavioral conditions that prevent them from community living\nare appropriate candidates for residency.\nThe program design is for extensive assessment and treatment. Psychiatrists,\nPsychologists, Neurologists, Therapists, and Medical Doctors are on staff. They will\nprovide a comprehensive assessment of development, cognition, personality, mental\nhealth, relationship potential, and adaptive functioning. Kentwood Public Schools also\nprovides special education services that include a high ratio of teachers, aides, and\ndirect care staff.\nStaffing ratios are between 1:2 and 1:3, with some residents receiving 1:1 staffing.\nTherapist caseloads are projected to be between 5 and 8 residents, depending on\nseverity. Activities are individualized to the resident and off-campus resources will be\nutilized when necessary. An activity therapist will assess each resident’s potential and\ninterests.\nC. Rule/Statutory Violations\nThe facility is in compliance with all licensing rules.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nI recommend issuance of a provisional license to this child caring institution, private.\n________________________________________\nSteve Ragsdale Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n________________________________________\nDeborah Clark Date\nArea Manager\n3"
