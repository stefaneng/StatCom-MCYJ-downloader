    "II. ALLEGATION(S)\nViolation\nEstablished?\nWhile attending school at the facility, two youth requested to use Yes\nthe bathroom and engaged in sexual acts in the male bathroom. It\nis unknown who was supervising the youth at this time.\nAdditional Findings No\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n05/10/2022 Special Investigation Intake\n2022C0137026\n05/12/2022 Special Investigation Initiated - On Site\n05/12/2022 Contact – In Person Interview of Staff\n05/13/2022 Contact – Email Received\n05/19/2022 Contact – In Person Interview of Staff\n05/19/2022 Contact – In Person interview of Youth\n05/19/2022 Preliminary Findings Provided\nALLEGATION: While attending school at the facility, two youth requested\nto use the bathroom and engaged in sexual acts in the male bathroom.\nIt is unknown who was supervising the youth at this time.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 05/12/2022 the special investigation was initiated at the facility. A meeting was\nheld with the Chief Administrator. It was confirmed that the allegations are relevant\nto the non-secure program. The Chief Administrator advised that Staff A was on\nshift for this day. I was also informed that Youth B is currently COVID positive, and\nthat Youth A was also tested, but results were negative. I was also advised that\nwhile in school, females and males are in separate classrooms. The Chief\nAdministrator reported that it was his understanding that the youth asked to go to the\nrestroom at different times yet ended up in the male restroom together. A tour of the\nschool and the bathroom area was completed. A request was also made for a copy\nof the supervision policy and any incident reports associated with the incident.\nOn 05/13/2022 I received an email with copies of the supervision policy and hall\nmonitor policy for the school. Both polices were reviewed. The hall monitor policy\nspecifically indicated that hall monitor staff are expected to check the restroom after\neach use and that Youth Specialist must monitor the halls and classrooms from a\nstanding/walking position when assigned to hall monitor duty. The supervision\npolicy indicated that staff will maintain line of sight at all times and provide vigilant\nsupervision of the youth.\n2",
    "On 05/19/2022 Staff A was interviewed at Children’s Village. He advised that he is a\n17-year employee and has one incident of discipline in his employee file. Staff A\nadvised that policy identifies a time for boys to go to the restroom and for girls to go\nto the restroom. Boys are supposed to go during 2nd and 5th hour and girls are to go\nduring 1st and 6th hour. Staff A confirmed that this did not occur. Staff A also\nconfirmed that staff are required to unlock the restrooms for residents to enter. Staff\nA reported that Youth B first came out and requested to go to the restroom. He\nrecalls that he did ask her why she was out during this time (as it was not time for\nfemale residents). Youth B responded that she must go to the restroom, and he\nobserved a sanitary napkin in her hand, so he let her in. He then reported that\nmoments later Youth A came out of his classroom and requested entry to the\nrestroom, and he let him in. Staff A admitted that after both residents were in the\nrestroom, he returned to a bench at the entrance of the facility and sat down. Staff A\nindicated that he does not recall the youth coming out of the restroom and admitted\nthat he did not check the restrooms as required by policy.\nOn 05/19/2022 an interview of Youth A occurred at Children’s Village. Youth A was\ninitially unwilling to answer any questions regarding the incident. He indicated that\nthe police had been to talk with him, and he thought this was “all over”. I advised\nhim that I was attempting to determine if the agency had violated any of the licensing\nrules that are in place. Youth A confirmed that Staff A was on staff the date of the\nincident and that he let both him and Youth B into the restroom. Youth A then\nindicated that Staff A failed to continue to provide monitoring and returned to “the\nbench” to sit down. He stated that the normal staff person always continues to\nmonitor, but Staff A did not.\nOn 05/19/2022 an attempt was made to interview Youth B. I was unable to interview\nher as she had returned to quarantine status due to COVID exposure. Additional\nattempts to interview Youth B were not made as non-compliance with the licensing\nrules had been confirmed.\nOn 05/19/2022 preliminary findings of the investigation were provided to the Chief\nAdministrator.\nDocumentation reviewed for this investigation includes the following:\n• Children’s Village Supervision Policy\n• Children’s Village Hall Monitor Policy\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n3",
    "(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: At the conclusion of the investigation, there was sufficient\nevidence to support non-compliance by the agency with\nlicensing rule R 400.4109 (1) (c). Both Staff A and Youth A\nreported that line of sight supervision was not maintained.\nSpecifically Staff A admitted to returning to a bench area to sit\ndown and failing to monitor youth that were in the restroom.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\n______________________________________________06/30/2022___________\nCassandra Thomas Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 5, 2022\n__________________________________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
