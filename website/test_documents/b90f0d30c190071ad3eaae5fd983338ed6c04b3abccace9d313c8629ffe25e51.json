    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 8/8/23 at 10am, Supervisor allegedly punched Youth H in the\nchest after Youth H assaulted him. There were no immediate\nvisible injuries.\nInvestigation DCWL received this allegation reported by Complainant, also the\nfacility nurse, on 8/8/23, the same day the incident occurred.\nI notified Youth H’s foster care worker via email and collaborated\nwith Government Worker 1 via phone.\nI reviewed the facility’s history of licensing violations.\nOn 8/10/23, I arrived at the facility accompanied by Government\nWorker 1 and viewed video footage of the incident.\nVideo of Pod A dayroom\n9:24:39 – 09:24:46 - Youth H pulls the door down from locked\nmetal grievance box attempting to break it off. Supervisors 1, 2\nand Facility Manager approach him and Youth H runs away from\nthem toward the youth bedrooms.\n9:24:47 – 9:25:01 - Supervisor 1 moves with Youth H to the wall\nand attempts a single person Primary Restraint Technique (PRT)\nfor four seconds. Youth H slides down the wall to the floor.\nSupervisor 2, Facility Manager and Supervisor 1 pull the youth\nback to a standing position. Facility Manager opens a nearby\nbedroom door. Youth H is ushered into the room.\n09:25:02 – 09:27:24 - Supervisors 1, 2 and Facility Manager are\ninside the room or at the room entrance. The open door blocks\nthe view of the entrance to the room. Supervisor 2 leaves the\nroom and returns three times.\n2",
    "09:27:25 – 09:29:25 Facility Manager and Supervisor 2 are\nbringing tissue back and forth to the room.\n9:29:26 Youth H exits on his own and walks to his room.\nI asked Operations Manager (who showed us the video) why\ndestroying a grievance box warranted restraint. He said it’s parts\ncan cause serious harm to self and can be used as a weapon\nagainst others.\nAn incident report authored by Facility Manager at 9:26am on\n8/8/23 indicated the following:\n“While on Pod A, Youth H became upset over not being able to sit\nin seven chairs stacked on the pod. Supervisor 1 attempted to\nverbally de-escalate the situation but was unsuccessful. Youth H\nstarted punching the grievance box. Supervisors 1 and 2\nintervened; Youth H began to punch Supervisor 1 in the arm and\nface. He was escorted to his room and placed on a time-out; while\nbeing counseled inside of his room, Youth H continued to punch,\nstab with a toothbrush and bite Supervisor 1. He calmed down\nafter five minutes and regained self-control. Youth H was then\ncounseled by Facility Manager on his behaviors. Youth H was by\nthe facility nurse.”\nI interviewed Youth H jointly with Government Worker 1 on\n8/10/23. I observed his chest area and there were no visible\nmarks or bruises. Youth H said he tore the door off the grievance\nbox on 8/8/23 and Supervisor 1 physically restrained him against\nthe wall. Staff moved him into a bedroom, Youth H grabbed a\ntoothbrush, and stabbed Supervisor in his leg. “Supervisor 1\npunched me once in the chest and held me by my head and chest\non someone’s bed. Supervisor 2 and Facility Manager were there\nlooking right at us. I couldn’t breathe in or out.” Supervisor 2 and\nFacility Manager had him seen by the nurse. “They moved\nSupervisor 1 to Calumet.”\nAfter the incident, Youth H was assessed by the facility nurse and\nrequired no medical treatment. A chest x-ray of Youth H was\nrequested by Government Worker 1 and completed on 8/10/23\nshowing no abnormalities.\nI interviewed Facility Manager jointly with Government Worker 1.\nHe has worked at the facility for 15 years. Facility Manager said\nhe saw Youth H punching the metal grievance box and tried to\nverbally de-escalate him. “Youth H tried to tear the box off the\n3",
    "wall. Supervisor 1 and 2 intervened to prevent self-harm. Youth\nH ran and they ran after him. They wanted to place him in a PRT.\nYouth H resisted and punched and bit Supervisor 1. Youth H\ndropped to the ground. They lifted him and got him into room 7.”\nInside the room, “Youth H kept punching Supervisor 1 and tried to\nstab him. Supervisor 1 was standing over him trying to stop blows\nand talking to him. After five minutes Youth H stopped. His nose\nbled from working himself up. We got paper towel for his nose.…I\nwas there the whole time. I didn’t see Supervisor 1 punch him.”\nInside of the room, Facility Manager said Youth H was on his\nknees on the bed facing Supervisor 1. He said Youth H was not\nlying on the bed and Supervisor 1 did not hold him down on the\nbed. Overall Facility Manager felt the situation had a “good\noutcome” because seclusion was avoided.\nI interviewed Supervisor 2 jointly with Government Worker 1. He\nhas worked at the facility for six years. When Supervisor 2 arrived\nat the pod, he said Youth H was irritated. “He was destroying the\ngrievance box…We know youths can harm themselves with that.\nI’ve seen people get hit with a grievance box. It’s dangerous.”\nWhen Supervisor 1 attempted to stop Youth H, he said Youth H\npunched and tried to bite Supervisor 1. “We tried to hold Youth H.\nHe was still trying to hit Supervisor 1.”\nFrom the doorway to the room, Supervisor 2 said he saw Youth H\nstand on the bed and slide down the wall. “Supervisor 1 became\nthe ‘target’ and probably should have left. Supervisor 1 stood by\nthe bed and held Youth H’s arms to stop him from punching.”\nAfterward, “Youth H mentioned he got punched, but I did not see\nSupervisor 1 punch him…I did not see any toothbrush.”\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 jointly with Government Worker 1. He\nhas worked at the facility for 10 years and is a Handle with Care\nTrainer. Supervisor 1 has no disciplinary write-ups in his\npersonnel file.\nSupervisor 1 said he was on the pod “doing rounds” when he saw\nYouth H rocking on a stack of 7-8 chairs. “I tried to redirect\nverbally. I have a rapport with Youth H.” Youth H got off the\nchairs and Supervisor 1 removed them. “Youth H started kicking\nwalls. I left and called Facility Manager. He and Supervisor 2\ncame. Youth H hit the grievance box, walked away, returned, and\ntried to tear it off the wall. He went toward the wall. I told Facility\nManager to open a room. We went in and I tried to get him calm.\n4",
    "He was throwing punches and I’m blocking.” Supervisor 1 denied\nhitting Youth H in his chest or holding him down on the bed.\nI asked Supervisor 1 why he stayed inside the room with Youth H\nrather than exit the room. He said Youth H was hitting him but not\nhurting him. Supervisor 1 felt confident he could de-escalate the\nyouth and said he finds private spaces where youths can “be\nthemselves” away from others more conducive to 1:1 counseling.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis To protect Youth H and others from physical injury in response to\nYouth H tearing or attempting to tear a metal grievance box off the\nwall, Supervisor 1 attempted a single-person Primary Restraint\n(wall) Technique but was unsuccessful. The incident report, video\nfootage, staff interviews and medical reports do not support the\nallegation that Supervisor 1 hit or punched Youth H.\nCONSULTATION\nThe facility has experienced issues as a result of youths tearing\nmetal grievance boxes off the wall and cutting themselves and/or\nusing the grievance box or door as a weapon. I advised the\nfacility to consider implementing a safer method for youths to\nsubmit written grievances.\nAs Supervisor 2 noted, Supervisor 1 became Youth H’s target.\nThe best defense against blows from a youth is to remove oneself\nfrom the area if possible or switch out with a different staff.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nAugust 31, 2023\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\n5",
