Staff 2 said he had been off work for about two weeks\nand upon his return sat his group of youth down for a “circle” to\ntouch base on how each of them were doing since he last worked\nwith them. Staff 2 said when it was Youth D’s turn, she made the\ncomment about starting to trust staff now that certain staff are\ngone. Staff 2 said he asked Youth D what she meant by that\ncomment, and she said Youth A told her that Staff 1 used to grab\nher butt whenever she did not make her points to earn her missing\npoints. Staff 2 said he then asked Youth A about Youth D’s\nstatement and Youth A said anytime she did not make her points\nStaff 1 would make the statement “let me grab your ass and I will\nmake sure you get your privs”. Staff 2 said he asked Youth A dates\nthis occurred, and she said she could not remember. Staff 2 said\nthis was the first he had heard about this and immediately\nreported it to the supervisor on duty, group leader on call, and\nDHHS. Staff 2 said he had worked with Staff 1 when he was\nemployed at Bay Pines Center. Staff 2 said Staff 1 was not a good\nstaff as he would not always follow the schedule, would make\ncomments to the youth that were not appropriate such as if a\nyouth said she was going to kill herself, Staff 1 would say “do it\nthen” and walk away. Staff 2 said while Staff 1 would make\ninappropriate and uncaring comments to the youth, he never\nsuspected or had any indication of Staff 1 touching any of the\nyouth. Staff 2 said that while Staff 1 was employed, Bay Pines\nCenter was on a point system and each night after the youth were\nin their rooms for bedtime the staff would usually call them out\nindividually and review points with them.\nDocuments Reviewed\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record in\nthe file. Staff 1 was employed at Bay Pines Center from\nAugust 23, 2021, until June 9, 2022.\nAnalysis There is limited evidence that Staff 1 ever touched Youth A’s\nbuttocks; however after interviews with youth and staff, Staff 1\nwas found to lack the ability to appropriately preform the job duties\nof a youth specialist as there are multiple accounts of him sleeping\non the job, encouraging youth to fight one another, making\n4",
    "inappropriate statements to the youth to preform self-harm, and\nnot providing the required supervision while on duty, therefore the\nfacility is found in noncompliance with staff qualifications.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR2021C0128043 dated 10/5/21, CAP approval dated 10/28/21.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.
