    "concerns or caught youth having sexual intercourse when completing\nroom checks. He reported he writes down on the observation log\nevery time he does a room check.

He reported every time he does a room check he needs to\nnote within the observation log that it was completed. Staff 5 reported\nright now the process is to document it in the computer but when the\nsystem is down staff need to document it on paper. He reported the\nyouth do not like the room checks and sometimes get frustrated, but\nStaff 5 stated it needs to be done for their safety.

The video shows the staff completing a room check\nat 3:18am, 3:31am, 3:59am, 4:31am, and 4:42am.\n- Video was reviewed from 01/01/2024 with the time stamp of\n1am- 2am. The video started with the staff member sitting at\nthe computer in the staff only area that has a view of the\nyouth’s bedrooms. The staff member completed one room\ncheck during this video review at 1:23am.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n-Email from Law Enforcement dated 01/08/2024- Law\nEnforcement reported this case was not going to be assigned for\ncriminal investigation.\n- Email from Supervisor 2 dated 01/11/2024- Supervisor 2 reported\nthere is no formal policy in regard to the door needing to be open if a\nyouth is visiting in another youth’s room. She reported this is just\n5",
    "trained at the facility. Supervisor 2 reported there are no incident\nreports involving Youth A or Youth B regarding any sexual concerns\nand there were no concerns noted from their clinicians.\n-Facility Policy: Staff to Resident Ratio- This policy states, “When\nresidents are asleep or otherwise outside of direct supervision of\nstaff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on checks of residents.\nThe time between the variable interval checks shall not exceed 15\nminutes. The visual checks must be electronically recorded on the\nunit computer. If the electronic entry is not possible due to computer\nmalfunction or other circumstances, monitoring shall be done by\npaper documentation.”\n- Bed Check Observation Logs- Consultant reviewed bed check\nlogs from 12/16/23, 12/22/23, 12/27/23-1/2/24, and 1/4/24-1/12/24.\nMany bed check logs are missing time frames and are exceeding\nover the 15-minute bedroom check. For example, on 01/01/24 there\nwas only one bedroom check documented for 10:22pm. On the\nobservation log for 12/28/23 from 3am-5am the following bed checks\nwere noted at 3:10am, 3:31am, 3:32 am, 3:46 am, 3:59am, 4:18am,\n4:31am, 4:42am, and 4:51am. Note this is not consistent with video\nreview during this time frame.\n- Staff 3 HR File- Staff 3 did not have any disciplinary actions noted\nwith his employee file. Staff 3 has completed Orientation and\nShadow shifts to learn the responsibilities of his role and policies\nassociated with his role.\n- Staff 4 HR File- Staff 4 did not have any disciplinary actions noted\nwith his employee file. Staff 4 has completed Orientation and\nShadow shifts to learn the responsibilities of his role and policies\nassociated with his role.\n- Staff 5 HR File- Staff 5 did not have any disciplinary actions noted\nwith his employee file. Staff 5 has completed Orientation and\nShadow shifts to learn the responsibilities of his role and policies\nassociated with his role.\nAnalysis There is a violation found due to staff not completing room checks\nin variable intervals not to exceed fifteen minutes. This was found\nfrom interviews, video review and observation logs. During staff\ninterviews, some staff indicated they check on youth every 15\nminutes without varying intervals. Video shows many completed\nchecks exceeded 15 minutes.\nConsultation:\n- It is recommended the description on the observation log to\nbe updated. The form can be confusing as it notes “On\nschool days visual checks begin at 9pm and continue until\n6",
    "7am the following morning. On non-school days\nobservation will continue until 9am.” The staff should be\ncompleting visual checks on the youth when they are\nasleep or otherwise outside of direct supervision of staff,\nstaff shall perform variable interval, eye-on checks of the\nyouth. The time between the variable interval checks shall\nnot exceed 15 minutes.\nTechnical Assistance:\n- It is recommended the facility create a protocol for\nrequirements of supervision if a youth is hanging out in\nanother youth’s room such as if the door should be open,\nwhat time of day is this allowed, and what level of supervision\nis required.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & ACT 116 - 722.120 Investigation, inspection, and examination of\nSection conditions, books, records, and reports; access by department,\nDescription bureau of fire services, or local authorities; records; reports\nreport; forms; confidentiality; disclosure of information;\navailability of confidential records; child information cards to be\nprovided to department; failure of licensee to cooperation with\ninvestigation, inspection or examination.\n(1) The department may investigate, inspect, and examine conditions\nof a childcare organization and may investigate and examine the\nbooks and records of the licensee. The licensee shall cooperate with\nthe department’s investigation, inspection, and examination by doing\nall of the following:\n(c) Providing accurate and truthful information to the department, and\nencouraging witnesses, such as staff and household members, to\nprovide accurate and truthful information to the department.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Third shift staff are falsifying interval checks on observation logs.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on January 18, 2024. Staff 3\nreported he has been working third shift at the facility for about two\nmonths now. He reported that he completes room checks every\nfifteen minutes and will document it on the computer system. Staff 3\nstated the computer system is not always working correctly and\nsometimes it is down. He was asked if the system is down does he\ndocument the checks elsewhere, and he indicated he does not.\nStaff 4 and Staff 5 were interviewed separately via phone on\nJanuary 19, 2024. Both Staff 4 and Staff 5 reported on third shift all\nroom checks need to be documented when completed on the\nobservation log. They both reported if the computer system is down\n7",
    "then the room checks need to be documented on paper and given to\nSupervisor 2.\nVideo Footage reviewed:\nThe following video footage was randomly reviewed to check the\ncompliance of bedroom checks being completed on night shift due to\nthe allegations noting sexual acts were occurring in Youth A’s room.\n- Video was reviewed from 12/28/2023 with the time stamp of\n3am-5am. The video shows the staff completing a room check\nat 3:18am, 3:31am, 3:59am, 4:31am, and 4:42am. The staff\nthat were working on 12/28/2023 was Staff 5 and Staff 4.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n- Bed Check Observation Log for 12/28/23 from 3am-5am-\nForm notes bedroom checks were completed at 3:10am,\n3:31am, 3:32 am, 3:46 am, 3:59am, 4:18am, 4:31am, 4:42am,\nand 4:51am. Staff 5 was documented to be the one\ncompleting the form.\nAnalysis Based on video footage and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is established. The third shift staff falsified documentation\nthat they completed interval checks on youth, but video footage\nshows they did not complete checks as documented.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\nJanuary 24, 2024\n_____________________________________________\nCathrine Raftery Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 29, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8",
