    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 2/3/23, youth was arguing with another youth at the facility.\nYouth locked themselves in their room to calm down while staff\nstayed outside the door to monitor. Staff were laughing and\ncriticizing youth outside of the door. Staff blocked the door to\nprevent youth from leaving. Youth was later transported for a\nmental health evaluation.\nInvestigation This complaint was transferred to DCWL and assigned on\n02/15/2023.\nI interviewed the complainant via phone on 02/16/2023. The\nallegations were reviewed, and the complainant said they reported\nallegations after reviewing Youth A’s mental health records.\nI interviewed Youth A’s Foster Care Specialist via phone on\n02/17/2023. Youth A has been at the facility for 3 months and has\nbeen struggling due to her behavior and does not like to be told\nwhat to do. She denied having any concerns regarding staff or the\nfacility.

Youth A said\non the day in question she was upset about having to do chores\nand got into an argument with another youth. She wanted to be\nalone, so she locked herself in conference room, but the staff\nunlocked the door and would not leave her alone in the\nconference room. She denied staff was blocking the door, but said\nshe wanted staff to leave her alone in the conference room. She\nadmitted that she was have suicidal thoughts.

The\nDirector reported on the day in question Youth A was upset and\nlocked herself in the conference room, so the Supervisor unlocked\nthe conference door. Youth A refused to leave the conference\nroom, so the supervisor pulled up a chair and sat in the doorway\nto the conference, because Youth A kept locking the conference\nroom door.
