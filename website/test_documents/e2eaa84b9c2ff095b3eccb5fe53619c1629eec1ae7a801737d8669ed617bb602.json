    "Rule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 6/7/24 staff pushed, pulled, cornered, sandwiched, hip-\nchecked and body blocked Youth T multiple times potentially\ncausing multiple bruises on her arms.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI notified Complainant of this investigation assignment. She said\nshe did not witness the incident on 6/7/24.\nI notified Youth T’s JJ Worker of the investigation, and she\nexpressed no additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth T jointly with Government Worker on 6/10/24.\nShe has been at the facility for six months and is on probation.\nYouth T said she had an “issue” with Supervisor the day before\nthe incident. On 6/7/24 she was displaying behaviors in the living\narea that prompted staff to clear her peers from the space. “I was\nyelling and kicking the exit door. Staff 1 and Staff 2 restrained me.\nSupervisor came and switched with Staff 1. I understand how\nrestraints go. Supervisor grabbed me wrong and pinched my arm,\nso I basically hit her…I don’t know where. Maybe in the chest.\nSupervisor switched out with Team Leader.” Team Leader\nmentioned they were in the camera’s blind spot which implied to\nYouth T that “she could do whatever she wanted” to her. At that\npoint she said Team Leader pinched her right bicep causing at\nleast one bruise. Youth T heard someone say they were pressing\ncharges against her for assaulting staff. Then the police arrived\nbut did not question her. She is worried about getting new\ncharges and wants to stay at Vista Maria and not go to detention.\nYouth T said she had bruises on her arms immediately after the\nincident but refused to allow staff to check her arms. Afterward\nshe was transported to Garden City Hospital for a psychiatric\nevaluation and ineligible for inpatient hospitalization. At the\n2",
    "hospital, she showed hospital personnel the bruises on her arms\nand said they did not provide any treatment. Today on 6/10/24,\nshe said Vista Maria’s Nurse saw the bruises on her arms, took\nphotos and offered her ice.\nGovernment Worker and I observed and photographed\napproximately eleven green and brown bruises on Youth T’s inner\nand outer right bicep, inner and outer right forearm, inner left bicep\nand inner left forearm.\nOn 6/13/24 I interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker\nwith Rights Officer present. She has worked at the facility for over\na year and was last trained in CPI in March 2024. She was\nunable to present an understandable sequence of events\nregarding the incident. From what I could surmise, Staff 2 said\nshe and Staff 1 were in the living area when Youth T threw two\nchairs and banged on an exit door until the screws fell out. Staff\n1, Staff 2 and Team Leader physically prevented Youth T from\nbreaking handles off several doors. Supervisor arrived and Youth\nT hit Supervisor in her face. Supervisor and Staff 2 took Youth T’s\narms and held them by her side, then Team Leader and Staff 1\nswitched out and relieved them. Youth T struggled, then stopped\nbriefly and was released. Staff 1 and Staff 2 verbally tried to de-\nescalate her while standing in front of a door to prevent Youth T\nfrom kicking it. Youth T swung at Team Leader and hit Staff 2 in\nher chest. Staff 2 left the area. Youth T spit on Team Leader and\nTeam Leader left the area. Staff 2 was called back to assist\nagain. Staff 2 denied she mishandled Youth T and denied seeing\nany other staff mishandle her.\nOn 6/18/24 I interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker\nand Rights Officer present. She has worked at the facility over a\nyear and was last trained in CPI in November 2023. Staff 1 said\nYouth T has a history of kicking doors and breaking door handles\nat Vista Maria. She recalled that for an hour on 6/7/24, Youth T\npaced, hit Supervisor, would not respond to verbal redirection and\nmoved from door handle to door handle trying to break them.\n“From our training, when youths try to destroy property, we are\nsupposed to go into a hold. Me and Staff 2 pushed Youth T away\n(from doors and door handles) …We were trained to get her away\nfrom that area or hold her…Me and Team Leader were\nsandwiching her.”\nOn 6/18/24 I interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government\nWorker and Rights Officer present. She is the afternoon\nSupervisor at the facility and has over 25 years of experience\n3",
    "working with youths in residential facilities. Supervisor was last\ntrained in CPI in January 2024.\nGovernment Worker read the allegation aloud. Supervisor shed\ntears several times as she recalled Youth T’s behaviors on 6/7/24.\nShe stated Youth T was upset for unknown reasons and reached\nup to tear the hinge cover off a door. “I blocked it, and Youth T\npunched me three times in the chest. I grabbed her wrist and\nplaced her in a two-person hold with Staff 1 because she was\ndangerous to others. Youth T struggled and got out of the hold.\nStaff 2 came and switched out with me. I called 911…because\nYouth T was escalated, assaulted Team Leader and I, and\nneeded an inpatient psych evaluation. Youth T hit door handles\nand Team Leader and Staff 1 put her in another two-person hold.\nYouth T struggled and dropped to her knees, so they let go.”\nWhen police arrived, Supervisor said she and Team Leader\ninformed them they wanted to press charges against Youth T for\nassaulting them, but she does not believe the youth was charged.\nShe was frustrated that neither the mental health system nor the\nlegal system could be relied upon to intervene.\nSupervisor denied hearing Team Leader say anything about being\nin a blind spot. She said the physical restraint moves she\nperformed and witnessed others perform were in line with the\nagency’s behavior management protocol. When the incident\nlasting nearly an hour ended, Supervisor said Youth T refused\ndebriefing and a body check. Although she did not see any\nbruises on Youth T, she said bruising would be possible due to the\nhand placement of staff and pressure that must be applied when a\nyouth struggles against a hold. “If the hold is loose, they (youths)\npull out,” she explained.\nSupervisor added that previously Youth T caused so much\ndamage to the facility that it had to be closed for six weeks for\nrepairs and it just reopened the day before this incident. Rights\nOfficer confirmed that new walls were built, and existing ones\nwere reinforced totaling 100K and that Youth T had caused most\nof the damage.\nI reminded Supervisor the licensing rule effective May 2022\nindicates physical restraint is to only be utilized as a lifesaving\nresponse and that property damage no longer constitutes\njustification for physical intervention/restraint. Supervisor said she\nbelieves the door handles in the facility are “too easy to break.”\nFurther she indicated unidentified superiors told her that property\n4",
    "damage should be prevented as it can cause harm to the\nresident(s) and preventing it implies restricting the youth’s\nfreedom of movement if necessary.\nOn 6/18/24 I interviewed Team Leader jointly with Government\nWorker and Rights Officer present. She has worked for the\nagency for 21 years and was last trained in CPI in March 2024.\nGovernment Worker read the allegation aloud. Team Leader\nsummarized that on 6/7/24, Youth T was kicking doors, trying to\nbreak door handles and attacking staff with a closed fist. “She hit\nme and Supervisor… in my head and she also spat on me.”\nTeam Leader said she stepped between Youth T and a door and\nYouth T hit her. She and Staff 1 restrained Youth T with Team\nLeader on her right side and Staff 1 on her left. Youth T dropped\nher weight and was released. “We never got her into a full hold.\nShe struggled, wiggled and broke out. Then she kicked other\ndoors and tried to break the kitchen door handle…Youth T was\nnot injured.” I asked Team Leader if she and Staff 1 restrained\nYouth T to prevent her from destroying property. She stated, “We\nwere told we are supposed to stop youths from hitting walls\nbecause they can severely injure themselves and we are\nsupposed to block them from destroying property.” Team Leader\nsaid she left the area after Youth T spat in her face and on her\nback. “Since they remodeled the building after Youth T caused\n100K worth of damage, they put wood behind the walls. Unit\nManager said if kids are hitting or kicking (doors/walls), it’s\nautomatic physical management because they can hurt\nthemselves.” Team Leader denied saying anything to Youth T\nabout a blind spot on the unit adding “I just moved here from\nanother building. I don’t even know where the blind spots are.”\nI interviewed Nurse jointly with Government Worker and Rights\nOfficer present. On 6/10/24, she said Youth T showed her bruises\non her arms and told her they were caused by a restraint over the\nweekend. Nurse offered ice packs and pain medication to the\nyouth, but Youth T refused them.\nRights Officer added that Youth T was restrained on 6/6/24 the\nday before this incident after hitting staff, throwing chairs, flipping\ntables, kicking and hitting walls with no injuries documented or\nreported. He said no body chart was completed on 6/6/24\nbecause the youth was immediately transported to the hospital for\na psychiatric evaluation, found ineligible for inpatient treatment\nand returned to Vista Maria.\n5",

Youth T pulled on\na door handle and went door-to-door kicking. Team Leader\nentered the wing to assist. Youth T shook on the door handles\ntrying to break them. Team Leader escorted her away and she\ncontinued kicking doors. Youth T headed for the crossover door\nand shook the door handle. Team Leader again blocked her from\nshaking it. Supervisor relieved Team Leader by standing in front\nof the door to prevent Youth T from kicking it. Youth T hit\nSupervisor with a closed fist three times. Supervisor and Team\nLeader attempted CPI (Crisis Prevention Institute) team control\ntechnique and were unsuccessful due to Youth T continuing to try\nto assault Supervisor. Supervisor switched out with Team Leader\nagain. Supervisor contacted police at 6:18pm. Youth T\naggressively punched Team Leader in the head at approximately\n6:36 pm. Youth T was placed in a team control hold with Team\nLeader on the right and Staff 2 on the left.

Youth T\ntried to aggressively move Team Leader out of the way. Youth T\nspat in Team Leader’s face. Staff 1 switched out with Team\nLeader. Youth T spit on the back of Team Leader’s shirt. Youth T\ncontinued to be aggressive towards staff. Staff 1 and Staff 2\nplaced Youth T in a low hold, the youth dropped to the floor, and\nthey disengaged. Youth T began to calm down.\nA body chart completed by Staff 1 on 6/7/24 identified two bruises\non each of Youth T’s inner wrists.\nA body chart completed by Staff 4 on 6/9/24 identified 18 bruises\non the front and back of both of Youth T arms in addition to the\ntwo on her inner wrists identified by Staff 1 on 6/7/24.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance with this rule as pushing,\nshoving, hip-checking, cornering, sandwiching, body blocking and\nbending over a couch or bending a youth over and pushing on\nthem to hold them down Is prohibited. Staff 1, Staff 2 and Team\n11",
    "Leader engaged in these behaviors throughout the course of\nalmost a full hour.\nCONSULTATION\nOn 6/19/24 I recommended in an email to Chief Administrator that\nVista Maria remove all hand lever door locks which are easily\nbroken and offer low security and replace them with cylinder locks\nwhich are more resilient and offer increased security.\nConclusion Repeat Violations Established\n2024C0001126SI intake 2/07/24; CAP approved 3/12/24.\n2024SIC0001184 intake 2/23/24; CAP approved 3/25/24.\n2024C0001153SI intake 2/15/24; CAP approved 4/22/24.\n2024SIC0001304 intake 4/3/24; CAP pending.\nRule Code Emergency restraint\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4160\nSection (1) The use of emergency restraint as a lifesaving response for a\nDescription youth will be limited to:\n(a) An emergency response to protect the youth or others from\nan unanticipated or severely aggressive behavior that places the\nyouth or others at serious threat of violence or injury if no\nimmediate intervention occurs.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth T was physically managed to prevent property damage\nrather than as an emergency or life-saving response.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nStaff 2 described how Staff1, Team Leader and herself physically\nintervened to prevent Youth T from breaking handles off several\ndoors.\nStaff 1 stated “From our training, when youths try to destroy\nproperty, we are supposed to go into a hold. Me and Staff 2\npushed Youth T away (from doors and door handles) …We were\ntrained to get her away from that area or hold her.”\nSupervisor said Youth T hit door handles and Team Leader and\nStaff 1 put her in a two-person hold. She said her superiors told\n12",
    "her that property damage should be prevented because it can\ncause harm to resident(s) and that prevention implies physically\nrestricting the youth’s movement when necessary.\nTeam Leader explained “We (staff) were told we are supposed to\nstop youths from hitting walls because they can severely injure\nthemselves and we are supposed to block them from destroying\nproperty…Unit Manager said if kids are hitting or kicking\n(doors/walls), it’s an automatic physical management because\nthey could hurt themselves.”\nI interviewed Unit Manager jointly via video conference on\n6/26/24 with Government Worker and Rights Officer present. He\nhas been a CPI trainer at Vista Maria for 18 months. He said he\nbegan supervising Team Leader and Supervisor on 6/16/24, but\nhe was not their supervisor when this incident took place.\nUnit Manager listed four situations in which staff may and should\ninitiate physical restraint. 1) When a youth is in the process of\nassaulting a peer; 2) When the youth is in the process of\nassaulting staff; 3) When a youth is in the process of harming\nthemselves and 4) To remove an item in the youth’s possession\nthat can be used as a weapon.\nI asked Unit Manager how staff are taught to intervene when a\nyouth is attempting to destroy property or is in the process of\ndestroying it. He differentiated between two types of scenarios\ninvolving property destruction where timely and nuanced decisions\nmust be made on the part of staff. For example, when a youth is\nkicking property or attempting to break/tear a lock or door handle\noff (but has not yet torn it off), he said staff may only verbally\nintervene. However, when a youth is in the process of injuring\nherself by punching glass or another hard surface or possesses a\nhard object such as glass or metal that could be used as a\nweapon, staff should then intervene physically and remove the\nobject to stop her from injuring herself or others.\nVideo from 6/7/24 was reviewed and the details of the incidents\nobserved on video are noted above. It shows that there was no life\nthreatening situation that occurred that resulted in Staff 1, Staff 2,\nand Team Leader physically engaging with Youth T, or for\nSupervisor to not intervene and stop staff’s actions when they\nwere observed to be physically engaging with no imminent risk of\nharm.\nThe facility’s Prohibited Behavior Intervention Practices states:\n13",
    "They strictly prohibit excessive or inappropriate use of behavior\nmanagement intervention. Behavior management interventions\nwill not be used as a form of discipline or to force compliance, for\nthe convenience of staff, or for property damage that does not\ninvolve threatening danger to self or others.\nAnalysis Video showed Youth T approaching locked doors and hand levers\nand kicking backward on doors with the flats of her feet. Youth T\ndid not present an imminent danger to herself or others at these\ntimes. Youth T only became assaultive to staff after Staff 2 pulled\nher out of a chair and onto the floor, pushed her away using her\nhips, grabbed her arms and followed her around a relatively small,\nsecure room; which occurred repeatedly and over an extended\nperiod of time. Additionally, staff followed Youth T around the\nroom for an hour, which was inappropriate and did not serve to\nsettle Youth T down. Had Staff 2 not pulled her from the chair and\nother staff kept their distance, Youth T may not have hit at staff.\nYouth T’s hits and push towards staff were in response to staff\nbeing repeatedly inappropriately physical with her.\nOne staff stated they must physically “block” youths to stop them\nfrom damaging property. Two others said they believed they were\nallowed to use physical intervention to prevent property damage.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nYouth T was already in a secure confined space, so it was futile\nfor staff to hold or attempt to hold her only to release her back into\nthe same space before her behaviors de-escalated. Holding a\nyouth for the sole purpose of keeping her away from secure\nobjects such as doors and handles is neither permitted, nor\nsustainable. Pushing, hip-checking, cornering, sandwiching and\nbody blocking a youth is prohibited in all situations. However, in\nthis case, staff restricted Youth T’s movements not to protect her\nor themselves, but to reportedly protect property.\nConclusion Violation Established\n14",
