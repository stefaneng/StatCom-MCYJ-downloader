State Worker 1 stated she interviewed Youth A on\n05/11/2020 and a video was available of the incident. I reviewed the video and it\nshowed Youth A and Staff 1 having a confrontation with Staff 1 pointing at Youth A.\nYouth A was approaching Staff 1 on the video and swinging at Staff 1. Staff 1\nresponded by swinging at Youth A which resulted in a struggle between the them.\nOther staff in the area moved in and separated Staff 1 and Youth A, and escorted Staff\n1 away from the area.\n2",
    "Administrator 1 submitted the video, written statements by Staff 2, and Staff 3, and the\ntraining record for Staff 1 on 05/12/2020.\nIn her written statement Staff 2 stated she was in class with Youth A. Staff 1 was\ngetting the residents secure to have lunch. Staff 2 stated Staff 1 was expressing how\nStaff 1 felt about the day when Youth A went to the front of the line. Staff 2 reported\nStaff 1 was pointing his finger in the face of Youth A and hit Youth A in his eye. Staff 2\nreported Youth A then began to swing at Staff 1.\nStaff 3 reported in her written statement that she was in the office and heard Staff 1 tell\nYouth A to “motivate” as they were always waiting on his “bitch ass”. Staff 3 stated she\nconfronted Staff 1 and told him he could not say that to Youth A. Staff 3 described Staff\n1 pointing his finger in the face of Youth A. Staff 1 and Youth A began to tussle and\nfight.

Staff 2 stated Staff 1 was pointing his\nfinger at Youth A and she thought Youth A did walk into Staff 1 pointing his finger. Staff\n2 stated she did not know who the staff member was that separated Staff 1 and Youth\nA. This statement is also reflected in the written report from Staff 2.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 06/24/2020. Youth A stated he was upset and\nwanted to finish a quiz in school when Staff 1 was talking to Youth A. Youth A stated\nStaff 1 poked at Youth A but did not have contact with Youth A initially. Youth A stated\nhe then hit Staff 1 and Staff 1 started to strangle Youth A and they fought. Youth A\nstated other staff intervened, restrained Youth A, and put Staff 1 in the office.
