    "Corrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe agency renewal inspection was completed on 7/6/2023 and the CAP was\napproved on 7/26/2023. The agency was cited for 13 violations, 6 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 6, 2 of the violations stayed the same (FTM's and\ntimely service plans. There was a slight decrease in 1 area (1105's) and there was\nan increase in the number of individual incidents in the other 3 areas (medical\npassports, quality visits and PATP's).\nThe agency interim inspection was completed on 6/29/2022 and the CAP was\napproved on 7/28/2022. The agency was cited for 10 violations, 7 of which were\nrepeated this year. 5 of the 7 violations (medical passports, FTM's, 1105's, PATP's\nand quality visits) have increased in the number of individual incidents of non-\ncompliance this year while the remaining 2 (supervisory approval and timely\nservice plans) are the same. The agency will need to establish additional\ncorrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a reduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed. The Chief Administrator\nindicated the agency has experienced staff turnover over the past review period.\nThe time between hiring new staff and the training period may cause some areas\nwhere requirements are missed. As a result of the previous year's audit the\nagency developed a CAP that they feel has been beneficial in some areas. As a\nresult of the CAP the agency increased training, tracking and close supervisory\nmonitoring. In addition, the agency emphasized weekly review of the Book of\nBusiness as a monitoring tool. The agency also implemented staff conducted\naudits where staff audit two of their own cases and two peer audits. This has\nhelped to ensure documents are properly uploaded and contacts are completed\ntimely.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with two staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency as well as coworkers. Staff did not report any concerns\nthat are specific to the agency but some frustration with some of the systemic\nrequirements.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care, licensing and adoption services. All files were stored\nsecurely including CHRI.\n8",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n______7/25/2024_____________________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7/31/2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n9"
