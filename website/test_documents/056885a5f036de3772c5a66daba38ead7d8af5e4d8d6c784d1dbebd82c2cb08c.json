INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421.\nSection (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family time for\nDescription each child in foster care consistent with the child's service plans,\nas required by R 400.12419 and R 400.12420 to ensure the safety\nand well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The agency has not established parenting time between the birth\nparent and the children and has not explored possible relative\nplacements for them.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant\nOn 11/4/2024 I reviewed the complaint from Complainant to\ndetermine contact. During a telephone contact with Complainant\non 11/7/2024, Complainant reported information as reported by\nBirth Mom.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 11/7/2024 I spoke with CA by telephone related to the\nallegations. CA was surprised by the allegations. She\nacknowledged the agency having the children’s cases that were\nmentioned in the allegations. She reported it was a new case to\nthe agency, and she believed the allegations to be incorrect. She\nreported visits had begun between Birth Mom and the children.\nShe knew that to be correct because the foster care supervisor\nhad expressed concern about Birth Mom being very difficult during\na parent/child visit. CA reported the assigned case worker, Foster\nCare Worker (FCW) is new, but FCW and the foster care\nsupervisor could better speak to these allegations\nBirth Mom\nOn 11/7/2024 I interviewed Birth Mom by telephone related to the\n2",
    "complaint allegations. Birth Mom reported the Child Safe agency\njust reach out to her. She is to have a visit at the agency today\nand tomorrow with Child B and Child C. She said Child A is placed\nwith Child A’s father under the Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS). She expressed concern that DHHS removed\nher three children, had not placed her two younger children, Child\nB and Child C with a relative, and that the children have had three\ndifferent workers since 10/14/2024. She clarified not all three\nworkers were via Child Safe because initially the children were to\nbe placed with Agency 1. She expressed concern the agency may\nbe trying to get her children adopted.\nBirth Mom reported at the time the complaint came in she was\nunable to get in touch with anyone. She reported given the fact\nthat Child Safe has set up visits for her, for now, she wants to hold\noff with any complaints. She wants to see what the agency does\nto service her and the children.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW) & Foster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 11/7/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone. FCW was present\nwith Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) whom she requested to have\nas a support person.\nFCW reported she is new to foster care, and FCS was assisting\nher, which FCS affirmed. Both she and FCS reported the agency\nreceived Child B and Child C’s case around 10/15/2024 at which\ntime Child B was placed in a Child Safe family foster home. Birth\nMom was AWOL with Child C and Child C was not placed with\nChild Safe until 10/18/2024. FCW reported a case transfer\nmeeting with DHHS was unable to occur until 10/24/2024, which\nwas when DHHS provided Birth Mom’s information to Child Safe.\nFCW reported when they got the case there was a lot of\nmiscommunication, because Agency 1 thought they had the\nchildren’s case, though, Child Safe had the family and were also\nassigned the case. FCW reported after numerous emails to\nDHHS, and DHHS finally creating the children placement\ninformation in the MISACWIS system, the agency was able to\ninput information into the system. They also now had Birth Mom’s\ninformation to reach out to her, which they did. FCW reported the\nchildren would have an initial parent/child visit with Birth Mom\ntoday (the day of this interview) and another is also set for\ntomorrow. FCW reported Birth Mom also had contact with the\nchildren on 10/19/2024.\nFCW reported during the case transfer meeting with DHHS,\nDHHS shared with Child Safe there was an uncle whom DHHS\n3",
    "reached out to as a possible relative placement for Child B and\nChild C, but that relative was noncommittal. FCW reported DHHS\nalso advised them of Godmother/Fictive Kin (GMFK) who might be\ninterested in the children. FCW reported she contacted GMFK and\nadvised GMFK that DHHS was completing their clearances. She\ntold GMFK Child Safe would conduct a home assessment visit\nwith them on 11/5/2024; which she did. She reported GMFK’s\nfamily was being explored for placement. She also reported no\nadoption pursuit was occurring and a court hearing on this case is\npending for February. FCW reported the information about the\nagency assessing GMFK was shared with Birth Mom, but Birth\nMom seems to want everything to happen much quicker, though\nFCW explained the timeframes to her.\nFCS did not dispute any information reported by FCW. She\nreported she spoke with Birth Mom on 11/4/2024 and scheduled\nthe parenting time. The agency also had a contact scheduled with\nGMFK. She reported the agency will follow through and assess\nGMFK. She, as did FCW expressed no immediate concern with\nGMFK, but are concerned that Birth Mom could try to take\nadvantage of GMFK, as per DHHS, Birth Mom has made many\nthreats against children service workers. FCS reported the\nagency will safety plan around that.\nDocumentation Review:\nChild B’s and Child C’s MISACWIS case record which showed:\n• Child B (age 7) and Child C (age 2) were made temporary\ncourt wards on 10/10/2024.\n• Child B and Child C were placed in a foster home with\nChild Safe on 10/15/2024 and 10/18/2024 respectively.\n• Child B and Child C were placed with GMFK on\n11/11/2024.\n• Child A (age 16) is placed with her father under DHHS’s\ndirect care and supervision.\n• Parent/child visitation for Birth Mom occurred on\n10/18/2024, 11/7/2024, 11/8/2024, 11/11/2024, 11/13/2024,\nand weekly to twice weekly thereon.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation reviewed, the evidence\ndoes not support the allegations or the reported concerns by Birth\nMom.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code Compliance with the child protection law.\nTitle\n4",
    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12214\nSection (1) An agency shall comply with the child protection law, 1975 PA\nDescription 238, MCL 722.621 to 722.638.\nViolation Potential Rule Violation.\nType\nAllegation A concern of maltreatment against a child was brought up but the\nagency did not report it or open a special evaluation.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 11/19/2024 the above allegation was reported by Complainant,\nand it was merged with the original complaint for its investigation\nas well. During a telephone contact with Complainant on\n11/20/2024, Complainant reported information as reported by Birth\nMom.\nBirth Mom\nOn 11/20/2024 I interviewed Birth Mom by telephone. Birth Mom\nreported while visiting with her children on 11/7/2024, Child C (age\n2) had bruises on her inner legs and a bruise on her nose. She\nsaid when she changed Child C’s diaper, Child C’s vaginal area\nwas purplish and blue. That when she wiped Child C’s vaginal\narea a discharge was seen. She asked Child C if someone\ntouched her, and Child C said, “Daddy” touched her. Birth mom\nreported when she asked FCW about what she saw on Child C,\nFCW said it was a diaper rash. Birth Mom did not believe this. She\nsaid the rash could not have occurred between 10/19/2024 and\nthe date of this parent/child visitation on 11/7/2024. She said\nFCW had not reported the rash to her beforehand and FCW\nseemed concerned when FCW saw the bruises and rash. Birth\nMom said FCW showed her a body chart for Child C, as to show\nmarks Child C had, but that would not explain what she saw.\nBirth Mom admitted once she noticed and complained about what\nshe saw on Child C, the agency took Child C to the hospital for\nexamination. FCW took Child C to the emergency room. FCW\nreported the physician said it was a diaper rash and the doctor\nhad no other concern. Birth Mom expressed concern that she had\nwanted blood work performed on Child C and that did not occur.\nBirth Mom did not report why she wanted blood work and what\nshe thought that would show. She acknowledged the agency told\nher the doctor did not feel the blood work was necessary. Birth\nMom reported she was not allowed to go to the ER related to\nChild C’s examination.\n5",
    "Birth Mom said she asked FCW if there was an investigation of\nthe foster parents, and FCW reported that was not required based\non the doctor’s reporting. Birth Mom reported the children were\nremoved and placed in another foster home, that day, on an\nemergency basis as opposed to a placement with GMFK. Birth\nMom felt given her children’s situation and her concern of\nmaltreatment, the agency should have conducted an investigation\non the foster parents. She also felt Child B and Child C should\nhave been placed with her relative, GMFK immediately.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 11/22/2024 I interviewed CA by telephone related to this\nallegation. CA reported knowing Birth Mom had a concern with\nChild C having a diaper rash. She reported Birth Mom has been\n“complaint happy”, making various complaints. She reported Child\nC was seen by a doctor about the concern.\nCA reported, maltreatment by the foster parents was not why the\nchildren were replaced. The children were replaced for their\nsafety. She reported when children services removed the children\nfrom Birth Mom, Birth Mom apparently placed an “Air Tag” (a\ndevice that helps you locate your belonging using an iPhone\napplication) in one of the children’s belongings, which was found.\nShe reported since Birth Mom had previously been on the run with\nChild C and given Birth Mom’s volatility and her reporting that she\nknew where the foster mother lived, the children were replaced\nfrom that foster home for their safety.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nOn 11/27/2024 I interviewed FCS about this allegation by\ntelephone. FCS said Birth Mom had come for her first visit with\nChild B and Child C at the agency on 11/7/2024. FCS was not\npresent at the visit, but the FCW contacted her. FCW told her the\nvisit was going well until the end of the visit. At the end of the visit\nBirth Mom was changing Child C’s diaper and Birth Mom began\nscreaming that her daughter was being sexually maltreated and\nneeded to be taken to the doctor. The FCW did not report the\ndetails of what Birth Mom saw to warrant her reaction, though she\nmentioned a rash. FCS advised FCW to take Child C to the\nER/Urgent Care for an examination. FCW took Child C to\nBeaumont hospital, on 11/7/2024, and the examination revealed a\ndiaper rash. The doctor did not see any bruising or anything\nrelated to sexual maltreatment. FCS said Birth mom was provided\nthis information, as well as Child C’s well child examination. FCS\naffirmed that Birth Mom was not at the Urgent Care visit due to\nsafety concerns, but FCW exchanged text messages with Birth\n6",
    "Mom that day/evening to keep Birth Mom updated on what was\nhappening. FCS said Birth Mom contacted her the day after Child\nC’s doctor’s visit. Birth Mom was upset, in that Birth Mom was\nloud and confrontational. FCS said she tried to calm Birth Mom\ndown and she answered many questions Birth Mom asked about\nthe child and placement issues.\nFCS reported Child C and Child B were replaced following the\n11/7/2024 incident and concern by Birth Mom, but not due to\nsuspicions of maltreatment by Foster Parent 2 and Foster Parent\n3. Child C had a diaper rash and a report to children service\nintake or a need to conduct a special evaluation on the foster\nhome was not warranted. FCS explained the reason for the\nchildren’s replacement similarly to what the CA reported. FCS\nreported Foster Parent 2 had discovered a number of Air Tags in\nthe children’s belonging; one was discovered in Child C’s shoe.\nOne of the Air Tags was discovered a little before the 11/7/2024\nvisit, and one was discovered the day of the visit. FCS reported\nthey surmised Birth Mom must have placed the Air Tags on the\nchildren’s belongings when Birth Mom was trying to avoid children\nservices removing the children from her care, and or when she\nwas on the run with Child C. FCS reported due to those Air Tags,\nBirth Mom volatile behavior, and that she might know the\nchildren’s location at the foster home, to be safe the agency\ntemporarily placed the children with a respite home provider until\nthey could finish all that was needed to place the children in\nGMFK’s home. The latter of which occurred on 11/11/2024.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nOn 12/6/2024 I interviewed FCW by telephone related to this\nallegation. FCW confirmed information as reported by FCS. FCW\nadded the following additionally information:\n• While Birth Mom was changing Child C diaper Birth Mom\nreported seeing a discoloration between Child C’s legs and\nscreamed and yelled that she wanted the police called.\n• Due to Birth Mom’s behavior other staff persons stepped in\nto assist in dealing with the situation. Specifically Licensing\nSupervisor assisted her. Another worker called the police.\n• Birth Mom told the police she wanted her child taken to the\nhospital. Another worker transported Child B to a respite\nhome while FCW transported Child C for a medical\nexamination.\n• She saw discoloration between Child C inner thighs, but\ndid not know what to make of it or of Birth Mom’s reaction.\nShe took Child C to Beaumont hospital and advised the\n7",
    "doctor of what she saw and the allegation by Birth Mom.\nChild C was examined by two physicians and a nurse.\nThe physician examined Child C’s body and vaginal area.\nThe physician assessed Child C’s discoloration between\nher inners thighs to be a rash not bruising. That Child C\nhad a diaper rash, and it was from chafing and her diapers.\nThe doctor recommended a cream. The physician had no\nconcern that Child C had been sexually maltreated.\n• After she took Child C to the hospital, she stayed in touch\nwith Birth Mom on 11/7/2024 by text. Her supervisor had a\nlengthy conversation with Birth mom the next day about\nthe hospital visit outcome, and the agency’s placement\ndecision for the children.\n• As to Child C having other bruises, such as to her nose or\nbody, on 10/29/2024, the foster parent texted her that\nChild C had fallen and hurt her nose. Additionally, at her\nfirst foster home visit with the foster parents on 10/21/2024\nthe foster mother showed her marks Child C had on Child\nC’s back shoulder and bottom. The foster mother reported\nthe old marks were seen when Child C was placed on\n10/18/2024 and she wanted FCW to know about them.\nThe cause and origin of the marks were unknown. FCW\ndocumented them on a body chart and showed that to\nBirth Mom.\nLicensing Supervisor (LS)\nOn 12/17/2024 I interviewed LS by telephone. LS reported being\npresent at the agency on 11/7/2024. She said FCW asked for the\nlicensing department’s assistance with an incident with Birth Mom\nwho was upset during a parent/child visitation. LS observed Child\nC on a changing table with her pants pulled down. Birth Mom was\nclose in Child C’s face saying, “who touched you” Child C said\n“yes”, at one point. When Birth Mom asked, “who touched you”\nChild C did not respond, and looked startled. LS reported it was\nclear to her that Child C did not understand the questions from\nBirth Mom. LS said Child C is only two years old. LS reported\nBirth Mom accused the foster parents of maltreatment of Child C\nand said she was going to call the police. LS reported an agency\nstaff person called the police, but she was not sure who that staff\nperson was. Birth Mom said she saw bruising between Child C’s\nlegs, but LS said she did not see that. She saw chafing and diaper\ncrud. Birth Mom wanted a medical evaluation and wanted to\naccompany FCW to the hospital with Child C. LS reported the\nagency did not think it was safe for FCW to have the Birth Mom\naccompany her. LS and FCS spoke with Birth Mom while FCW\ntook Child C for a medical exam. Birth Mom told them she was\n8",
    "going to refused to allow the children to go back to the foster\nhome or any other foster home. That the children needed to go to\nthe relative/fictive kin placement. LS said FCS explained to Birth\nMom why the relative/kin placement was not possible this day;\nand the need for other systems (FTM, a safety plan with all\nparities approvals) to be in place before such a placement could\noccur.\nAs to a referral to children services or an initiation of a special\nevaluation on Foster Parent 2 and Foster Parent 3, LS affirmed\nwhat the other staff members interviewed had reported about Air\nTags being found in the children belongings, safety concerns for\nthe children and foster parents; and the agency not having\nconcerns or suspicion of maltreatment by the foster parents.\nDocumentation Review\nChild C’s well child exam dated 11/5/2024 which showed:\n• A normal exam. No concerns or anything unusual was\nnoted on the medical report form.\nChild C’s medical exam from Cordell William Beaumont University\nHospital Pediatric Out Patient Clinic dated 11/7/2024 which\nshowed:\n• The reason for the evaluation was a children service\nevaluation.\n• A diagnoses of diaper rash; irritant contact dermatitis,\nunspecific trigger.\n• The diaper rash diagnosis information form listed reasons\nas to how it was diagnosed, and a list of possible causes;\nnone of which related to maltreatment.\n• No concerns of maltreatment or anything unusual was\nnoted on the hospital medical form.\nChild B’s and Child C’s MISACWIS case record, which showed:\n• Information as documented earlier in this report.\n• A social work contact for 11/4/2024 showing the agency’s\ncontact with Birth Mom about parent/child visitation.\n• A social work contact for 11/7/2024, and a 11/7/2024\nincident report showing documentation of what FCW\nreported when interviewed about the parent/child visit\nincident and hospital visit on 11/7/2024.\n• A 10/21/2024 social work contact of FCW’s initial home\nvisit with the foster parent and Child B and Child C after\ntheir initial placement and reports of the foster parent\nfinding an Air Tag in Child C’s shoe, the children rough\n9",

There is concern the worker is not working toward\nreunification.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAllegation 1\nOn 11/19/2024 the above allegation was reported by Complainant,\nand they were merged with the original complaint for their\ninvestigation as well. On 11/20/2024 during a telephone contact\nwith Complainant, Complainant reported information as reported\nby Birth Mom.\nBirth Mom\nOn 11/20/2024 I interviewed Birth Mom by telephone about the\nallegation. Birth Mom reported the agency did not immediately\nseek to place her children with a relative. She reported her\nchildren should have been placed with a relative when they were\ntaken from her and when the children were replaced from their\nprior foster home with Child Safe, they should have been placed\n10",
    "with GMFK, not in a temporary placement. She believed the\nagency was delaying placement with GMFK because they are\ntrying to delay reunification with her. She gave no specific reasons\nor details to show evidence of this.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 11/22/2024 I interviewed CA by telephone related to this\nallegation. CA reported the foster care worker, and foster\nsupervisor could better speak to the allegation.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS) & Foster Care Worker (FCW)\nI interviewed FCS and FCW about this allegation by telephone on\n11/27/2024 and 12/6/2024 respectively. As noted earlier in the\nreport, both FCS and FCW reported the agency was not delaying\npursuit of a relative placement. Both reported they did not have\naccess to possible relatives’ interest until 10/24/2024. That after\nlearning of GMFK interest, contact was made with GMFK, and a\nhome visit and assessment was initiated on 11/5/2024. They\nreported Child B and Child C were unable to be placed in GMFK\ncare on 11/7/2024 when a respite placement occurred because\nmore information was needed to complete GMFK’s home\nassessment, but the children were placed in GMFK care on\n11/11/2024.\nAllegation 2:\nComplainant\nOn 11/19/2024 the above allegation was reported by Complainant,\nand they were merged with the original complaint for its\ninvestigation as well. On 11/20/2024 during a telephone contact\nwith Complainant, Complainant reported information as reported\nby Birth Mom.\nBirth Mom\nOn 11/20/2024 I interviewed Birth Mom by telephone about the\nallegation. Birth Mom reported the children service worker\nreported she had completed a trauma screening for Child B and\nChild C, but on 10/23/2024 the judge ordered that one be\ncompleted by the agency. Birth Mom was not clear as to whether\nwhat had to be conducted was a trauma screening or a trauma\nassessment. She reported the former was ordered and reported\nthe agency had not completed one. Birth Mom did not take into\nthe account the time required to complete an assessment\nfollowing a referral she felt the assessment should have been\ncompleted already.\nChief Administrator (CA)\n11",
    "On 11/22/2024 I interviewed CA by telephone related to this\nallegation. CA reported the foster care worker, and foster\nsupervisor could better speak to the allegation.\nFoster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nI interviewed FCS about this allegation by telephone on\n11/27/2024. FCS reported the court ordered a trauma\nassessment not a trauma screening. She reported due to the\ndelay of Child Safe receiving the placement assignment in the\nsystem from DHHS they were delayed in being able to generate\nthe referral. She reported they have had contact with the two\nagencies that would likely complete the trauma assessment. She\nreported given that Child C is under three, an Early on\nassessment was also needed and the referral was completed by\nDHHS prior to Child Safe receiving the case. FCS said contact by\nEarly on with the current caregiver was still pending.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nI interviewed FCW about this allegation by telephone on\n12/6/2024.

    "summary": "A special investigation was conducted into Child Safe Michigan Judson CS following allegations from a birth mother. The investigation covered three areas: failure to establish visitation and explore relative placements, failure to report suspected maltreatment, and failure to perform a trauma assessment while delaying relative placement. The investigation found that the agency had initiated visitation, was actively assessing a relative placement (children were placed with a godmother/fictive kin), and had no basis to report suspected maltreatment after a medical examination concluded a diaper rash was present, not abuse. The agency appropriately responded to the birth mother's concerns by taking the child for a medical exam and moving the children to a respite home due to safety concerns stemming from the birth mother's behavior and discovered AirTags, not due to suspected foster parent maltreatment. The evidence did not support any of the allegations, and no violations were established. The agency acted properly and was not found culpable for any wrongdoing.",
