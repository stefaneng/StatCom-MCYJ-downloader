    "Rule Code & CPA Rule 400.12505 Supervision.\nSection (2) An agency shall provide the following minimum supervision:\nDescription (b) At monthly intervals, ensure that the youth is complying with\nthe terms of the contract required by R 400.12510, continues to\nreside in a safe and acceptable environment, and is managing\nexpenditures.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff are to ensure youth are residing in a safe acceptable\nenvironment, but youth does not feel safe and there are concerns\nthese needs are not adequately being met by the agency.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nProgram Manager was informed of the allegation in person at the\nindependent living home on 3/8/2023. When informed that Youth\nC reported feeling unsafe in the home, she responded that his\nbehaviors were creating and unsafe environment in the home.\nFoster Care Worker 1 (FCW 1) was interviewed at the agency\noffice 3/8/2023. FCW 1 reported that Youth C has not reported\nfeeling unsafe in the home to her. She stated she has verified his\nsafety and the appropriateness of the placement during her\nrequired visits with him. She reported he has created an unsafe\nenvironment due to his behavior, and provided the following\nexamples:\n• Youth C makes racist comments and says things to\nantagonize other youths in the home.\n• Youth C acts privileged around the other youths and\nmakes demands of staff.\n• Youth C stole the clothing of the other youths in the home.\n• Youth C had his girlfriend hiding in the attic of the home\nand when she was discovered by a staff member, Youth C\nbecame angry and grabbed that staff member by the\nhoodie. When another youth saw this, he hit Youth C,\nwhich started a fight amongst Youth C, Youth C’s girlfriend,\nand the other youths in the home.\nOn 3/10/2023 an email was sent to FCW 1 to inquire about Youth\nC’s current placement as it had been updated in his case record to\nreflect that he was moved from the independent living home and\ncase management responsibility had returned to the MDHHS\nwhere Youth C’s case originated. FCW 1 responded stating a 30-\n2",
    "day removal notice had been in place due to Youth C’s racist\ncomments and threats to other youths and the staff of the home.\nHe was moved on 3/9/2023 after Youth A arrived at the agency\noffice beating on the windows, cursing, and demanding they open\nthe door. When asked what he wanted, he refused to answer, so\nthe police were called. Youth C then left and Program Manager\nsubmitted a request for immediate replacement. FCW 1 does not\nknow where Youth C was placed by his MDHHS worker.\nFoster Care Worker 2 (FCW 2) who is Youth C’s MDHHS worker\nwas emailed on 3/10/2023 to inquire about Youth C’s current\nplacement. She responded that Youth C was moved on 3/9/2023,\nafter hours, to an independent living placement with a friend. She\nreported Community Care Organization’s independent living home\nis the second independent living home he has been asked to\nleave for his aggressive behavior and refusal to participate in\nservices. She stated he has never told her that he felt unsafe at\nthe home but did tell her he wanted to be moved back to his home\ncounty. In a follow-up email, FCW 2 reported that Youth C had\npreviously threatened to file complaints against the independent\nliving home in which he lived prior to moving to Community Care\nOrganization.\nOn 3/17/2023 FCW 2 was interviewed by phone. She stated she\nwas Youth C’s direct foster care worker prior to his placement in\nthe Community Care Organization independent living home at\nwhich time they took over case management; however, she\nremained as the monitor on the case and maintained contact with\nYouth C. Since he left that home, FCW 2 has been reassigned as\nhis direct worker. She reported Youth C is a challenging youth and\ncaused a lot of problems while placed at Community Care\nOrganization’s independent living home. She reported he got\naggressive with one staff causing other youth in home to\nintervene. FCW 2 stated that, when Youth C describes that\nincident, he states he was almost paralyzed even though he is the\none who pushed another youth down the stairs. FCW 2 reported\nYouth C called her on 3/14/2023 to tell her he was in a psychiatric\nhospital from 3/12/2022 – 3/14/2023. When she spoke with Youth\nC, she asked him to respond to my efforts to reach him, to which\nhe responded, “I am just going to forget about it.”\nYouth C/Complainant was interviewed by phone on 3/17/2023.\nHe reported the following as concerns that made him feel unsafe:\n• There was an incident during which he thought he heard\nanother youth and a staff fighting upstairs, but he did not\n3",
    "see what happened. This allegation was previously\ninvestigated in 2023C0000208.\n• There is a staff member who walks in on youths in the\nshower. This allegation was previously investigated in\n2023C0000210.\n• There was an incident after which Youth C was burning\nincense in his room and when a staff member came to his\nroom, they discovered his girlfriend was there, against\nhouse rules. He stated he started calling the staff member\nnames and told her he would “come for the whole\nprogram.” He stated the staff said he grabbed her by the\nhoodie, which he denies. Another youth in the home then\nhit Youth C and pushed him into a wall, after which Youth C\nthrew that youth down the stairs. Youth C’s girlfriend hit\nanother youth in the home after which Youth C and his\ngirlfriend left. Youth C reported that, after that incident,\nProgram Manager was disrespectful to him. Youth C\nreported he had a recording of her cussing him out. I\nlistened to the recording during which Program Manager\nwas talking to him about having had his girlfriend at the\nhouse, putting his hands on a staff member, and violating\nthe house rules. She was talking to him about the rules of\nthe program as well as other programming in which he is\ninvolved.\n• On one occasion his girlfriend recorded a conversation she\nhad with a staff member during which the staff member\nreferred to Youth C as a “white boy” and talked “trash”\nabout him. He later sent a copy of the recording and stated\nhis girlfriend started recording after the staff member called\nhim “white boy”, so it wasn’t on the recording. The\nrecording did include Youth C’s girlfriend talking to another\nperson negatively about her relationship with Youth C. The\ndiscussion sounded as if she and Youth C had an\nargument or break up and the other person on the\nrecording, who Youth C reported was a staff member, was\nsupporting Youth C’s girlfriend.\n• There were some youths “talking shit about him” and an\nunidentified staff member just laughed.\n• He witnessed a staff member, Staff 1, smoking marijuana\nwith youth in the independent living home. Youth C did not\nremember when this occurred, and he did not report this to\n4",
    "anyone. This allegation is being investigated in\n2023C0000299.\nDOCUMENTS REVIEWED\n• Case Record: Youth C was placed in the independent living\nhome from 12/9/2022 until 3/9/2023.\n• Case Record: Updated Service Plan dated 1/10/2023 was\nreviewed and all required face to face contacts in the\nyouth’s placement were made.\n• Case Contacts: Face to face contact was made with the\nyouth at the home on 12/9, 12/15, 12/21, 1/9, 1/18, 2/8, and\n2/13. None of the case contacts documented that the youth\nreported feeling unsafe in the home.\n• Case contact: A case contact dated 2/24/2023 documented\nthat Youth C had his girlfriend hiding in the home’s attic.\nOnce discovered, Youth C and his girlfriend started yelling\nand calling other youths names, pushed another youth\ndown the stairs causing injury, and jumped another youth.\n• Text Message: Screenshot of text message provided by\nFCW 2 dated 11/2/2022 from Youth C stating “I reported\n[previous IL home] to the abuse and neglect hotline so\neveryone should look for a backup job. You made my life\nextremely hard and keep protecting [name removed] so I’m\ntaking [previous IL home] off the map.”\nAnalysis Youth C reported multiple concerns he alleged made him feel\nunsafe; however, each of these concerns were previously\ninvestigated, were caused by Youth C’s own actions, or were not\nsafety related. Youth C’s case managers report that Youth C has\na history of making threats against agencies and never reported\nany safety related to concerns to them.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n5",
