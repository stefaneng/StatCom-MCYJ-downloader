It states that on an unknown\ndate sometime ago that a former unknown staff person gave\nYouth A some wine. It is unknown where it took place in the\nfacility. When asked about the alleged incident later, Youth A\ndenied it ever happening and got angry. Complainant and Case\nManager report no other additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth A onsite with DHHS Worker on 07/03/2023.\nHe reports being placed at the facility in 04/2023. He denies staff\never giving him wine while at the facility and does not know why\nsomeone would state such an allegation. He denies having\nknowledge of any resident being given contraband by staff. He\nreports he and other residents have attempted to give staff money\nto purchase such items as potato chips and Brisk iced teas.\nYouth A goes on to report the physician prescribing another\nunknown resident the nicotine patch and gum on one occasion.\nI interviewed Manager onsite with DHHS Worker on 07/03/2023a\nand 07/28/2023. She has no knowledge of any former or current\nstaff giving Youth A or any other residents wine. She also states\nthat residents are not allowed to have money in their possession\nwhile at the facility. She reports residents on occasion being in\npossession of money which she states comes from youth’s prior\nplacement, pan handling while on AWOL, or from visitors.\nI interviewed Staff Person 1, via telephone, with DHHS Worker on\n07/05/2023. She does not have any knowledge of a former or\ncurrent staff person giving any residents wine or any other form of\ncontraband. Staff Person 1 was interviewed because DHHS\nWorker was required to interview another staff person per policy.\nDHHS Worker reports no actions taken by her department.\n2",
    "Analysis There is no evidence of Youth A being given wine by a former or\ncurrent staff member. Youth A denies ever being given wine by a\nstaff member and does not know of any resident to have received\nwine or any contraband as well.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV.
