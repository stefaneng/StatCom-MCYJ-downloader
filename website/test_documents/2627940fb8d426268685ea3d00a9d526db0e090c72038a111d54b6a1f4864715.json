She reported Staff 1 and 2 are present today, but Staff 3 is off this week.\nI observed Youth A at the facility on 03/15/2022.

    "Documents reviewed for the investigation:\n Facility’s Behavioral Management Policy.

Youth A exhibits ongoing\naggressive behaviors such as tantrum, biting, pinching, swearing, scratching,\nshoving, throwing toys, and swearing/name calling. Staff are to ignore and\nredirect Youth A when he displays negative behavior and are to encourage\npositive behavioral support.\n Incident Report and body chart dated 03/14/2022 completed by Director 1.
