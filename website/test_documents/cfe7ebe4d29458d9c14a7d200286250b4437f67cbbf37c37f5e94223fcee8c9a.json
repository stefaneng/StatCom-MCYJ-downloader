    "self-harming. Youth C said does see her therapist weekly and is\ncurrently on 1:1 staffing due to self-harming. Youth C said there\nwas a staff member on her wing during the incident and she did\nnot express any concerns regarding staff supervision.\nI interviewed Staff 1 at the facility on 05/31/2023. Staff 1 was the\nassigned direct care worker to Youth A 05/13/2023. She reported\non 05/13/2023 Youth A was being very defiant, verbally\naggressive, and didn’t want to go to bed. She said Staff 5 was\nstanding by the staff’s desk holding his badge, Youth A snatched\nhis badge, ran, and opened the wing door. Youth A proceeded to\nopen two other wing doors, and Youth B and C also came out of\nthe units. Several staff members tried talking to Youth A, B, and C\nto go back to their rooms, but Youth A and B were being very\ndefiant, so law enforcement was contacted to assist. Youth C was\ntriggered by the situation and sat on the floor and attempted to cut\nherself. EMS was contacted, and Youth C was transported to the\nhospital.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 05/31/2023. Staff 2 stated\nshe was contacted to assist with the “clear”. She saw Youth C\ntaking out a piece of metal from her bra and used to self-harm.\nStaff 4 took the piece of metal from Youth C and EMS and the\npolice were contacted.

Staff 3\nsaid Youth A and B were being very defiant and refusing to go\nback on the wing, so law enforcement was contacted to assist.\nYouth C sat on the floor and was self-harming. EMS and the\npolice were contacted. Youth C was transported to the hospital.\nYouth A initially was being defiant, but after talking to her she\nagreed to go back to her wing. Youth B continued to be defiant\nand assaulted staff, and had to be restrained.\nI interviewed Staff 4 at the facility on 05/31/2023. Staff 4 was the\nassigned direct care worker to for Youth B. Staff 4 reported Youth\nA snatched Staff 5’s badge, used the badge to open her wing door\nand opened the wing door for Youth B. A clear was called and\nstaff attempted to redirect Youths back to their wings. Youth A and\nB refused to cooperate, so law enforcement was contacted to\nassist. Youth C broke her headphones and used a piece a metal\nto self-harm, staff immediately took the metal piece and called\nEMS.\n3",
    "I spoke with Consumer Rights Officer on 05/31/2023. He reported\nStaff 5 resigned on 05/30/2023 due to being assaulted by a youth\non 05/30/2023, therefore Staff 5 was unable to be interviewed.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Incident report dated 05/13/2023 at 10:45pm for verbal and\nphysical aggression and self-harm was consistent with staff\ninterviews.\n• Incident report dated 05/13/2023 at 11:40 pm, for physical\nrestraint. Youth B was being defiant, refusing to go back to\nher room, and physically assaulted staff. Staff conducted a\nCPI physical management from 11:40 pm to 11:43 pm.\n• Staff 5 does not have disciplinary action in his personnel\nrecords.\nAnalysis The facility is compliant with the rule as there is insufficient\nevidence that staff were not supervising youths, based on\ninterviews with Staff, Youths, and documentation. Staff and Youth\nreported Youth A grabbed staff’s keys out of their hand and\nopened the wing door.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nJuly 3, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 5, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nProgram Manager\n4"
