Staff 2 reported Staff 3 attempted to call the On-call\nsupervisor and Director right away. Staff 2 attempted to call the On-call supervisor at\n2:42 am and left a message. She then called Director at 2:55am for support and he\nreturned her call at 4:15am. On the phone call with Director, she informed him the\nyouth have not returned and she was unaware of their location.

    "am that Youth A called asking to be picked up by staff. Staff 3 reported she called\nDirector and there was no answer. She then called the On-call supervisor phone line\nbut there was no answer.

Staff 1 gave the direction that Director should be there for support. Staff 3\nreported she was in constant communication with Staff 2 as well about who she was\ncalling and reported Director called Staff 2 around 4 am.

He reported he spoke with\nStaff 1 prior to the youth calling to be picked up due to the concerns of Staff 2 and\nStaff 3 being the only staff on campus and how to support the youth returning from\nAWOL. Director reported he told Staff 1 that if there was help needed Staff 1 was to\ncontact the Director and he would come sit at the house to help with the return to\nAWOL protocol. He believes there was miscommunication as Director expected\nStaff 1 to remain the on-call supervisor and contact Director directly not take over as\non-call supervisor duties. Director reported he heard staff called the on-call\nsupervisor. Director reported the staff then called his phone a couple of hours later\nbecause they could not get ahold of the on-call supervisor.
