    "decompensating and was hospitalized and transitioned to an inpatient facility. This\nyouth was 17 years old and had been in placement for approximately 12-months\nbefore this incident. The Chief Administrator identified several actions step to ensure\nstaff are aware of any decompensation of youth and share this information with\nadministration who will share with the referral source. This will also be an issue that is\naddressed during the quarterly FTM meetings, and the Director of Youth Services will\nspeak to each youth weekly to assess their functioning. These contacts will be\ndocumented and shared with the Chief Administrator. The goal is to avoid any future\nunplanned discharges, especially of this nature. The facility will also request weekly\nupdates when a youth is ready for discharge and before they show signs of\ndecompensation. The facility will assist the youth in seeking community placement\noptions as they are nearing the successful completion of their program.\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted will all the youth currently in the program. They report\nfeeling safe and benefiting from the program. Each shared a positive interaction with\nstaff and attending therapy sessions weekly.

Each were able to identify their\ntraining, especially with a focus on trauma. The supervisors and administration staff\ninterviewed reported some frustration with the struggles in the presenting problems in\nsome youth but believe they have been successful in providing a level of open\ntreatment care that is beneficial to the youth.\n5",
