Youth E stated staff were calm, helpful, and available\nfor youth to talk to. Youth E said they attended school and had\ntherapy 1-2 times per week. The facility offered a lot of activities to\nyouth such as movies, scheduled events, arts/crafts, games, and\norganized group events.

Activities included Science Technology Engineering\nMath (STEM) activities, basketball, holiday party, Lego activities,\nmovies, and a content creator workshop.\n4",
    "Rights Officer was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n1/15/25. Rights Officer reported the facility was partnering with\nWayne County Community Mental Health to complete on-site\nscreenings for Wayne MDHHS youth, to determine if they are in\nneed of short-term hospitalization. On 1/21/25 Rights Officer\nclarified via email that JTS was a program within Vista Maria that\norganized events such as groups and dances, where instructors\nwere brought to campus. Recently they had a hair show and a\nfamily movie day for the youth. Dream Realized through\nEducation/Empowerment and Mentoring (DREAM) was a group\nthat was part of JTS that also offers group activities to youth on\ncampus. Heart Warmers was a spiritual group that youth could\nparticipate in on Sundays. Rights Officer confirmed that all of\nthese groups remain active on campus.\nQuality Manager was contacted via email on 1/23/25 regarding\nthe plans to revamp services on campus. Quality Manager\nreported there was a work group developed by the Activities &\nAcademic Support Manager. The work group was reviewing\ncurrent activities and creating new programming activities to\nengage the youth. Previously the facility contracted with outside\npartners for activities. There was also a restructured client\nadvisory board, similar to a student council, to provide youth with\nmore of a voice in decisions that were made. Youth would be able\nto bring any issues, concerns, wishes, requests to the group for\ndiscussion and decision making.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager (AASM) was contacted\nvia email on 1/23/25. AASM outlined the following items available\nto youth on campus: afterschool activities include but are not\nlimited to, expressive therapies such as yoga, dance movement\ntherapy, music therapy, art therapy, physical activity and\nnutritional health education. Academic mentoring and tutoring are\nsupported through the DREAM program as it connects each youth\nwith mentors who are successful in their career paths and provide\nsupports by focusing on their education and future career goals. In\naddition, the activity team provides programing that creates a safe\nenvironment to strengthen coping skills, promote social\nconnections, and support healthy self-esteem and confidence\nthrough creative self-care strategies. Lastly, the Transition to\nIndependence Process (TIP) model, supports the youth in areas\nof education, employment, social skills, relationships and health,\nand life skills.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24.\nStaff 1 stated activities available to youth included games, books,\n5",
    "planned daily activities, and groups. Youth also attended school\nand therapy. When youth had physically aggressive behaviors that\nmade it unsafe for them to participate in group activities, they\nwould be restricted from activity. When youth were physically\naggressive, staff spoke with them to try to calm them down. Crisis\nPrevention Institute (CPI) techniques were also used when youth\nwere physically aggressive and harming themselves or others. If a\nyouth had any injuries, they were seen by the nurse or taken to\nthe hospital if needed. Police were sometimes called to the facility\nif youth were assaulting staff, and staff were unable to get them to\nstop. Police often took youth to the hospital, rather than to\ndetention. Staff always accompanied youth to the hospital.\nStaff 2 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24 and\n12/2/24. Staff 2 reported youth had planned group activities every\nday. Youth were also able to play games, read and color. Some\nyouth were not able to participate in activities if they had unsafe\nbehavior. Some youth caused ‘clears’ off and on all day, which\nwas disruptive to the daily schedule. Youth caused a lot of\ndamage and broke things for no reason. Some youth broke doors\nor took screws off of wall plates with the intent to swallow them. If\nthere were any serious incidents of physical altercation, police\nwere called to assist. Before calling the police, staff would talk to\nyouth, block, and try to redirect, but that was not always\nsuccessful. Managers and the clinical team decided when the\npolice would be called. Youth were seen by the nurse or taken to\nthe hospital if they were injured or suicidal. Staff accompanied\nyouth to the hospital. Staff 2 stated she felt some youth took no\naccountability and had no interest in completing the program.\nSome youth acted out constantly until they were sent to the\nhospital, because that was where they want to be.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24.\nStaff 3 reported they were new to the facility and still learning.\nActivities for the youth included school, free time, planned group\nactivities, chores, organized activities by programs on campus,\nand free time in which youth could read, draw or watch television.\nYouth also attended therapy weekly and had nightly phone calls.\nStaff 3 did not have experience with police coming to campus or\nyouth going to the hospital. However, they indicated it was the\nsupervisor’s decision when to make those calls.\nStaff 4 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24.\nStaff 4 stated when youth were escalated, staff would talk with\nthem about the issue and redirect if they were physically acting\nout. Physical intervention was only used if youth were injuring\n6",
    "themselves or others. A second interview occurred on 12/2/24.\nStaff 4 reported that when youth were physically violent, staff\nwould block and redirect. Some youth had been physically\naggressive, swinging fists at staff, running at staff, taking screws\nout of doors and wall plate covers to swallow. Staff intervened to\nstop them, but sometimes the supervisors or clinical team would\ndecide the police needed to be contacted. Police would assist\nwhen youth were very violent and not calming down. Police\ngenerally took youth to the hospital, not jail or detention. Staff\naccompany youth to the hospital.\nStaff 5 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 11/25/24.\nStaff 5 reported being new to the facility and still learning. Staff 5\nobserved that a “clear” was called on the unit when youth were\nescalated, and the situation was unsafe for other youth. Staff\nwould talk to the youth and try to problem solve and deescalate\nthe situation. If youth attempted to harm themselves, they were\ntaken to the hospital for evaluation. If youth assaulted peers or\nstaff, the police would be called if the supervisors or clinical team\ndetermined it is necessary.\nStaff 6 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/2/24.\nStaff 6 stated youth got aggressive at times. Staff would try to\ndeescalate, block, redirect, and switch out if needed. If youth were\nphysically hurting someone, a restraint may be used. Police were\nonly called if the youth was continuously physically assaulting\npeople. This decision was made by supervisors. If the police\nassisted, they generally took youth to the hospital for an\nevaluation. For other, minor incidents, youth were seen on-site by\nthe nurse. Staff 6 reported that it was difficult to do group activities\nwhen there were frequent behavior issues.\nStaff 7 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 12/2/24.\nStaff 7 reported she was involved in several ‘clears’ with Youth A.\nYouth A would engage in behavior such as breaking signs to\nmake weapons, pulling ceiling tiles down, kicking windows, pulling\nscrews out of the wall, pulling wires out of the ceiling,\nyelling/swearing, and attacking staff. Staff would provide multiple\nredirections, engage in calm conversation, joke, and distract\nyouth. Youth A would deescalate briefly, but never fully calm\ndown. Staff increased supervision and tried to increase activities\nto keep youth busy, such as playing games, crafts,\ndrawing/coloring, watching television, or doing hair. However,\nYouth A would continue to act out to elicit reactions from staff. If\nstaff would not react, Youth A would escalate and attack staff.\nPolice have been called to assist, after a supervisor gave the\n7",
    "approval. Staff would then follow police to the hospital to sit with\nyouth.\nStaff 8 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/3/25. Staff\n8 stated when youth act out, staff talk with them, redirect, and try\nto get them to focus on something else. If staff were unsuccessful,\nthey may swap out with another staff or call a supervisor for\nassistance. The supervisor may make the decision to call the\npolice for assistance if a youth was continuously physically\naggressive or harming themselves. Youth may then be taken to\nthe hospital by police.\nStaff 9 was interviewed by phone on 1/16/25. Staff 9 stated youth\nparticipated in daily activities of school, chores, meals, therapy,\ncrafts, organized group activities, time in the calming room,\nwatching television, reading and journaling. Some youth chose not\nto participate, and others were not able to participate at times due\nto unsafe behavior. Police may be called to the unit when a youth\nwas escalated for an extended amount of time and staff efforts to\ncalm them did not work. Behaviors such as attacking peers or self-\nharm would cause supervisors to give permission for the police to\nescort a youth to the hospital to be evaluated. Staff always\nfollowed the police and stayed with youth at the hospital.\nStaff 10 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/15/25.\nStaff 10 reported youth participated in counseling groups every\nafternoon, DREAM programs weekly, Alcoholics Anonymous\nweekly for those that need it, games, crafts, coloring, schoolwork,\nand other activities that were scheduled on campus. Staff 10\nindicated there was not much down time, as youth tend to have\nmore behavioral issues if they were not busy. Police may be\ncalled to campus when a youth was continuously or seriously\nattacking someone and staff could not deescalate, or if a youth\nself-harmed or was suicidal. For self-harm and suicidal thoughts\nyouth typically saw the nurse first, then went to the hospital if\nneeded. The clinical director would decide when youth should be\nseen at the hospital.\nStaff 11 was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on 1/15/25.\nStaff 11 stated youth participate in JTS groups which offered\ncooking, music, creative writing, and other activities. However,\nattendance had been limited due to youth behavior. When youth\nwere escalated, staff would talk with them, problem solve and\noffer use of the calming room when needed. Police may be called\nif youth were attacking people and refusing to stop, or if youth\nwere injured. Police would then take the youth to the hospital.\n8",
    "However, that did not happen as often as before, due to hospitals\nrefusing to see some youth from the facility. This was due to some\nyouth acting out over and over with the intention of going to the\nhospital to get food and watch television. A crisis team has come\nto the facility to complete an assessment to determine if the youth\nneeded to be hospitalized. This group assessed Youth A recently\nand determined she did not need to go. Unfortunately, Youth A\ncontinued to act out and had eight incident reports in four days.\nTherapist 1 was interviewed by phone on 1/24/25. Therapist 1\nwas assigned to Youth A. Therapist 1 stated youth on campus\nparticipated in individual therapy, group work, JTS activities,\nDREAM program, Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics\nAnonymous, structured activities with volunteer groups,\noccupational therapy, religious services, and receive support from\nyouth counselors. JTS has pro-social life skills, games, yoga,\ndance, sports and art. DREAM offers life skills, vocational training,\nexercise and mentorship. On the unit, youth participated in art,\ngames, movies, crafts, activities in the courtyard, and outings in\nthe community. These activities may be modified at times, due to\nyouth behavioral or safety issues. Therapist 1 stated youth receive\nat least 1 hour of therapy per week, which may be broken up into\nsmaller sessions, depending on the youth. Therapist 1 reported\nYouth A was refusing to attend therapy for a while but has\nconsistently participated over the last week. Youth A was engaged\nand able to talk and process some things. In prior weeks, Youth A\nwas very escalated and refused to participate. Regarding police or\nhospital involvement, Therapist 1 stated police may be called to\ncampus if youth had violent behaviors and attacked staff or peers.\nPolice would not be called until after staff made several efforts to\ndeescalate the youth. A supervisor, clinical director and the\npsychiatrist would determine when police would be called to\ncampus. Generally, this decision was made when a youth needed\nto be evaluated, but staff did not feel they could safely transport\nthe youth. Therapist 1 stated she had some experience with the\nnew process of having Wayne County Community Mental Health\ncomplete an assessment on-site, in lieu of going to the hospital.\nThe assessment was well done and determined Youth A needed\ninpatient services. However, none of the hospitals would accept\nYouth A as they felt her behavior was too significant. Therapist 1\nplanned to continue looking for an inpatient program for Youth A.\nIn the meantime, everyone continues to work hard to keep Youth\nA and others safe.\nTherapist 2 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 2\nwas assigned to Youth B. Therapist 2 stated they recently began\n9",
    "working with this youth as their previous therapist left the facility.\nTherapist 2 reported Youth B participated in therapy 1-2 times per\nweek. Youth B was also offered group therapy, expressive\ntherapies, recreational therapy through JTS. JTS included Science\nTechnology Education Math activities, mentoring and educational\ntutoring. Youth also received occupational therapy, psychiatric,\nmedical, and family engagement services. While on their unit\nyouth were also able to play games, participate in art, watch\ntelevision, and participate in groups. Therapist 2 stated Youth B\nattended therapy regularly. Although they always engaged,\nTherapist 2 was still assessing Youth B as they had only worked\ntogether for a few weeks. Regarding police or hospital\ninvolvement, their services may be needed if a youth was highly\nescalated to an extent that it was a safety concern, and they were\nunable to regulate themselves or be deescalated. Sometimes\nphysical intervention could be used, but that was not always safe,\nespecially with a youth that was self-harming or physically\naggressive. The unit manager, clinical director or head consulting\npsychiatrist made the determination if youth should be sent to the\nhospital. Therapist 2 stated the facility began working with Wayne\nCounty Community Mental Health (CMH) to complete\nassessments at the facility rather than visiting the hospital.\nTherapist 2 did not have any experience with this service yet.\nTherapist 3 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 3\nreported that youth at the facility were offered therapy, psychiatrist\nappointments, occupational therapy, DREAM, life skills, leadership\nskills, and afterschool activities such as sports, art, and dance.\nYouth attended therapy twice per week on a flexible schedule that\nworked best for the youth. Regarding police and hospital services,\nyouth were sent to the hospital when there was a suicide attempt\nor AWOL. Youth were also sent if they were highly aggressive\ntoward others, and staff had been unsuccessful at calming them\ndown. The police may be called to safely escort youth to the\nhospital upon approval by the clinical supervisor and director.\nTherapist 3 noted the facility was also working with Wayne County\nCMH, as they would come on site to complete assessments for\nyouth, rather than sending the youth to the hospital.\nTherapist 4 was interviewed by phone on 1/23/25. Therapist 4\nreported youth were offered activities such as games, art, gym,\ndance class, and cooking class. Therapist 4 stated youth may feel\nthat they are not doing as many activities lately, but this is due to\nsome programs being revamped. Some activities may be\nrestricted if the youth were physically aggressive. For example,\ninstead of using colored pencils that may be sharp, a youth could\n10",
    "be given crayons to draw. In addition to activities, youth also\nattended individual and family therapy, and occupational therapy.\nIn therapy they worked on triggers and warning signs, coping\nskills, thinking/feeling, and discuss problem solving. Regarding\nhospitalization and police contact, Therapist 4 reported youth may\nbe escorted to the hospital by police if they had continued\nescalated physical aggression, self-harming, or suicidal behavior\nthat staff were unable to reduce after multiple attempts to help the\nyouth self-regulate. The clinical supervisor and clinical director\nmust make the determination if assistance is to be called.\nTherapist 4 also reported the facility began a partnership with\nWayne County CMH, where CMH staff would complete on-site\nassessments to determine if a youth was eligible for short term\nhospitalization.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Vista Maria Program Statement updated 3/22/2024: Direct\nProgram Services: “weekly individual therapy, monthly\nfamily and group therapy, sensory integration approaches,\nexpressive therapies, group counseling focused on\nintervention, non-violent crisis interventions approaches,\ncommunity outings, daily recreation, after-school activities,\nnursing services, mentoring, life skills education, family\nvisitation and phone call opportunities, transportation to\nhome visits when appropriate, family engagement events,\nand aftercare services for six months after discharge.\nContracted services include on-campus education,\npsychiatric and psychological evaluations, medical, optical,\nand dental examinations.”\n• “Youth log of daily expectations”: Staff must indicate if\nyouth met expected behavior standards for the following\nactivities: social skills, peer interaction, school/study time,\npersonal care, group participation, recreation participation,\nroom care/chores, healthy eating, appropriate dress,\neffective coping skills, safe behavior/transport.\n• ‘Emergency Psychiatric Care” policy dated July 2014.\n• If client is in imminent danger of harming herself or\nothers, supervisor/team leader/staff contacts 911.\n• If the situation is serious but there is no imminent\ndanger, arrange for staff or private ambulance\ntransport to appropriate psychiatric crisis\nassessment center.\n• Staff should not transport an uncontrollable client.

However, Youth A,\nYouth C, Youth E, Youth F, Youth G, Staff 1, Staff 2, Staff 6,\nand Staff 11 reported that activities did not always occur. Youth\nand staff indicated there was increased acting out behavior when\nactivities did not occur, or when youth were placed on wing\nrestriction from activities. Youth and staff reported concerns that\nthe agency’s behavior management/reward system was not\neffective. Youth and staff reported concerns that staff spend too\nmuch time deescalating certain youth and therefore not\ncompleting activities with other youth.\nDuring interviews Youth A, Youth B, Youth E and Youth F\nreported a lack of outdoor activities available to all youth.\nActivities & Academic Support Manager provided\ndocumentation of several indoor activities made available for\nyouth. However, no outdoor activities were identified.\nDuring a call on 2/6/25, Chief Administrator and Quality\nManager reported that youth participate in outdoor activity when\nthe weather permits. However, they were unsure if there was a\n15",
    "schedule of outdoor activities. They were asked to provide\ndocumentation to show that youth were participating in outdoor\nactivity on a regular basis. In subsequent emails on 2/10/25 and\n2/14/25, Quality Manager reported they did not have any\ndocumentation to verify this request.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nWeekly and monthly unit schedules were reviewed that had\nschedule activities documented such as daily group, daily phone\ncalls, therapy, physical activity, JTS, “Chicktime” with volunteer\ngroup, Vista Maria reads (Book Ladies), Lost Voices Concert,\ntown hall meeting, Boots & Bites with Lace Up Detroit, Pet\nTherapy, holiday events with Abhi Shah Foundation, holiday\ndecorating, and youth health fair.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as youth reported being\nunable to participate in activities due to peer behavior, or not\nhaving any activities available to them while on wing restriction.\nYouth also reported they are not able to engage in outdoor activity\nand the agency did not have any documentation to verify outdoor\nactivities occur with youth.\nCONSULTATION:\nConsultation was offered regarding youth behavior on units that\ndisrupt the daily activities. When disruptive behavior is ongoing\nand prohibiting other youth from their daily activities, efforts should\nbe made to continue activities with youth in another area, away\nfrom the disruption. Not only would this be a positive step for the\nother youth, but it would also take away the acting out youth’s\npower to control the daily activity of the unit. Additionally, for youth\nplaced on restriction that are missing activities, staff should\ncontinue to focus on encouraging the youth to reduce behaviors in\norder to re-join the group. This may help alleviate the youth’s\nfeeling that wing restriction is never ending. Lastly, inclusion of\nsome restricted youth ideas in the client advisory board would be\na great way to determine some activities that restricted youth may\nbe interested in, to help them increase engagement in the\nprogram.\nConclusion Violation Established\n16",
