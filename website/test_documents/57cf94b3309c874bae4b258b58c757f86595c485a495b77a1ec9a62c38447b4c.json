The\n2",
    "documentation shall be completed not\nmore than 30 days prior to the start of\nemployment and every 12 months\nthereafter.\nOne out of two new hire records reviewed had completed a central registry form\nmore than 30 days prior to start of employment. The employee was hired on\n5/27/24 and the central registry was completed on 4/12/24.\nCCI Rule 400.4113 Employee records.\n• (1)An institution shall maintain employee\nrecords for each employee and shall include\ndocumentation of all of the following\ninformation prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule:\n• (j) A written evaluation of the\nemployee's performance within 30 days\nof the completion of the probationary\nperiod or within 180 days, whichever is\nless, and a written evaluation of the\nemployee's performance annually\nthereafter.\nOne out of five employee records reviewed did not have an up-to-date\nperformance evaluation completed. The employee's last performance evaluation\nwas completed on 1/31/24.\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n• (1) When a resident is discharged from\ninstitutional care, all of the following\ninformation shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n• (b) A brief summary or other\ndocumentation of the services\nprovided while in residence, including\nmedical and dental services.\nTwo out of two files did not have a brief summary of the services provided\nincluding medical and dental care.\n3",
    "CCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n• (1) When a resident is discharged from\ninstitutional care, all of the following\ninformation shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n• (c) An assessment of the resident's\nneeds that remain to be met.\nTwo out of two files did not have an assessment of the resident's needs that still\nneeded to be met.\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n• (1) When a resident is discharged from\ninstitutional care, all of the following\ninformation shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n• (d) Any services that will be provided\nby the facility after discharge.\nTwo out of two files did not have any services that would be provided by the facility\nafter discharge. There was a form that discussed after care services but nothing\nstating this would actually happen with the youth. One of the forms acknowledged\nthe youth declined services and the parent agreed to services, but no comment\nstating that aftercare or services would actually happen.\nCCI Rule 400.4166 Discharge plan\n• (1) When a resident is discharged from\ninstitutional care, all of the following\ninformation shall be documented in the case\nrecord within 14 days after discharge:\n• (e) A statement that the discharge plan\nrecommendations, including medical\nand dental follow up that is needed,\nhave been reviewed with the resident\nand with the parent and with the\nresponsible case manager.\n4",
    "Two out of two files did not have a statement that the discharge plan, including\nmedical and dental follow up was reviewed with the resident, or parent, or case\nmanager.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe agency was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Technical Assistance was provided for R.400.4108. There was discussion around\nensuring financial audits are initiated early enough so that they are completed\nwithin in an annual time frame. The agency is currently in the process of\ncompleting their financial audit. The last one completed was on 2/1/24.\n• Technical Assistance was provided for R. 400.4116. The facility had technical\nassistance from last year concerning R.400.4166. The agency did not take any\nsteps to address this issue, and it was not discussed in the Chief Administrator\nAssessment. Technical Assistance provided in the interim and renewal reports are\nto be discussed in the Chief Administrative Assessment. It is the chief\nadministrator’s responsibility to ensure compliance is met.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe agency was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• R.400.4116. There appears to be some disconnect between the Chief\nAdministrator and the staff at the facility. The staff at the facility felt a lack of\n“presence” from the chief administrator. The Chief Administrator notes that she\nhas been absent as of late due to health issues and due to running eight\nprograms. Weekly meetings will start back up with agendas so that the\ncommunication amongst administration and staff will continue. Consultation was\nprovided the meetings might want to have agendas and include audit findings and\nCAP achievement.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during the licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has not submitted any caps within the last review period.\nFinancial Overview\nI reviewed the financial audit completed on 2/1/24. There has not been an updated\none provided at this time, but they are in the process of completing it. The agency\nwill provide once it has been finished. There were no issues noted in review of the\n2024 budget.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\n5",
    "N/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nI reviewed the Chief Administrator Assessment. There was not a violation in the\n2024 Renewal. Technical Assistance and consultation were provided due to the\ndischarge summaries not being a fluid document and not having the document\nspecifically discussing the subsections of R.400.4166. Multiple documents had to\nbe reviewed to \"piece together\" compliance. Although this was technical assistance\n(TA) and the Chief Administrator Assessment does not speak specifically to TA, the\nagency did not correct this issue from last year resulting in violations this year. If TA\nis provided, the Chief Administrator Assessment should acknowledge the changes\nthey have made to stay in compliance in section noted as \"Continuous Monitoring\nPlan.\"\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff were interviewed and there were no concerns noted for programing with the\nchildren. However there does appear to be a disconnect in communication between\nadministration and staff. No youth were placed so youth interviews were not\nconducted.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is well maintained and has a home setting. The home is inviting and\nclean in all areas. The school/recreation area is decorative and has multiple\nrecreational items for youth to engage in.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n6",
