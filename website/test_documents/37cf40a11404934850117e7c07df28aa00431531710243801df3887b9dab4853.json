INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Mental health service recommendations for Youth A provided to\nthe facility during a visit to the hospital on 07/14/2024 were not\nfollowed.\nInvestigation The Complainant was interviewed over the phone on 09/04/2024\nand provided no further information.\nYouth A was interviewed on 07/30/2024 during an unannounced,\nface-to-face visit to the facility. He recalled several instances of\ngoing to the hospital to receive outside medical treatment within\nthe past month. Youth A stated he believed Staff 1 and Staff 2\nhad taken him to the hospital on the date in question. This need\nfor medical attention was to address previous self-inflicted wounds\non Youth A’s forearm that he picked at and opened. Youth A\nbelieved the hospital had recommended he stay and be admitted\nfor longer term care. Youth A believed that is what he needed\nbecause he had felt suicidal, but could not specify if that was what\nwas occurring on 07/14/2024. Youth A could not recall exactly\nwhy he was taken from the hospital at that time. He did recall\ncoming back to the facility and then going back to the hospital a\nfew hours later, when he was released back to the facility again.\nNurse 1 was interviewed over the phone on 09/04/2024. Nurse 1\nwas not employed or affiliated with the facility, she stated she\nworked at the hospital that provided care for Youth A on\n07/14/2024. She stated she did not meet Youth A during this visit\nbut was able to provide additional information regarding his visit\nthrough hospital documentation. Nurse 1 reported Youth A was\ninitially triaged for care for his arm and once that was completed,\nhe spoke with social work staff at the hospital. She was not able\nto identify who that was from internal documentation. When he\nfirst arrived at the hospital, Youth A was asked if he felt suicidal,\n2",
    "and he stated “somewhat” but that he did not have any plans.\nShe stated that notes in the hospital’s medical documentation\nsystem stated Youth A was to then complete a psychiatric\nassessment, but also other notes stated that was not the case and\nhe would be recommended for discharge. Nurse 1 stated Youth A\nwas brought back into the hospital a few hours later after being\ncalled and requested to do so by hospital staff and then received\nan assessment to determine the need for inpatient psychiatric\ncare. Nurse 1 stated this assessment recommended continued\noutpatient services and Youth A was then discharged.\nStaff 1 was interviewed over the phone on 09/05/2024. He\nrecalled being with Youth A at the hospital on the afternoon in\nquestion. Staff 1 stated he was told by the front desk that Youth A\nwas ready for discharge after his arm was treated and Youth A\nspoke with a hospital social worker. He recalled discussion of a\npsychiatric evaluation, but confirmed with nursing staff at the front\ndesk that was not going to occur at this time and Youth A would\nbe discharged. Staff 1 could not recall Youth A saying anything\nthat gave him concern for his mental well being. Staff 1 could not\nrecall any of the nursing staff names. He stated he was trained on\nthese “hospital runs” to ensure leaving with documentation of the\nyouth’s medical treatment to bring back to the facility. Staff 1\nrecalled taking documentation back to the facility, but he could not\nrecall any specifics on what that documentation contained.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 09/10/2024. Staff 2\nrecalled taking Youth A to the hospital with Staff 1 on the date in\nquestion. Staff 2 believed the original reason for the hospital trip\nwas to ensure that Youth A’s arm was able to receive treatment\nfor self-induced injuries to his forearm. She recalled discussions\nabout Youth A receiving a mental health evaluation after his arm\nwas treated but did not believe she ever heard Youth A say\nanything that was of concern regarding self harm or suicidal\nideations on that day. Staff 2 recalled Youth A was moved rooms\nand hospital staff stated numerous times this occurred because\nthey were getting him ready to be discharged. Staff 2 believed it\nwas a nurse at the front desk that eventually instructed them to\nleave and Youth A was discharged.\nStaff 3 was interviewed over the phone on 09/05/2024. Staff 3\nrecalled taking Youth A back to the hospital later in the evening on\nthe date in question. He was told to do so by a supervisor. Staff 3\nstated this trip to the hospital was for the purpose of having Youth\nA participate in a psychiatric evaluation performed by hospital\nstaff. Staff 3 recalled Youth A participated in the evaluation, and it\n3",
    "was recommended he be discharged and continue to receive\noutpatient services at the facility. Staff 3 recalled Youth A did not\ndisclose during the evaluation that he ever intended to harm\nhimself further than he had on his arm prior and felt safe at the\nfacility. Staff 3 stated the hospital then discharged Youth A and\nthey returned to the facility without issue.\nYouth A’s DHHS Foster Care Worker was interviewed over the\nphone on 09/05/2024. She recalled the date in question where\nYouth A had been taken to the hospital to receive treatment for\nself induced wounds to his arm, and then return for psychiatric\nevaluation. DHHS Foster Care Worker stated Youth A had been\ntransported to the hospital frequently prior to and after that\n07/14/2024 for other incidents of attempted self harm and\nexpressions of desire for further self harm. She stated she had\nnot had any concern about the facility’s response to Youth A’s\nneeds at that point. DHHS Foster Care Worker recalled the date\nin question because it occurred on a Sunday, and she received\ndocumentation the next day and had a voicemail left for her the\nprevious day after staff arrived at the hospital with Youth A.\nDHHS Foster Care Worker recalled Youth A being admitted to the\nhospital on a separate day later in the week and that was the first\ntime since his placement at the facility that he had been screened\nthrough a psychiatric assessment at the hospital and\nrecommended for inpatient treatment.\nDocumentation reviewed:\n• Incident Report documentation from the facility dated\n07/14/2024. In this documentation it was described that\nYouth A was transported to the hospital to receive medical\ntreatment because he had removed bandages to his arm,\ncausing previous wounds to reopen. It stated that staff and\nYouth A left for the hospital at 11:29 am and returned to the\nfacility at 4:39 pm.\n• Discharge Instruction documentation from Children’s\nHospital of Michigan for Youth A. This was dated\n07/14/2024 and 07/15/2024 and contained information\nabout the first visit and medical care provided to Youth A’s\narm, as well as the second visit on the same day and\nevaluation completed with a recommendation of continued\noutpatient services.\n• Facility policy titled “Emergency Medical Services” was\nprovided and reviewed. It stated that “All requested\ndocumentation on the emergency medical situation should\nbe completed and forwarded to the Center Director”\nreferencing internal documentation for the facility.\n4",
    "Analysis The agency is found in compliance as per youth and staff\ninterviews and documentation reviewed. There was not evidence\nfound that showed that Youth A did not receive proper and timely\nmedical care.\nTechnical Assistance provided:\n• The facility was advised to ensure staff are instructed to not\nleave a hospital setting without documentation of a\ndischarge, and that they read the documentation provided\nto them prior to leaving to reduce the chance of any\nconfusion on medical recommendations.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n10/08/2024\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/23/2024\n___________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
