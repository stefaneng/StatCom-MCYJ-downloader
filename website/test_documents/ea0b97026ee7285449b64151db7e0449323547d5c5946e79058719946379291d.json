One\nCAP was approved on 3/24/22 as a result of the 3/4/22 renewal evaluation. The\nagency reported successful implementation of their CAP during this past year.\nStaff reported the CAP as something that is frequently discussed and reviewed\nwith everyone. During this review it was determined the agency significantly\ndecreased the number of violations found. The few citations noted in this\nevaluation were not repeat violations and the agency has identified the issue that\ncaused the violation. Overall, the agency has demonstrated successful CAP\nimplementation and compliance improvement.\nChief Administrator Assessment\n4",
    "The Chief Administrator Assessment was reviewed and discussed with the\nagency. The CAA identified several actions that were taken to implement the CAP\nfrom the 2022 renewal review. Overall, the agency reported the steps have been\nsuccessful. Staffing has been stable, which has also assisted in maintaining\ncompliance. The CAA reported one struggle over this past year with finding and\nmaintaining placements for children. Several disrupted placements have occurred\nin the past year. Some changes occurred for positive reasons such as sibling\nreunification or adoption. However, the majority of placement changes were due to\nfoster parent request. The agency identified the likely cause is related to having\nlimited placement options when the child first came into care. Meaning the initial\nplacement may not be the best fit, resulting in placement change later.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nTwo staff interviews were completed. Both staff reported being satisfied with their\nsupervisor, co-workers, and the agency overall. One employee noted they\nspecifically came to this office to work with their now supervisor. The employee\nstated the supervisor is competent, confident, knowledgeable, helpful and\ncompassionate, which makes a tremendous difference in employee satisfaction. It\nwas noted there was some morale issues during the past two years, which the\nstaff believe the Chief Administrator did an excellent job of addressing head on.\nThe CA scheduled meetings with everyone to problem solve and a staff advocacy\nteam was developed to give staff an avenue to address any concerns.\nNeither of the staff reported any ongoing concerns or areas that need\nimprovement.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in an office building in the city of Hillsdale. The building is\nsufficient for file storage, staff activities, and has visitation space for families. No\nconcerns were found.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\n5",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_ _____________April 27, 2023________________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 27, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
