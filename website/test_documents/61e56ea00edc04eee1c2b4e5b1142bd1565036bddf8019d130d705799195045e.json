The facility is in compliance with all applicable rules and statutes except for the\nfollowing:\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the\nfollowing information prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule:\n(i) Documentation from the Michigan department of\nhuman services, the equivalent state or Canadian\nprovincial agency, or equivalent agency in the\ncountry where the person usually resides, that the\nperson has not been determined to be a\nperpetrator of child abuse or child neglect. The\ndocumentation shall be completed not more than\n30 days prior to the start of employment and every\n12 months thereafter.\nOne of 26 new employees did not have verification that she had\nnot been determined to be a perpetrator of abuse or neglect in\nPennsylvania prior to being hired. This is a social service\nsupervisor. A clearance from Pennsylvania has been\nrequested. The social service worker is in training and will not\nhave any contact with children until the agency receives the\nclearance.\nR 400.4113 Employee records.\nAn institution shall maintain employee records for each\nemployee and shall include documentation of all of the\nfollowing information prior to employment or at the time\nspecified in this rule:\n(j) A written evaluation of the employee's performance\nwithin 30 days of the completion of the probationary period\nor within 180 days, whichever is less, and a written\nevaluation of the employee’s performance annually\nthereafter.\nTwo of 26 new employees did not have a performance\nevaluation within a probationary period.\n4",
    "R 400.4152 Initial documentation.\nAt the time of admission, all of the following shall be in the\nresident's case record:\n(a) – (j)\nFor three of six residents, this documentation was not in the\nrecord at the time of admission.\nR 400.4156 Institutions not detention institutions or shelter care\ninstitutions; updated treatment plan.\n(1) The social service worker shall complete, sign, and\ndate an updated treatment plan for each resident at\nleast once every 90-calendar days following the\ninitial treatment plan.\nOne of 11 UTPs was completed 23 days late.\n2.) The facility is in compliance will all additional ISEP requirements.\n3.) The facility is in compliance will all DDHS Contract/Policy requirements.\nIV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered much of the same consultation that was given in 2019:\nThe DHHS ITP and UTP templates should not be reformatted or altered by adding\ncharts or spread sheets.\nDates of signatures should be handwritten on signature pages.\nSummarize the positive and overall behaviors of the child as well as those behavioral\ntrends/situations that rose to the level of an unusual incident. Incident reports should\nnot be transcribed and listed in the treatment plans.\nThere is no need to repeat the treatment/service provisions of the program in more\nthan one area of the report.\nThe progress toward goal achievement section on treatment plans only relates to the\ntime frame identified on the report.\n5",
    "Contacts should not be copied and pasted from Outlook or the agency’s own software\nsystem into the social work contacts section of reports. Each contact should include\nthe date, type of contact (face-to-face, phone, email), parties involved with official\ntitle/agency and the reason for contact.\nIndividual, group and/or occupational therapy sessions should not be listed in the\nsocial work contacts section of reports. Therapeutic services is a provision of the\noverall treatment program. Therapy case notes should be maintained separately and\nbe available upon request.\nEVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nMethodist Children’s Home submitted five corrective action plans resulting from DCWL\nspecial investigations. Four CAP’s were submitted and implemented related to the staff\nnot following the agency’s policies and procedures. The following policies were\nreviewed, discussed and monitored with the staff: dispensing medication, child\nsupervision, staff in resident bedrooms, child discipline and mandated reporting.\nIdentified staff received disciplinary action for failing to adhere to agency policies. One\nviolation was established for failing to update a treatment plan with regard to visitation.\nA corrective action plan was implemented that included updating visitation rosters; the\nvisitation policy was also reviewed with both direct care and clinical staff.\nV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nrules and statutes. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended the facility will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\nMarch 14, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 17, 2020\n________________________________________\nLinda D.
