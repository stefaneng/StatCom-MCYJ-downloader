EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were 2 substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod. Both instances were from separate investigations that resulted in confirmed",
    "cases for two former staff members. Each incident that caused the investigations\ninvolved staff members performing restraints in manners that were not supported\nby training in the facility’s approved restraint model.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 3 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\ninspection completed on 01/05/2023 contained four rule violation findings. A\ncorrective action plan was submitted and approved on 02/09/2023. No citations\nfrom the interim inspection in 2022 were cited as repeat citations in this renewal\ninspection.\nThe facility has submitted two other acceptable corrective action plans (CAPs)\nduring this licensing period as a result of special investigations, and compliance\nwith CAPs are as follows: The CAPs addressed improper restraint techniques by\nimplementing further training, clarifying expectations with staff and supervision,\nimplementing enhanced restraint review processes, coaching with staff on de-\nescalation techniques as well as monitoring their own self-awareness and possible\ntriggers. Ongoing CAP monitoring is conducted with the facility, and they are\ncomplying with the CAPs at this time.\nFinancial Overview\nYearly budgeting and auditing for the facility was provided by the overseeing\norganization and no concerns were noted.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nN/A\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator Annual Assessment was received and reviewed in November\n2023. The facility assessed their Corrective Action Plans from the last inspection\nas well as two Licensing Special Investigations during the course of this past year.\nefforts made to continuously monitor ongoing compliance include a clearly defined\norganizational structure, clear and concise policies and procedures as well as\nactive supervision of all staff.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff were interviewed during an announced on-site inspection on 11/03/2023.\nThey all reported satisfaction working with the youth and at the program.\nManagement and administration were described as involved and aware of issues\npresented to them. Feedback was received on the recent changes in restraint and\nseclusion policies at the facility.\nYouth were interviewed during an announced on-site inspection on 11/03/2023.\nAll youth reported feeling safe and cared for at the facility.

    "helping to create positive change in some youth placed at the facility.

The building was in good repair and clean. Units were viewed and the\nbedrooms, bathrooms and other living spaces were in good repair. Construction\nwas occurring at the time because of another program being opened within the\nsame building, but there were no safety or programming concerns present as a\nresult.\nA variance was requested on 12/01/2023 because the facility received a Fire\nInspection report from the Qualified Fire Inspector dated 10/16/2023 with an \"A\"\nrating, but this was based off of the Court Operated rules instead of the Child\nCaring Institution rules in which the facility is licensed. The necessary inspection\nby the Qualified Fire Inspector was completed prior to the license expiration for the\nfacility on 12/09/2023. A variance was approved on 12/1/23 to allow the agency to\ncome into compliance and receive an A rating for fire rules for Child Caring\nInstitutions by 12/31/23.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n12/01/2023\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 1, 2023\n_________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager"
