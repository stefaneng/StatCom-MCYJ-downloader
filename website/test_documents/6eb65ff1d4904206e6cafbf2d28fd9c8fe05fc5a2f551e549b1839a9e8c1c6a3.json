    "There were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency renewal inspection was completed on 6/11/2024 and the CAP was\napproved on 8/7/2024. The agency was cited for 11 violations, none of which were\nrepeated this year. In 2023, 10 violations were established, none of which were\nrepeated this year.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was reviewed. The chief administrator\nindicated the previous year CAP had a positive impact overall. There has been a\nnoticeable improvement in quality contacts and successful completion of licensing\ntasks. The assessment noted some barriers including a lack of available medical\nand dental care. In addition, some contacts were missed due to circumstances\noutside of staff control, such as frequent rescheduling and parents avoiding\nworkers. The agency has experienced a significant amount of change during the\nreview period, specifically a reconfiguration of county structures which has led to\nchanges in worker roles and case assignments.\nFinancial Overview\nN/A\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nThree staff were interviewed face-to-face at the agency. Staff expressed the\ntransition with office realignment has been somewhat challenging at times, but\nthey feel everyone worked together to do their part. No concerns were reported.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing services. All files were stored securely and\nthere is a cross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert #1: The relative home was found to lack a carbon monoxide\ndetector.\nResolution: A carbon monoxide detector was provided to caregiver by licensing\nworker. It was installed while staff was onsite and verified to be in working\n3",
    "condition. Two pictures showing the installed carbon monoxide detector were\nprovided as verification.\nSafety Alert #2: A licensed foster home had a foster child sleeping in the\nbasement living room which has not been assessed as a bedroom in the home.\nResolution: The child was moved to an upstairs bedroom that meets licensing\nrequirements. A variance was submitted to DCWL in case the licensed foster\nhome would like to use that space as a bedroom in the future. After discussion\nbetween the agency and licensed foster home it was decided to withdraw the\nvariance as the sleeping arrangements are now in compliance with licensing\nrules.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n__________7/11/2025_______________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 11, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
