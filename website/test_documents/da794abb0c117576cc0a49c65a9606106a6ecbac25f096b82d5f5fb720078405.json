    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection • (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family\nDescription time for each child in foster care consistent with the child's\nservice plans, as required by R 400.12419 and R\n400.12420 to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation There are concerns that the agency is not following parenting time\nprotocols regarding a specific foster care case.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nParent A - On 4/18/2024 Parent A was interviewed by phone. Her\nfiancé, Parent B, could also be heard talking and answering\nquestions in the background. Parent A stated she believes Foster\nCare Worker is not allowing required visitation. Parent A reported\nshe and her Parent B were visiting their 5 oldest children twice per\nweek until Foster Care Worker had the Judge order the visits to be\nreduced to once per week. Parent A stated she and Parent B are\nstill able to visit their infant son 3 times per week. Parent A stated\nthe court ordered the parents arrive one hour prior to every visit\nand if she is a few minutes late, Foster Care Worker will cancel\nthe visit. Parent A feels she should get a 15-minute grace period\nlike other families working with the agency. She reported that\nthere was one visit during which Parent B left to get pizza for the\nkids after which an agency supervisor would not allow him back\ninto the visit. Parent A stated her children were upset, so she told\nthem it will all be over soon. An agency supervisor then made\nParent A leave the visit due to talking with the children about the\ncase, despite Parent A stating she was referring to the current visit\nsituation, not the case. Parent A stated she has never missed a\nvisit unless it was cancelled due being a few minutes late. She\nadded that Foster Care Worker scheduled a well-child visit for her\ninfant right before parenting time with the other children, so to\nmake her parenting time, she had to leave the well child visit and\nmiss the administration of her infant’s vaccines.\nFoster Care Worker - On 4/18/2024 Foster Care Worker was\ninterviewed via video conferencing. She reported the court\nordered parenting times be reduced from twice per week to once\nper week with a requirement that the parents arrive 1 hour prior to\nthe visit. Foster Care Worker stated the early arrival time was\n2",
    "previously ordered to be 30 minutes, but the parents were\ncontinually arriving late causing the children to spend unnecessary\ntime in the car, so the time was increased. Since the increase, the\nparents have improved their compliance. She stated there have\nbeen times in the past when the parents called and stated they\nwould be 10 minutes late and the visit would still be allowed, but\nthe parents seemingly took advantage of that leniency by\nrepeatedly coming late, so Foster Care Worker has to be stricter.\nFoster Care Worker stated she recalled the incident when Parent\nB left to get pizza. Foster Care Worker reported she, the agency\ncase aide, and an agency supervisor all told him he would not be\nallowed back in if he left. She stated he signed an agency\nparenting time rules document at least once, which outlines that\nparents cannot leave and come back to visits. Parent B left\nanyway and was not allowed back into the visit. Parent A became\nupset and verbally aggressive with the workers and supervisor, so\nthe supervisor ended the visit.\nFoster Care Worker stated the foster parents both work and the\ninfant child’s medical appointments are typically scheduled after\nthey get home from work which is typically 4-4:30pm. On the date\nof the infant’s well child Parent A is referring to; the parents were\nallowed to arrive at the start of the 5:00pm parenting time with the\nother children rather than an hour early so they could attend the\nmedical appointment. The appointment ended up running long, so\nthe parents had to leave the appointment before the vaccines\nwere administered, as the other children were already at the office\nwaiting for their parents. Foster Care Worker stated she has since\nbeen more mindful of when medical appointments are scheduled\nso they don’t conflict with parenting time.\nFoster Care Supervisor – On 4/19/2024 Foster Care Supervisor\nwas interviewed via video conferencing. She reported being aware\nthat Parent A and Parent B are unhappy about the court orders\nregarding their visitation. They have requested meetings to talk\nabout parenting time with the worker and supervision twice;\nhowever, they did not show up to either meeting. Foster Care\nSupervisor stated the parents were previously ordered to arrive 30\nminutes prior to their scheduled visit, but they frequently arrived\nlate or not all, so the early arrival time was increased to one hour.\nAdditionally, based on the frequency of their missed visitation, the\ncourt reduced parenting time with the older children to one hour\nper week. When told the parents reported having never missed a\nvisit during their interview, Foster Care Supervisor replied that is\nnot true, indicating the most recently missed visit was before this\ninterview. She added they did attend parenting time with their\n3",
    "infant child twice earlier in the week, but they left both visits an\nhour early.\nDOCUMENT REVIEW\nThe following documents were reviewed in the electronic case\nrecord:\n• 5/23/2023 Court Order– Parents shall arrive 30 minutes\nearly to every visit\n• 10/24/2023 Court Order – Family is to arrive 1 hour prior to\nscheduled parenting time\n• 1/23/2024 Court Order - Parenting time reduced to 1 hour,\nmother to have no unsupervised contact with youths, all\nother orders remain\n• Parenting Time Ground Rules document signed by Parent\nA & Parent B on 4/17/2022 & 4/22/2023\n• Case Service Plan covering 12/1/2023-2/21/2024\n• 2/21/2024 Visitation Plan indicating supervised parenting\ntime is to occur once per week for one hour\nAnalysis The agency is found in compliance as staff are following the court\nordered parenting time requirements.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 30, 2024\n______________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMay 2, 2024\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n4"
