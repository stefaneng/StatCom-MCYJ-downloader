    "Youth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on\nDecember 6, 2023. Youth A reported two different staff, on\nseparate occasions, walked into her room to complete checks on\nYouth A without announcing themselves or knocking on the door.\nYouth A described being in the shower when Staff 2 entered her\nroom. Youth A stated it was the only time this occurred with Staff\n2 and is not aware of Staff 2 entering any other youths’ room\nwithout announcing herself or knocking on the door. Youth A\nstated she was in the shower with the water running but would\nhave heard Staff 2 announce herself and knock on the door.\nYouth A stated she had the door open, so she stuck her head out\naround the wall and yelled at Staff 2 for not knocking. Youth A\nstated Staff 2 told Youth A she knocked three or four times and,\nannounced herself. Youth A reported Staff 2 then walked back\nout of Youth A’s room. Youth A denied Staff 2 making any\ncomments that made her feel uncomfortable, lingering in Youth\nA’s room or touching Youth A. Youth A stated Staff 2 no longer\nworks at the facility.\nYouth A described Staff 1 walking into her room several times\nwithout announcing himself or knocking on the door. Youth A\nstated she filled out a recipient rights complaint because staff are\nnot supposed to do safety checks that way and it is an invasion of\nher privacy. Youth A described laying on her bed or being in the\nshower when Staff 1 has walked into her room. Youth A stated\nStaff 1 would look at her, sometimes say hi, then close the door.\nYouth A denied Staff 1 making any comments that made her feel\nuncomfortable, lingering in Youth A’s room or touching Youth A.\nYouth A stated Staff 1 now works in a different area of the facility.\nYouth B and Youth C were interviewed face to face at the\nfacility, separately on December 6, 2023. They both denied any\nstaff completing safety checks without announcing themselves\nand knocking on the door. Youth C reported she has been in the\nshower when she has heard staff knocking on the door. Youth C\nstated she just pokes her head out and staff do their check then\nclose the door. Youth B and Youth C stated staff must see your\nhead and neck when doing a safety check. Youth B reported staff\nmust enter the room even if youth do not respond to make sure\nthe youth is safe. Youth B and Youth C denied seeing Staff 1 or\nStaff 2 enter Youth A or any other youths’ room without\nannouncing themselves or knocking on the door.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via telephone on December 11, 2023.\nStaff 1 described knocking three times on Youth A’s door saying,\n“hey I’m doing a check,” and Youth A did not respond. Staff 1\n3",
    "stated he opened the door to do a head and neck check on Youth\nA and Youth A was fully clothed sitting in the shower area. Staff 1\nreported Youth A became mad Staff 1 was doing a check and\nasked for a female staff. Staff 1 stated after Youth A became\nupset Staff 1 asked for a female staff to complete the checks.\nStaff 1 denied completing checks on Youth A or any youth without\nannouncing himself or knocking on the door. Staff 1 reported he\ncould not recall ever seeing any staff enter a youth’s room without\nknocking or telling the youth a check was being done.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via telephone on December 11, 2023.\nStaff 2 denied ever completing unannounced checks on any youth\nwhile working at the facility. Staff 2 stated during training staff are\ntold they must complete checks even if a youth does not say\nanything to ensure the youth is safe in their room. Staff 2 denied\never seeing any staff enter a youths’ room without announcing\nthemselves or knocking.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Staff 1’s personnel file: There were two disciplinary actions\nfor attendance issues and Staff 1 completed training in\nJune and July of 2023.\n• Staff 2’s personnel file: There was no disciplinary record\nand Staff 2 completed training in May and June of 2023.\n• Recipient Rights Complaint form completed by Youth A\nregarding Staff 1: Complaint is Staff 1 violated Youth A’s\nprivacy by entering Youth A’s room when she is in the\nbathroom and laying down. Youth A requested for female\nstaff to complete checks. The complaint does not indicate\nStaff 1 entered the room without announcing himself or\nknocking.\n• Documented Discussion with Staff 1 by Manager dated\n12/11/23: Policy review and education done in regard to\nchecking on youth who are in the shower, especially if the\ngender is different.\n• Standard Operating Procedure: Lotus Program – Resident\nSafety Checks Policy: Policy states, “If the resident is in\ntheir bathroom/shower at the time the check is being\ncompleted: A staff of the same gender should knock on the\ndoor, indicate it is time for a check, and visually see the\nindividual. If a resident is in the shower, it would be\nsufficient to see just the head/neck of the resident and not\ntheir full body. It is NOT sufficient for the resident to simply\nsay they are okay – you must physically see at minimum\nthe resident’s head and neck.”\n4",
    "Analysis Although there were no findings that staff sexually abused Youth\nA or failed to knock on Youth A’s door when walking in on Youth\nA, the facility is found in noncompliance as the safety check\ncompleted on Youth A while she was in the shower was in\nviolation of the agency’s Resident Safety Checks Policy as the\npolicy requires a staff of the same gender to complete the required\ncheck.\nTechnical Assistance:\nIt is recommended the agency review the Resident Safety Checks\nPolicy to determine if updates should be made to allow a staff of\nthe opposite gender to complete checks on a youth in the shower\nwhen a same gender staff is not available. The agency should\nalso consider updating the policy to include number of times a\nstaff member should announced themselves and knock on a\nyouths’ door prior to entering to provide clarification for staff.\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n12/21/2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nBarbara A Cote Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 8, 2024\n______________________________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n5"
