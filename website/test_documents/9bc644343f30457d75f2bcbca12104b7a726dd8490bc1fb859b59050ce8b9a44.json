INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff responsibilities.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care. Social\nservice workers shall work directly with the children, their families,\nand other relevant individuals and be primarily responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation Back in March 2024 the agency had to retrieve the children from a\nrelative’s home after they were left home alone, and the police\nwere contacted. The agency could not obtain a clearance on\nanother relative who had come to the home to try to care for them\nuntil the caregiver arrived, so the children were taken to the\nagency for the night.\nThe children were sent to school by the agency staff the next day\nin too small and dirty clothing.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nComplainant: On 6/5/2024 I interviewed Complainant by\ntelephone. Complainant reported during a DHHS (Department of\nHealth and Human Services) audit of departmental reports, the\nissues as indicated in this complaint were observed in a report,\nwith the primary concern being that the children, Child A, Child B\nand Child C were sent to school by the agency with dirty, too small\nclothing, after they had spent the night at the agency.\n2",
    "Complainant reported per a DHHS report the agency staff took the\nchildren from the caregiver’s home after the caregiver had not\nreturned to the home from work. The children’s transport to the\nagency was also after the agency was unable to obtain a\nchildren’s services clearance on the children’s grandmother who\nhad arrived at the home and was not the approved substitute\ncaregiver. Complainant further reported it was reported by P2P\n(Pathway to Potential) Specialist that the children’s school\nprincipal told P2P Specialist the information that was reported\nabout the children’s clothing. Complainant reported the school\nprincipal would have direct information about what is alleged\nabout the children’s clothing.\nPathway to Potential Specialist: On 6/14/2024 I interviewed\nPathway to Potential (P2P) Specialist about the allegations by\ntelephone. P2P Specialist reported her position was via the state\nof Michigan whereby she was stationed at the school. She works\nindirectly with students looking at attendance issues, process cash\nassistance, and help children and families who may be homeless.\nShe said she was not at school on the day of the alleged incident.\nShe was told about the incident the next day. She was told the\nchildren were dropped off with McDonald’s breakfast. They came\ndisheveled with dirty clothes, and they appeared to not have\nshowered. The principal gave them clothes and a toothbrush and\nmay have given them shoes. P2P Specialist said she researched\nthe case, saw the children were assigned to Holy Cross and that\nthere was a DHHS investigation. P2P Specialist reported she may\nhave emailed the DHHS worker and left a message on Teams but\nshe was not certain. She said since DHHS was involved in the\nmatter she did not do anything further.\nPrincipal: On 6/14/2024 I interviewed Principal of School M. She\nverified that an agency staff transported Child A and Child B to\nschool, on a day in early March 2024. The worker advised them of\nthe situation for the children and had purchased McDonalds for\nthe children. Principal reported the children’s clothing were the\nsame as the day before, but they were not dirty or too small. She\nsaid the children’s appearance in regard to other children at the\nschool was fine and better than many. She said the school is\nequipped with dealing with varies situation like this and they\narranged for the children to get cleaned up, provided toothbrushes\nto them. Principal reported Child A’s shoes were too small, and\nthe agency worker offered to go purchased him shoes, but she\nadvised the worker the school had items for situations like this\none. The school gave Child A shoes. Child B was also given\nshoes “not because she needed them” Child B saw the shoes and\n3",
    "liked them. Principal reported the school had no fault with the\nagency’s handling of the situation.\nFoster Care Supervisor: On 6/26/2024 I interviewed Foster Care\nSupervisor (FCS) about the allegations by telephone. FCS\nconfirmed Child A’s, Child B’s and Child C’s case was supervised\nby the agency. She reported the agency received a call late in the\nevening one day in March of 2024 that the children’s relative\nCaregiver was not at home with the children. That Caregiver had\ngone out of state. Upon calling Caregiver and being unable to\nreach Caregiver, the agency conducted a safety check at the\nhome with the police. There was a support person, believed to be\nCaregiver’s mother, “Person X” with the children. The agency did\nnot know this person. The agency had no documented substitute\ncaregiver on file for/from Caregiver. Since they did not know\nPerson X, did not have clearance paperwork on file for Person X,\nthe agency contacted DHHS intake in an attempt to get Person X\ncleared, given the emergence of the situation. DHHS intake would\nnot complete the central registry clearance. DHHS intake reported\nsince the agency was requesting the clearance for a substitute\ncare provider, not a new placement for the children, the agency\nneeded to follow up and complete the central registry clearance\nthe next day. FCS reported given what was reported by DHHS\nintake, and that Caregiver still was not answering her phone, they\ntook the children to the agency. They attempted to locate an\nemergency placement for the children, while still trying to connect\nwith Caregiver to see when Caregiver might come for the children.\nFCS reported those calls were occurring around 10:00PM and\nonward, but they were not able to locate a foster home willing to\ntake the three children. Around midnight Caregiver called back to\nsay she would be at the agency by 2:00AM to pick up the children.\nCaregiver never arrived and never called back. The children\nspent the night at the agency supervised by FCS and Foster Care\nWorker (FCW). Caregiver picked the children up from school the\nnext day.\nFCS reported this was the first incident of this type or with\nCaregiver. Caregiver is not licensed but is now pursuing licensure.\nFCS said she and FCW transported the children to school the next\nday. FCS took Child C to school, and FCW took Child A and Child\nB. The agency purchased a McDonald’s breakfast for the children\nand advised the school about the children’s situation. FCS denied\nthe children’s clothing being too small or dirty, but reported their\nclothing was what they had worn the day before. She reported the\nagency did not have clothing at the agency that would\naccommodate the children, because their clothing closet primarily\n4",
    "had infant clothing. They had checked the clothing closet the night\nbefore for clothing and bedding.\nFoster Care Worker: On 6/27/2024 I interviewed FCW about the\nallegations by telephone. FCW reported the situation and chain of\nevents similar to the FCS. FCW clarified that they were notified of\nthe Caregiver not being at the home after 8:00PM. The children\nwere with Caregiver’s two older teen sons when the police arrived.\nFCW and FCS arrived at Caregiver’s home and Person X was on\nher way to the home. Additionally, at one point in the evening\nCaregiver reported she was not in Texas, was in Michigan, and\nwas unable to leave work timely because of the person she was\ncaring for. Caregiver wanted the agency to see if they could clear\nPerson X to be with the children.\nFCW reported the children spent the night at the agency’s office\nbecause the agency was unable to reach Caregiver about her\nreturn home to retrieve the children (despite numerous calls), or to\nobtain an after-hour central registry clearance on Person X, or to\nsecure a respite foster home for the children. She said the agency\ndid all they could related to trying to find a proper placement for\nthe children; they did not want to have to spend the night at the\noffice.\nFCW affirmed she and FCS purchased McDonald’s breakfasts for\nthe children and she took the older two children to school. She\nspoke with someone in the school’s office about the children’s\nsituation. The office was familiar with the children and did not\nexpress any concerns.\nFCW also said the children’s clothing were the ones they had on\nfrom the day before. She denied the children’s clothing being dirty,\ntoo small, or smelling. She acknowledged a change of clothing for\nthe children would have been best, if they could have done that.\nShe reported they did not have access to the children’s home to\nget them a change of clothing. They did not have clothing for the\nchildren in their clothing closet, or access to petty cash to\npurchase clothing. She said their primary concern that evening\nwas getting the children and making sure they were safe and the\nnext day ensuring they did not miss school.\nDocument Review\nChild A’s, Child B’s and Child C’s MISACWIS case record which\nshowed:\n• The children were placed in Caregiver’s home on 1/5/2023.\n5",
    "• The children were made temporary court wards on\n1/5/2023.\n• The children were returned to the parental home on\n7/12/2024.\n• A social work contact for 3/4/2024 that indicated:\no The incident similar to what FCW had reported when\nshe was interviewed.\no Another person, a male, had arrived at the home\nreporting he was taking the children so as to take them\nto school the next day, and the agency advised the\nofficers not to allow that person to take the children.\nThe FCW and FCS came and transported the children\nto the office.\no FCW attempted to call Caregiver at 12:30am. The\nCaregiver texted and said that she was driving as fast\nas she could to get back, but the Caregiver never\nshowed up, and FCW FCS spent the night at the office\nwith the children.\no Caregiver texted FCW at 6:15 AM reporting she got a\nflat tire on her way home from meeting with a client in\nTraverse City and that her friend was picking her up at\n9 AM\no The agency made a complaint to DHHS intake about\nthe situation.\nA DHHS report that showed:\n• An investigation conducted on 3/5/2024 indicated reports\nwere made that Caregiver left for Texas, leaving the\nchildren home alone. The children were seen in the home\non 3/04/2024 during a home visit completed by their\ncaseworker.\n• An email was received from P2P Specialist that stated she\nspoke with someone, and the school was concerned about\nthe children because they came to school on 3/6/2024 “with\ntoo small of clothing, and dirty” after spending the night at\nthe foster care office.\n• There were no reports the children were harmed as a result\nof being home alone.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documentation reviewed the evidence\ndoes not show a lack of work by the worker/agency with the\nchildren, their families, and other relevant individuals related to the\nservice plans for the children and their families. The agency\nsought to supervise the children.\nConsultation:\n6",
    "From a best practice standard, it could be beneficial to the agency\nto have hygiene items and older children clothing on hand for\nemergency situations.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\nAugust 9, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 21, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n7"
