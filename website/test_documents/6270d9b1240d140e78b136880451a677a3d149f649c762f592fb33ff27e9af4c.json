Youth A has a dime size bruise on her\nright elbow and a quarter size bruise on her right hip bone. No\nother details provided.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n8/31/23 in collaboration with MDHHS worker. She reported\nbeing aware of the allegations. Staff 1 reported to her that Staff 1\nheld her arm out to block Youth A when Youth A ran into Staff 1’s\narm causing Youth A to fall to the floor. Youth A had reported Staff\n1 pushed her, causing her to fall into her desk and on the floor.\nAdministrator 1 reported this incident occurred on Sunday, August\n27th. She believes the incident started when Staff 1 received a call\nfor assistance and attempted to keep Youth A from going after\nanother youth. Staff were attempting to keep Youth A separated\nfrom Youth B, Youth C, and Youth D because she was threatening\nthem and very dysregulated. There was no attempt to restrain\nYouth A, only to impede her attempts to get to Youth B, Youth C,\nand Youth D. She reported staff are trained to avoid physical\ncontact with youth and use verbal redirection to help defuse the\nsituation. She reported staff will use themselves as barriers to stop\nfights between youth to avoid restraints. She described the\n“stripped room” is an extra bedroom down a different hall with\nlimited items but does have a bed and bedding. The room is\nutilized at times for youth with active suicidal thoughts or to\nprovided space from others.\nYouth A was interviewed face to face at the facility on 8/31/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker.

Prior to the incident in the room,\nYouth A went down the hallway and stood in the doorway of Youth\nB, when Youth B threw a bottle and then a shoe at Youth A. Staff\n1 moved Youth A back to her room by using her body to direct\nYouth A. Once in her room Staff 1 and Staff 2 tried to restrain\nYouth A with both of the staff grabbing Youth A’s hands. Youth A\nwas able to get free and when attempting to rush the door, Staff 1\npushed Youth A with both hands to Youth A’s chest and Youth A\nfell backwards striking her elbow on either the wall or desk and\nstriking her hip on the desk. She showed a bruise on her right\nelbow and right hip. Youth A stated she pushed Staff 1 back and\nStaff 1 pushed her harder. This caused her to trip over her laundry\nbasket. Youth A reported having “blackouts” when angry and must\nhave blacked out because she doesn’t remember much more of\nthe incident. Youth A also reported not receiving any medical\ntreatment following the incident and even after she showed the\nmarks on her elbow to House Supervisor and Staff 2. Youth A\nreported feeling safe at times, but she must watch her back\nbecause other youth are “going to come after me”.\nYouth B was interviewed face to face at the facility on 9/5/23\nin collaboration with MDHHS worker.

She also reported being in her room across the hall from\nYouth A’s room at this time but “didn’t see what Staff 1, Staff 2,\nand Staff 4 were doing on top of Youth A in her room. She then\nreported being placed in the “stripped room” and was unable to\nsee or hearing anything that occurred in Youth A’s room. She then\nreported hearing what was occurring through the vent in her room\nand gaining information when she spoke with Youth A the next\nday. She reported hearing (through the vent) staff say they were\n3",
