    "There were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance:\nThe agency has submitted 2 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nSpecial investigation #2025SIC0000396 was initiated 2/14/2025, and the CAP was\napproved on 4/28/2025. The agency was found in noncompliance with licensing\nrule 400.12418 (5). This CAP is still in effect and not completed.\nThe agency submitted a CAP in response to the 2024 interim inspection. The\nreport was completed 9/6/2024 and the CAP was approved on 10/3/2024. The\nCAP addressed 4 violations. There was improvement with two of the violations\nthat were cited in the 2024 interim inspection. However, during this licensing\nperiod, 1 of the violations that were cited in the 2024 interim inspection and 1\nviolation in the special investigation report are repeats for this year indicating\nadditional corrective action planning is needed this year with the repeat violations.\nChief Administrator Assessment:\nThe Chief Administrator (CA) assessment identified areas of previously submitted\nand approved CAP that were not successful, such as special investigation,\ndevelopment of service plans and parent agency treatment plans. The CA\nidentified challenges with rule/policy compliance due to staff turnover, supervisors\ncarrying cases which neglected and impacted the opportunity for new workers to\ntransition into the agency. The CA explained when supervisors carried cases, staff\nweekly supervision did not always occur, and it was not consistent. She reported\nwhen supervisors were carrying cases, case management was being completed\nbut the information was not always documented correctly or timely. The CA\nreported the current corrective action plan has been used as a guide and for\ntracking. The CA reported the CAP is used in all of staff and individual team\nmeetings to keep the need before the staff and to address any ongoing concerns.\nShe said the division director reviews the CAP with strategies of improvement with\nthe managers at least monthly.\nFinancial Overview:\nThe agency’s certified independent auditor’s report dated September 30, 2024,\nand 2023 and the agency annual financial budget report was reviewed. There\nwere no financial concerns identified.\nStaff Interviews:\nThe staff interviewed feel supported by their coworkers, supervisors and\nmanagement. The staff discussed the impact of staff turnover and how it affects\ntheir day-to-day routine as more work is added to their already large caseloads.\nTheir supervisors, and coworkers are always there to assist if the need arises. The\nstaff reported some of the support with training is put in place, but they would like",
    "to see a stronger program applied to new workers when they return to the agency\nfrom attending the CWTI training.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through:\nThe agency has adequate space and equipment to perform required job duties.\nFiles are stored securely and in a manner that provides unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n6/23/2025\n_____________________________________________________________________\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n06/23/2025\n______________________________________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager"
