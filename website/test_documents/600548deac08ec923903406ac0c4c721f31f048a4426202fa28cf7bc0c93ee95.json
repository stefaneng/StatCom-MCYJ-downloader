Youth A described the incident in\nquestion beginning because he felt like he had energy in his body\nand he wanted to wrestle. Youth A recalled being in the\n“dodgeball room” of his unit, which he described as a recreation\narea with couches and a television. Youth A was on one side of\nthe door exiting this room, and Staff 1 was on the other. He felt\nlike Staff 1 was blocking him from being able to exit the\nroom. Youth A recalled the door opening and Staff 1 pushing him\nin the chest. Youth A believed that this push had enough force to\ncause him to fall over. Youth A remembered feeling angry, and he\nbelieved he stood up to try to punch Staff 1. He recalled Staff 1\nstating “Don’t do that” to him. Youth A recalled pushing back at\nStaff 1 and beginning to yell and curse at him. He recalled Staff 1\ncalling for a supervisor to come assist. Youth A remembered\nSupervisor 1 came and he mostly interacted with him and not Staff\n1 after that. Youth A recalled Staff 2 and Youth B also being in\nthe room when this occurred.\nStaff 2 was interviewed over the phone on 06/26/2025.

Staff 2 did not see either Youth A or Staff 1 put their hands\non the other from that point on.
