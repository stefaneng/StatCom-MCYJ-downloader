Staff 1 appears to move Youth A away\nfrom the group and toward the wall. Her arms are not observed on Youth A’s neck.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n Incident Report: Dated 5/25/22, written by Staff 1. The information provided in\nthe Incident Report was the same information provided in Staff 1’s interview.\n Staff 1’s file documentation indicated she was hired on 12/30/15. She did not\nhave any disciplinary action and her last restraint training was 9/29/21.\n Youth A’s Safety Plan: triggers for Youth A are the passing of his mother, not\nhaving access to Youth B, and being told no.\nDHHS did not have any findings.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(2) Resident restraint shall be performed in a manner that is\nsafe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity of the\nminor child’s behavior, chronological and developmental\nage, size, gender, physical condition, medical condition,\npsychiatric condition, and personal history, including any\nhistory of trauma, and done in a manner consistent with the\nresident’s treatment plan.\nANALYSIS: Based on the staff interviews and the video there is no indication\nthat Staff 1 choked Youth A while she was trying to restrain him.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nTwo youth, who are dating, were in a room together without any supervision.\nINVESTIGATION:\nWhile at the facility on 5/26/22 conducting an unannounced visit for the above\ninvestigation Youth A was observed siting on his bed with Youth B lying next to him\non the bed.

    "other staff she was leaving. PD stated the two youth were not supposed to be\nunsupervised. The PD stated the youth refused to leave the room.

He stated they should\nhave a staff sit in the doorway.\nDuring Youth A’s interview on 6/2/22 he reported that Youth B was in his bedroom\nwhen this consultant visited him. He said technically Youth B lives at the other house\nand they are not supposed to be in each other’s bedrooms. If they do not follow this\nrule the staff ask them to separate.

His negative\nbehaviors increased after the precautions were put in place. The precautions\nindicated Youth A and Youth B were not to be around each other. If the youth\nrefused to be separated staff had to be right there with them. The first precautions\nwere put in place on 4/20/22 and were recently updated to indicate they could not\nhave any contact. These precautions were documented on a form that was given to\nstaff. It was e-mailed to all staff and a copy was put on the clipboard that staff carry\nwith them. When the two youth have been in Youth A's bedroom the staff sit in the\ndoorway. They also encourage Youth B to return to her house. She has spoken to\nboth the youth to try to separate them. Today Youth B left Youth A's house.\nDuring Staff 1’s interview on 6/1/22 she stated when Youth A finally went to his room\non 5/25/22 Youth B went with him. Staff 1 sat right in the doorway.

If they\nrefuse to follow it then the staff supervise them the best they can. She has not seen\na time when Youth A and Youth B have been alone together. All the staff are aware\nof the plans.\nDuring Staff 3’s interview on 6/1/22, he reported Youth A and Youth B are not\nsupposed to have contact.

When he left Youth B and Youth C were in Youth A’s bedroom. The youth were\n7",
    "being supervised by staff. He reported staff are always watching Youth A and Youth\nB. Staff 3 admitted he was working on 5/26/22 when this consultant visited the\nhouse. He reported Staff 6 was supervising Youth A and Youth B when he came on\nshift at 2pm. She never told him when she left so he did not know they were not\nbeing supervised by anyone.\nVideo Reviewed:\nVideo from 5/26/22 at 2:51pm shows Staff 3 watching the previous staff who was\nwatching Youth A, leave the house. At 2:54pm Youth A and Youth B go into Youth\nA’s bedroom without a staff. The two of them come out then go back in. At 2:58pm\nStaff 3 is seen going down the hallway and leaning as if to look into Youth A’s\nbedroom then walks away. Staff 3 is seen in the hallway again but never goes near\nYouth A’s bedroom. This consultant and PD enter the doorway of Youth A’s\nbedroom at 3:23pm.

The facility also did not sufficiently address Youth B\nrefusing to leave Youth A’s bedroom. Additionally, the CA\nreported that Youth A was not on a safety plan when he was.\nThese factors indicate a lack of sufficient staffing to keep Youth\nA and Youth B safe and supervised.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2020C0223043; CAP approved 8/25/20\n8",
    "ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nStaff were viewed on video not completing checks.\nINVESTIGATION:\nVideo Reviewed:\nYouth A and Youth B were in Youth A’s bedroom unsupervised from 2:55pm to\n3:23pm. Staff 3 went down the hallway at 2:58pm. The next time a staff looked in on\nYouth A and Youth B was at 3:23pm when this consultant and the PD entered Youth\nA’s doorway.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4127 Staff-to-resident ratio.\n(4) When residents are asleep or otherwise outside of the direct\nsupervision of staff, staff shall perform variable interval, eye-on\nchecks of residents. The time between the variable interval\nchecks shall not exceed fifteen minutes.\nANALYSIS: The video showed staff not completing checks between 2:58pm\nand 3:23pm.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV.
