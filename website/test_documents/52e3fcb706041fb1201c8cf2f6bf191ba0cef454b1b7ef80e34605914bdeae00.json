Compliance\n06/22/2022 Contact, pre-exit with Chief Administrator.\nALLEGATION:\nFacility has not submitted records to MDHHS for permanent retention one year\nfollowing the final order of adoption as required. There are 3 records that have not\nbeen submitted.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 5/23/22 it was reported to DCWL that DHHS had not received three closed\nadoption files that were due in 2021. Contact occurred with the complainant to\ndetermine the names on the overdue files.\nChief Administrator (CA)\nOn 5/23/22 CA was contacted and notified of the investigation. On 5/31/22 an on-\nsite inspection occurred, and CA was interviewed regarding the files. CA reported\nthat during the COVID-19 pandemic local DHHS offices were refusing to accept\ncase files, as staff were not working in the DHHS office. Therefore, the agency held\non to several files from 2019-2022. CA reported the adoption supervisor tracks due\ndates for completed adoptions to be submitted to DHHS. The agency requires the\naccepting DHHS representative to sign a form, indicating which files they accepted.\nThe CA provided the following information for the identified files:\n File one: Due November 2021. Sent to DHHS 4/14/22.\n File two: Due December 2021. Sent to DHHS 5/27/22.\n File three: Due December 2021. Sent to DHHS 5/27/22.\n2",
    "In addition to these three files, CA reported that according to their records, there are\n21 adoption files from 2019-2022 that are overdue and need to be sent to DHHS.\nThe agency is in the process of packaging these files to submit to the local DHHS\noffices.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nADM 1030 Disposition of Records for MDHHS- Supervised Children\nFor both MDHHS and contracted adoption agency cases, the\nlocal MDHHS office or contracted agency must retain all\nadoption case records for one year after finalization of the\nadoption. One year (between 12-13 months) past the adoption\nfinalization date, a contracted adoption agency must send the\noriginal record to the local MDHHS office; copies must not be\nmaintained by the contracted adoption agency; see licensing\nrule R400.12713-Adoption Placement Record.\nANALYSIS: A violation was found due to multiple adoption files that were\nlate or remain overdue to DHHS.\nTechnical Assistance\nIt was discussed with the CA there was some confusion about\nfile retention dates and inclusion of the foster care file, when\nsending the adoption file to DHHS. Technical Assistance was\nprovided regarding FOM 722-15 as it conflicts with Rule 422(4)\nregarding file retention. DCWL confirmed that FOM 722-15 must\nbe followed.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n3",
