    "ALLEGATION:\nThere is an issue with the heat at this facility that has been present for a couple of\nweeks. The youth have to wear coats indoors due to temperatures of 54 degrees.\nThe owner is believed to be unwilling to pay for needed repairs.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis anonymous complaint was forwarded on 02/08/21 and was assigned for joint\ninvestigation with the DHHS Specialist. The initial allegations were as follows:\nThere are believed to be around 5 to 6 young women living at Let's Talk About It\nGirls Home. There is concern for all of the residents. It is very cold in the building\nbecause there is an unknown problem with the heat. This has been ongoing for\nat least a couple of weeks. The young women are having to wear coats in the\n/building due to the low temperatures of around 54 degrees. The owner is\nbelieved to be unwilling to pay for needed repairs. A few small space heaters\nwere purchased, however it is still very cold in the building.\nI conducted an unannounced onsite inspection of the facility on 02/08/21 after\nreceiving this complaint. This onsite inspection and interviews were completed jointly\nwith the DHHS Specialist. The Administrative Assistant was present and assisted\nwith a tour of the facility. The facility is a large three-story older home. Upon entering\nthe home, the temperature was observed to be cold. The main areas of the home on\nthe main level, including the kitchen, dining room, and living room were found to be\ncold. Some spots were warmer than others but overall, it felt cold on the main floor.\nThe thermometer for this level was located in the living room and was observed to\nbe 60 degrees when first observed and moved up to 61 degrees when the heat\ncame on. There was plastic covering most of the main floor windows and the\nAdministrative Assistant reported that to be relatively new. An electric portable space\nheating fireplace was in the living room and was on. The Administrative Assistant\nsaid that this was brought in over the previous weekend by the Chief Administrator.\nThere was a separate room with desks and another room that was being made into\na sensory room on the main floor. Those rooms felt warmer than the open main\nareas. The Administrative Assistant reported that the Chief Administrator had been\nin contact with a heating company who had done some maintenance and repairs to\nthe furnace and the ducts running through the home. The Administrative Assistant\nreported that the building had become colder with the recent colder weather and\nsome of the youth and staff had mentioned it. It was noted that the Administrative\nAssistant works Monday through Friday and staff over the weekend reported that it\nwas extremely cold in the building. The second floor was toured as well and was\nobserved to feel significantly warmer. The bedrooms are located on the second floor\nand we went into each room. Some were warmer than others but there were none\nthat seemed cold. The thermostat on the second floor read 74 degrees. There was a\nthird floor to the home, but the youth do not go on that floor.\n4",
    "Youths A, B, C and D were all individually interviewed jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist in the sensory room on the main floor. All youth reported that it has been\ncold in the building for several weeks and has recently gotten even colder. Some of\nthe youth reported wearing their coats inside, wearing layers, and needing blankets\nto keep warm. The youth said that the school room and the sensory rooms were\nwarmer when they kept the doors closed, but not all staff will let them keep the doors\nclosed. The youth said that staff did not make them shower in the main floor\nbathroom over the weekend due to it being so cold in the building. The youth\nreported that upstairs is warmer, and their bedrooms are warmer. The youth\nreported that the portable fireplace was brought in over the previous weekend to\nhelp with the heat. The youth further reported that staff have been boiling pots of\nwater on the stove and have had the oven on with the oven door open to help heat\nthe main floor.\nThe Chief Administrator (CA), the Chief Administrator in training, Quality Supervisor\nand the Director of Youth Services came to the building during the youth interviews.\nAfter meeting with the youth, the DHHS Specialist and I interviewed these\nadministrative staff jointly. The CA reported that they noticed it was “chilly” in the two\nmain rooms on the main floor, so they covered the windows with plastic. Per the CA,\nthis was the first winter in the building and they did not know that there was a\nheating issue. Reportedly, the building had been previously licensed but closed and\nsat empty for some time prior to the facility opening this program last spring. (I\nconfirmed in BITS that the program was licensed 03/18/20.) The CA stated that she\nhad a company making repairs to cracks in the ducts/vents and another looking at\nmaintenance on the furnace. The CA confirmed that she brought in the portable\nfireplace and was advised that this was not permitted under licensing rules. The CA\nagreed that it was cool in the building but reported that the thermostat was giving a\nfalse low reading due to the wall it is mounted on being cold. The CA was advised\nthat, if that were the issue then she needed to remedy the installation of the\nthermostat as that was what I needed to use, per the rule, to verify the temperature\nin the building. The CA further reported that they had moved a television into the\nsensory room so that the youth could watch television in the warmer room, rather\nthan in the front living room where it was notably colder. The CA was also advised\nthat staff are to immediately be advised that they are not to boil pots of water nor use\nthe open oven to heat the building. The CA indicated that she would direct them to\nstop immediately.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 02/08/21, at the facility, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 1 reported that it has been cold in the building and she is not sure what the\nissues are, but noted the CA was working to figure it out. Staff 1 said that she had\njust returned from being out of work for a couple of weeks and said that it was not\nthis cold inside before she left.\nI interviewed Staff 2 on 02/08/21, at the facility, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 2 reported that it has been cold in the building since it got colder (10-12\ndegrees) outside. Staff 2 said that it was just the kitchen and living room that were\n5",
    "cold and that the sensory room and school room were warm, as were the bedrooms\nand upstairs. Staff 2 said that she put up the plastic on the windows to help with the\nheat.\nI emailed all related DHHS Foster Care Workers for Youths A, B, C, and D. None of\nthe workers noted complaints by the youth related to the temperature of the building.\nAll of the workers reported that the building was not cold during their monthly visits.\nOne Foster Care Worker did report it was “cool but not uncomfortable” but went on\nto report that she likes the temperature set at 75 degrees. None had concerns\nrelated to safety or the heat.\nAdditional email and telephone contacts were made with the CA over the next few\ndays. The CA provided updates to her progress with the furnace company making\nrepairs and assessing for a new furnace. On 02/11/21, the CA called to advised she\nwas moving all of the residents to a Residence Inn due to the heating company\ninstalling a new furnace. This resolution fit with the facility’s emergency policy. The\nyouth would still be staffed and would all have their own bed. There is a kitchenette\nand dining table and chairs in the room.\nThe CA emailed on 02/13/21 and reported that the new furnace was installed, and\nthe temperature had reached 69 degrees. A picture of the thermostat was provided\nfor verification.\nOn 02/16/21, Consultant 2 made an unannounced onsite visit to the facility and\nadvised that the temperature was observed to be 61 degrees on the main floor.\nConsultant 2 said that the dining area and front living room were still cold, but the\nkitchen area was warmer. Consultant 2 said that he spoke with the youth and they\nreported that it was warmer in the building and they were more comfortable.\nConsultant 2 reported that the portable fireplace was disabled but still in the living\nroom.\nOn 02/18/21, the CA emailed the following,\nWe are continuing to assess the heat issue. On Tuesday 2/16/2 I caulked the\nwindows in the front room and recovered them with plastic to keep air out and the\ntemperature rose up to 65 degrees and held steady there overnight. On\nWednesday morning 2/17/21 the furnace company came back out to balance the\nheats distribution through the registers. They pushed more heat towards the front\nroom. The heat is teetering back and forth between 68 degrees and 72 degrees.\nThe CA attached three pictures of the thermostat that read 68, 69, and 72 degrees.\nAnother email and accompanying picture of the thermostat was received at 8:00pm\non 02/18/21 and noted the temperature to be holding at 75 degrees. Another email\nwith a short video of the thermostat and surrounding area, was received from the CA\non 02/19/21, and documented the heat at 73 degrees which is above the required 68\ndegrees.\n6",
    "On 02/24/21, Consultant 2 made an onsite visit to the facility and advised that the\ntemperature was 76 degrees on the main floor.\nDocuments reviewed as part of this investigation include the following:\n Utility Failure Emergency, revised 01/10/21\n 02/12/21 email from the Chief Administrator to the furnace company related to\na 02/08/21 onsite by the company and their plans to continue working on the\nheating issue. In a follow up email, the CA said that the 60,000 BTU furnace\nwill be replaced by a larger furnace with 100,000 BTUs.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4431 Heating equipment.\n(1) Heating equipment shall be capable of maintaining a\ntemperature of not less than 68 degrees Fahrenheit at a\npoint 4 feet above the floor. An accurate thermometer shall\nbe provided.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as the temperature was\nobserved to be at 61 degrees on the main floor. The Chief\nAdministrator acknowledged that this was due largely to the\ninadequate furnace, which was replaced. A CAP is still required.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe facility was found to be using an electric heating device that is not permitted\nunder the rules. During an unannounced inspection to the facility on 02/08/21, I\nobserved that an electric space heater was being used in the living room to assist\nwith improving the heat in the house. The Chief Administrator was advised that this\ntype of heating device is not permitted under the licensing rules. The Chief\nAdministrator later reported that she confirmed this with the Qualified Fire Inspector\nwho also said they could not use the heater.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4552 Heating devices and flame producing devices.\n(4) Portable heaters and space heaters, including solid fuel\nheaters, are prohibited.\n7",
    "ANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as they were using a\nportable, electric fireplace space heater in the living room to\nassist with heating the area. The fireplace was disabled;\nhowever, a CAP is still required.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable and timely corrective action plan.\nMarch 18, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n8"
