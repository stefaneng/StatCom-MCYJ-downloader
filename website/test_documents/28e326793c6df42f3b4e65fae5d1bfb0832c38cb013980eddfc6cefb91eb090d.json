Youth B reported he was\n2",
    "placed at the facility from 2016-2019. Youth B reported he had a\nlot of issues and concerns while placed at the facility. He reported\nthe staff didn’t care, didn’t do their jobs, didn’t follow the rules, did\nwhatever they wanted. Youth B could not provide any staff\nmember’s names or specific situations as examples. Youth B\nreported he remembered Staff 1 because he had the most issues\nwith him. Youth B reported “Staff 1 was just problematic. He used\nto pick on me and the other kids a lot”. Youth B could not\nremember the names of other youth Staff 1 had problems with\nexcept Youth A. Youth B reported Youth A did a lot of bad things.\nYouth B reported Youth A made a lot of sexual allegations against\nstaff members by saying staff members touched his private parts.\nYouth B reported he isn’t sure he believes anything like that ever\nhappened because Youth A was always talking about sexual stuff.\nYouth B could not remember which staff members Youth A\nalleged sexually touched him. Youth B reported he was put into an\nall-brick time out room in the basement of the facility and was left\nin there for hours. He reported it happened to other youth too but\ncouldn’t provide any specifics.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 9/26/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 is no longer employed for the\nagency. Staff 1 reported he never made any sexual advances,\nhad inappropriate conversations or inappropriate contact with any\nyouth at the facility while he worked there.

PC reported\nwhen Youth A and Youth B resided at the facility, seclusion was\nallowed per CCI licensing rules. When youth were being unsafe,\nthey would go to a “time-out room”, which was small room with\ncement walls. When PC worked there, staff members were\ninstructed to help them calm down by standing in the doorway, but\nnot lock them in there by themselves for long periods of time. It\nwas used as a space to help youth calm down by getting them\n3",
    "away from the milieu and stimulation of the main area with other\nyouth around.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via phone on\n10/3/23. CA began working at the facility in 2018. CA reported the\nuse of the “time out room” began significantly decreasing after she\nbegan working there. CA reported if the door remained open in the\ntime-out room, it was considered a “calming space” and the youth\nvoluntarily stayed in the room while staff helped them process\ntheir emotions. CA reported if the door remained closed, it was\nconsidered seclusion, which could only be 10-15 minutes long at\nmost. After 10-15 minutes, staff members had to open the door to\nallow the youth to try to do better. CA reported the seclusion room\nwas more traumatic and caused youth to get angrier and more\naggressive, so it was used as a last resort. CA reported they only\nutilized it as a seclusion room if staff members had no other way\nto keep the youth or staff safe from serious injury.\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n• MDHHS complaints regarding Youth A were reviewed.\nBesides this complaint, there are no other complaints about\nYouth A being raped or assaulted by any staff members at\nthe facility.\n• Youth A’s chart: There was no documentation Youth A\nmade any complaints regarding inappropriate staff\ninteractions with him during the time Youth A was at the\nfacility.\n• Reviewed all of Youth A’s services plans completed during\nhis placement at the facility.

    "There is no evidence to support Youth A was sexually abused by\nany staff at the facility. Youth A would not provide further\ninformation besides he was sexually assaulted by Staff 1 and Staff\n1 denied having any sexual interactions with Youth A.\nWhen Youth A and Youth B were placed in the facility (2015-\n2019), there was a “time-out room” near the therapist offices. The\n“time-out room” was utilized for youth to voluntarily calm down or\nfor seclusions, which were both approved methods during the\ntimeframe the youth were placed.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4159 Resident Restraint\nSection (2) In the event a restraint occurs, it must be performed in a\nDescription manner that is safe, appropriate, and proportionate to the severity\nof the youth’s behavior, chronological and developmental age,\nsize, gender, physical condition, medical condition, psychiatric\ncondition, and personal history, including any history of trauma,\nand must be done in a manner consistent with the youth’s\ntreatment plan.\nNote: When Youth A and Youth B were placed at the facility, this\nis the rule that was ineffect.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Staff member kicked youth's feet from out under him during a\nrestraint resulting in youth hitting their face on the ground.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed by Courtesy MDHHS Worker 1 on\n9/19/23 regarding a complaint from Youth A about an out-of-\nstate facility. Consultant was not present for the interview as\nit was unrelated to 2023C0000693SI. However, during the\ninterview, Youth A disclosed additional information about\nD.A. Blodgett St. John’s.

Youth B reported staff\nmembers used to put him in restraints all the time for no reason,\nthey were long restraints, and he wasn’t even showing aggressive\nbehaviors prior to the restraints occurring. Youth B could not\nprovide any staff names or specific scenarios. Youth B reported\nthe restraints weren’t ever done right, so he got hurt, but no one\n5",
    "believed he was hurt. Youth B reported staff members (couldn’t\nprovide names) slammed youth on the ground, slammed youth\ninto walls, and “did everything wrong”.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 9/26/23 in conjunction\nwith MDHHS Worker. Staff 1 is no longer employed for the\nagency. Staff 1 reported he does not remember any youth being\ninjured while he was restraining them. Staff 1 reported he never\ncompleted any restraints using moves outside of what they were\ntaught in CPI. Staff 1 reported if there were ever any injuries\nduring any restraints at the facility, it was a big deal and there was\nan internal investigation completed along with an investigation\ncompleted by MDHHS and DCWL. Staff 1 reported there were\nnever any situations he was a part of or he saw involving a youth’s\nface being near the ground, or kicking a youth’s feet out from\nunder them.\nAttempts were made to interview Staff 2 via phone on 10/2/23\nand 10/4/23, but Staff 2 did not return contact. Staff 2 is no\nlonger employed for the agency.\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n• Reviewed all Special Investigation allegations and findings\nfor all special investigation reports completed for the facility\nbetween 7/1/16-12/31/19 due to allegations by Youth A and\nYouth B that staff conducted inappropriate restraints. The\nfindings are as follows:\no 2018C0208031 dated 4/3/18 alleges Youth A\nreceived bruises while being restrained by Staff 3.\nDuring interviews, Youth A reported he felt safe at\nthe facility and liked it at the facility. Youth A couldn't\nremember where he received the bruise and didn't\nhave any concerns. Video footage was reviewed &\nrestraint was conducted appropriately. No violation\nestablished.\no SI 2017C0208056 dated 10/16/17 alleges Youth B\nwas inappropriately restrained causing injury to his\nshoulder. The violation was established because\nStaff 4 restrained Youth B when he shouldn’t have.\nHowever, the restraint was done properly, and SIR\nnotes injury was likely due to Youth B kicking his\nlegs up and twisting his body to free himself. A CAP\nwas approved on 10/20/17.\no SI 2018C0103036 dated 8/30/18 alleges Youth B\nwas inappropriately touched by Staff 5 during a\nrestraint. No violation was established.\n6",
    "o SI 2018C0103045 dated 12/26/18 alleges Staff 6\nimproperly restrained Youth B and made\ninappropriate comments to him. In Youth B’s\ninterview, he said there was nothing he liked about\nthe facility, he felt unsafe, but couldn't or wouldn't\ngive further details. A violation was established\nregarding Staff 6 making inappropriate comments,\nbut not regarding conducting an improper restraint.\no SI 2019C0103027 dated 7/15/19 alleges Staff 7\nridiculed and unwarrantedly restrained Youth B.\nViolation was established and a CAP was approved\non 8/30/19.\n• On 10/3/23, CA reported they no longer have Staff 1’s\nemployee file due to the length of time since he worked\nthere.\nAnalysis Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, this\nviolation is not established. Youth A provided minimal details\nabout Staff 1 conducting an improper restraint and Youth B did not\nprovide specific details about circumstances and/or staff involved\nin improper restraints. Therefore, based on Consultant’s review of\nall SIRs completed from 7/1/16-12/31/19, it is determined these\nconcerns were previously addressed. Staff 1 reported he\ncompleted all restraints per his training. He reported if restraints at\nthe facility were ever done improperly or youth received injuries\nduring restraints, it was a big deal, and they were investigated by\nMDHHS and DCWL.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings, the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended to continue the current licensing\nstatus.\nOctober 4, 2023\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 5, 2023\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n7"
