A service plan dated October 11, 2019 was not signed\nby the parent until November 27, 2019\n3.) Any violation listed in section 1 is also a DHS Contract violation.

Additionally, the PATP\ndetails the services and activities provided by the foster\ncare worker to assist the foster parent/caregiver in caring\nfor the child.\n4",
    "Four files and 13 service plans were reviewed. One of 4 files contained a PATP\ndated January 9, 2020 that was not signed until February 26, 2020. The signatures\nwere late. This is a second repeat violation. The original violation was established\nduring the Interim Inspection completed on January 11, 2019 and an acceptable\nCAP was received on February 11, 2019. A repeat violation was established during\nthe renewal inspection completed on September 23, 2019 and an acceptable\ncorrective action plan was received on October 22, 2019.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nTechnical assistance was not required at this time.\nV. CONSULTATION\nConsultation was not requested or offered at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period on October 22, 2019 in response to those\nviolations established during the renewal inspection completed on September 23,\n20219. There is one repeat violation noted from that inspection. Therefore, the\nagency will need to assess why the prior CAP failed to achieve compliance in that\narea.\nThere were no complaints against the agency during the licensing period and\ntherefore no special investigations were initiated.\n5",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility\ncontinue on a regular license.\nNovember 18, 2020\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 23, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
