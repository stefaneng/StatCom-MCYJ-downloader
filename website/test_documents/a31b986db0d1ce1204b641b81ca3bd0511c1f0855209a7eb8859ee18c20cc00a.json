    "ALLEGATION:\nIt was alleged that a minor visitor slipped a pair of crafting scissors to a resident\nduring a supervised visit at the facility. The scissors were later found in the\nresident's community bathroom on the unit.\nINVESTIGATION:\nResident E, age 17, is an MCI ward. She was removed from her biological parents as\nan infant and adopted together with her three siblings. At age 13, Resident E was\nremoved from her adoptive mother’s care due to abuse/neglect. She was placed with\nher biological aunt in Texas and then removed for assaulting the aunt. Resident E was\nplaced on probation in the home of her adult sister, age 26. Three months ago, she\nsaid she was removed from her sister’s care for “skipping school” and placed at Vista\nMaria. On 1/6/20, Resident E’s adult sister threatened to harm Vista Maria staff and\nwas taken off of her visitor list. At the time of this incident, Adult Visitor 1 was the only\nperson on Resident E’s visitor list. On the list, Adult Visitor 1 is identified as an “aunt”\nwho requires “supervised” visits.\nResident E was interviewed regarding the incident that occurred on 1/11/20. She\nclarified that she and Adult Visitor 1 are not blood relatives. Adult Visitor 1 is actually\nher sister’s boyfriend’s sister, but Resident E just refers to her as “aunt.”\nOn 1/11/20, Resident E said she had five visitors at Vista Maria. She listed Adult Visitor\n1; Child Visitor 2, age 14; Child Visitor 3, age 9; Child Visitor 4, age 5; and Child Visitor\n5, age 2. Resident E referred to the 14-year-old as Adult Visitor 1’s daughter. She said\nthe three younger children are her own biological nieces and nephew.\nI obtained Resident E’s visitor log. For the visit that took place on 1/11/20, Adult Visitor\n1 was the only name signed in on the log. The name of the staff or supervisor who\nsigned her in was left blank. I obtained Resident E’s approved visitor list. There were\nno Child Visitors on the list.\nI asked Resident E about what happened during the visit on 1/11/20. She said Staff 1\nsupervised it by sitting inside of the visiting room the entire time. As the visitors were\nleaving the building, Adult Visitor 1 stopped at the staff office. At that point, Resident E\nsaid Child Visitor 2 took crafting scissors from her pocket and handed them to her.\nResident E tucked the scissors into the waist of her pants. I asked if Resident E and\nChild Visitor 2 had preplanned this exchange. She said they did not.\nBefore returning to the wing, Resident E said Staff 1 “checked her in” by popping the\nback of her bra, having her pull the front of her own bra and empty her pants pockets,\nwhich is the normal “check-in” process. Staff 1 did not see the scissors tucked in her\npants.\n3",
    "I asked Resident E what she did with the scissors. Initially she said she hid them in her\nroom under her pillow. Then she put them back in her pants and hid them inside of the\nsink in the community bathroom. “I told a peer I had it…Staff found it.”\nAfter the scissors were located by staff, Vista Maria contacted the Dearborn Heights\nPolice Department to report the incident. Resident E provided a written statement to the\npolice.\nStaff 1 was interviewed with the facility Rights Advisor present. She has worked at the\nfacility for 16 months. When Resident E’s visit began, Staff 1 said Team Leader 1 was\non duty. Staff 1 volunteered to supervise the visit. During the visit, she said Child\nVisitor 2 “gave me a snarky look and appeared older than age 14.” She heard Adult\nVisitor 1 remark that Child Visitor 2 may someday “end up at Vista Maria.”\nWhen visiting time ended, Staff 1 said she exited the room behind Resident E. Adult\nVisitor 1 waited at the staff office for her purse and the Child Visitors hugged Resident E\ngoodbye in the hallway. The visit spanned across two shifts. Staff 1 said she did not\nknow which supervisor allowed the visitors into the building or visiting room.\nVista Maria’s visiting policy indicates the supervisor or designee:\n1. Checks visiting plan to ensure visitor is on approved list.\n2. Verifies visitor identification.\n3. Asks visitor to sign Visitor Log form (#732) and ensures no unnecessary or\ncontraband items are brought into the visiting area.\n4. If all conditions are met, shows visitor to a private visiting area and informs client of\nvisitor’s arrival.\n5. Before visit, checks client and area to ensure no inappropriate materials are present.\n6. Monitors length of visit.\n7. After visit, checks client and area to ensure no inappropriate materials are present.\n8. Signs all visitors out from unit on Visitor Log.\n9. Designates an assigned staff if needed for a supervised visit.\nThe staff person assigned to supervise the visit:\n1. Sits in visiting area to effectively monitor the physical and verbal interactions between\nthe resident and visitors.\n2. Documents behavioral observations between the resident and all visitors on\nSupervised Visitation Form.\n3. Redirects resident or visitors of any inappropriate behaviors and notifies Supervisor.\nCurrently Vista Maria’s visiting policy does not prohibit fictive kin, non-family members,\nchildren of any age or any number of people from visiting at one time. It seems Vista\nMaria routinely allows both related and unrelated minors inside of its residential\n4",
    "buildings without verifying their identity. The policy does not address how staff are to\nhandle minor visitors. This policy needs to be revised.\nTechnical Assistance\nIt is strongly suggested that Vista Maria consider restricting visitors to parents/\nguardians/attorneys/clergy and those who are ordered visits by the Court. Minors may\nbe restricted unless a monthly sibling visit is required by DHHS and Vista Maria is able\nto verify the identity of the sibling(s). It is suggested that perspective adoptive and/or\nfoster parents be encouraged to schedule a family therapy session with the resident and\nher therapist.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: An unidentified Supervisor or Team Leader allowed four minors\nto visit Resident E. The minors were not on her approved visitor\nlist. Allowing unverified children to visit residents appears to be\ndone across Vista’s campus as a matter of routine.\nThe existing policy indicates the supervisor is supposed to verify\nthe visitor’s identity. However, it is uncommon for minor children\nto carry ID. Vista Maria’s policy does not address how staff are\nto handle child visitors.\nStaff 1 supervised Resident E’s visit according to the visiting\npolicy. However, Resident E reported that Child Visitor 2\nslipped her a pair of crafting scissors when they hugged good-\nbye in the hallway after the visit ended.\nThe scissors were not found when the resident was searched\nbefore entering the wing.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nOnce an acceptable corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nJanuary 20, 2020\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJanuary 28, 2020\n_______________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n6"
