    "Allegation Once youth go into their rooms at their placement, they are\nconfined to their rooms. The youth cannot exit once their doors\nare closed. There are no fire extinguishers in their rooms. The\nwindows do not open. There are limited staff.\nInvestigation Independent Living Supervisor (IL Supervisor) & Director of\nFoster Care Services (Director of FC Services) were\ninterviewed face-to-face together during the facility tour on\n8/15/2024. Both stated the agency has the appropriate amount of\nfire extinguishers as well as ceiling sprinklers. The doors on youth\nbedrooms lock from the outside but are not capable of locking\nfrom the inside. This is to ensure youth belongings are safe and\nsecure. The bedroom windows are not able to be opened and that\nis due to concern of youth leaving or entering outside of approved\nhours and without staff knowledge. IL Supervisor and Director of\nFC Services stated the windows are able to be broken in the event\nof an emergency.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility (Detroit\nlocation) on 8/15/2024. He stated staff and other youth review\nwhat steps to take in case of a fire or other emergency. He stated\nthey practice fire drills every so often but was not specific with how\noften and they have an identified safe location to meet in the event\nof a tornado. Youth A demonstrated that he was able to open the\ndoor from inside his bedroom even though it was locked from the\noutside. Youth A was asked about the ability to evacuate out his\nbedroom window in case of an emergency since the windows do\nnot open. He stated he is not sure if he would be able to break it in\norder to evacuate but believes he could do it.\nCity of Detroit Inspection Supervisor was interviewed via\ntelephone on September 25, 2024. He stated at least one\nwindow per bedroom must be operational, meaning the windows\nneed to have the ability to open. He further stated there cannot be\nanything that requires special knowledge impeding exit such as\nbars on the windows.\nRedford Township officials were unable to be interviewed.\nThree attempts were made to speak to someone and although\nvoicemails were exchanged on two occasions, successful contact\nmade was not established.\nTour Observation:\nA tour of the independent living facility at 20775 Pembroke Ave.,\nDetroit, MI 48219 occurred on August 15, 2024. Upon entering the\nlocation there is an office to the left and a common area for the\nyouth to the right that includes a mounted flat screen TV, couches\n2",
    "and chairs. Straight ahead is a laundry area, kitchen and a\ndesignated, locked maintenance/storage area. There are hallways\non both sides of the entrance, each with 6 bedrooms, totaling 12\nbedrooms. The facility has sprinklers on the ceiling providing\ncoverage for the entire building including all of the bedrooms and\ncommon area. In addition, there are wall mounted fire\nextinguishers inside the kitchen, on the outside wall of the kitchen\nand down each hallway. The youth bedrooms were observed.\nEach youth has a spacious bedroom with windows that do not\nopen, however can be broken in the event of an emergency. The\nbedroom doors have locks on the outside but no lock on the\ninside, so youth are able to exit from the inside even if the door is\nlocked from the outside. I asked staff to “lock me in” and I was\neasily able to exit with no issues. There are posted evacuation\nplans on the wall.\nA tour of the independent living facility at 26645 W. Six Mile Rd.,\nRedford, MI 48240 occurred on August 15, 2024. Upon entering\nthe location there is an open concept that allows you to view the\nfar wall from the entrance. Just inside the door is a common area,\nkitchen, dining seating for the youth and a larger common area\nwith a TV and adequate seating. Several fire alarms and\nsprinklers are visible throughout the facility. In addition, there are\nseveral fire extinguishers, including a large one inside the kitchen\narea. This location has 10 youth bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2-\n3 large windows that can be used in the event of an emergency.\nThe windows do not open, however can be broken in the event of\nan emergency. The bedroom doors have locks on the outside but\nno lock on the inside, so youth are able to exit from the inside\neven if the door is locked from the outside. I asked staff to “lock\nme in” and I was easily able to exit with no issues. Evacuation\nplans on posted on the wall.\nAnalysis The agency is found in non-compliance. Based upon completed\ninterviews and observation of the independent living facilities the\nbedroom windows are not able to be opened in the event of an\nemergency. The windows do appear to be easily broken, however,\naccording to zoning requirements the windows must be\noperational.\nConclusion Violation Established\n3",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n__________________________________10/4/2024______________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n10/8/2024\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n4"
