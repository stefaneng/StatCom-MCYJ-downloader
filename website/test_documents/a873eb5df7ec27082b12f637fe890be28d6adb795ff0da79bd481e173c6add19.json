    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not limited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing a\nyouth on any part of their body.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation On 6/20/24 Youth A alleged Staff 1 poked her in the stomach and\npinched and bent her fingers back.\nInvestigation Girlstown is a non-secure treatment facility located in a residential\nneighborhood in Belleville. The facility does not use or train staff\nin physical restraint. They rely on law enforcement to intervene in\ncrisis situations.\nInterviews:\nI was assigned this investigation on 6/21/24 and notified\nResidential Director of the allegation by phone.\nI attempted to reach Complainant on 6/24/24 and 6/25/24, but the\nnumber was out of service.\nOn 6/24/24 I notified Youth A’s Foster Care Worker of the\ninvestigation assignment via email.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 6/25/24. She said she has\nknown Staff 1 for six months and never got along well with her.\nPrior to the alleged incident, Youth A said she was arguing with\nvarious staff members, but she could not recall what she was\narguing about. “I tried to leave my room and Supervisor stood in\nfront of my door. Staff 1 poked my side with her pointy nails and\nkept laughing. Then Staff 1 pinched my fingers and bent them\nback.” Youth A said she did not know why Staff 1 pinched and\nbent her fingers. “The cops came and took me.”\nYouth A said the incident happened in her bedroom where there\nare no cameras. She said no one saw Staff 1 poke her side or\npinch and bend her fingers back. Youth A denied having any\n2",
    "marks or bruises as a result of the poking and bending. I\nobserved Youth A’s hands and saw no evidence of injury.\nOn 6/26/24 Government Worker was assigned to a similar\ninvestigation so while this was not a joint investigation, portions of\nit were completed jointly.\nI interviewed Supervisor jointly with Government Worker on\n7/1/24. She has worked at the facility for five years. On the\nevening of 6/20/24, Supervisor said she went upstairs where the\nyouth’s bedrooms are located and saw Youth A yelling, cussing\nand threatening others. Youth A and Staff 2 were in Youth A’s\nbedroom as Supervisor stood in the doorway. Staff 1 entered the\nyouth’s bedroom. “Youth A kept trying to come out of the room.\nShe kept trying to push to get through me forcefully bumping me.\nThe other girls wanted to get at her. I was afraid they would hurt\nher. Youth A put her hands on Staff 2 arms. Staff 1 and I got her\noff. Youth A kicked Staff 1 on her leg. I asked Staff 1 to go call\nthe police. The police arrived within ten minutes. Youth A swung\nat police and refused their directions. I came downstairs to gather\npaperwork.”\nSupervisor said Youth A was not injured after this incident and\ndenied seeing Staff 1 poke, pinch or bend the youth’s fingers\nback.\nI interviewed Staff 1 jointly with Government Worker on 7/1/24.\nShe has worked at the facility for over a year. Staff 1 said Youth A\ngot mad when she was asked to remove her clothes from the\nshared bathroom. “She wouldn’t follow directives and threw a\nbook at staff. We told her to stop. Youth T ran full force toward\nStaff 2 and grabbed and held her arms. I massaged her hand to\nrelease her grip. She instantly kicked my upper thigh…The kids\nthreatened to hurt her if she hit staff. We protected her from the\nother girls.”\nI asked Staff 1 to describe how she “massaged” Youth T’s hand to\nrelease her grip on Staff 2. She demonstrated a commonly used\nCPI defensive technique designed to immobilize a person’s hand\nand minimize injury and said Staff 2 taught her this move. She\ndenied poking Youth A in her side or stomach.\nI interviewed Staff 2 jointly with Government Worker on 7/1/24 via\nphone. She has worked at the facility for nine years. Staff 2\nrecalled “Youth A was verbally abusive to me and Staff 1. The\nother kids wanted to attack her. She tried to get through me and\n3",
    "Supervisor because she wanted to fight the girls who wanted to\nfight her. Youth A grabbed my arm. Staff 1 got her loose from my\narm…I did not see if Staff 1 bent her fingers or not…I have used\nthe CPI ‘release grip’ in the past…I did not see Staff 1 poke or\npush her side or stomach.”\nDocuments reviewed:\nAn incident report by Staff 2 dated 6/20/24 at 8:45pm indicated\nYouth A was noncompliant when asked to remove her clothes off\nthe bathroom floor. She yelled, swore and called staff “bitches.”\nYouth A went into her room continuing abusive language. The\nother girls screamed at her. Supervisor was called to assist.\nYouth A tried to push past staff, grabbed Staff 2’s arm. Staff 1\nassisted in getting Youth A’s hand away. Youth A tried to leave\nthe room. Staff had to get the other girls to their rooms because\nthey were trying to get to Youth A. Youth A pushed, kicked and hit\nstaff then calmed down when she saw the police pull up. Youth A\nwas handcuffed and taken by police.\nI reviewed a Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) manual obtained\nfrom another child caring institution that uses it. I identified the\nOne-Hand Hair Pull Release as a protective technique resembling\nhow Staff 1 described “massaging” Youth A’s hand to loosen her\ngrip. For this technique the manual instructs staff to immobilize\nthis grab by securing the person’s hand, to your head in the case\nof hairpulling. By using one or both of your hands to immobilize\nthe person’s hand, you can prevent further grabbing of hair and\nminimize injury. Move your head toward the person, leveraging\nthe arm position to a 45-degree angle. The grip of the hair pull is\nlevered backward, reducing the strength of the grip and opening\nup the weak point of the grab at the fingers. At the same time,\nyou can gain a psychological advantage by using verbal\ndistraction or an element of surprise. As your hair is released,\nattempt to move out of the way to maintain safety. In this case,\nStaff 1 used a version of this technique to loosen Youth A’s grip\nfrom another staff’s arm instead of from her own hair.\nAnalysis There is no evidence Staff 1 poked Youth A in the side or stomach\nwith her fingernail. Although Staff 1 is not formally trained in\nphysical management, she said she utilized a version of a\ndefensive technique she learned informally in order to loosen and\nremove Youth A’s grip from Staff 2’s arm. Youth T did not sustain\nany injuries as a result of Staff 1 removing the youth’s grip from\nStaff 2’s arm.\n4",
    "CONSULTATION\nGirlstown staff should not use defensive techniques on which they\nare not trained. If on occasion staff need to use such techniques,\nthey should be trained.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules.\nJuly 9, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 15, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n5"
