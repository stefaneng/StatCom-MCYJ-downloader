After returning to the facility, Youth A reported she\nand Youth B had sex at the YMCA, therefore Therapist met with\nYouth A to discuss the situation further. Youth A reported when\nthey arrived at the YMCA, Staff 1 was at the front desk trying to\ncheck in, but he was having difficulties and this was taking a while.\nYouth A reported she and Youth B went to the family restroom\nand locked themselves in a restroom stall. Youth A reported Youth\nB asked her many times to have sex with him, and it was her first\ntime. Youth A reported they were on the floor in the stall at the\nYMCA and it was consensual. Later that night, Youth B tried to\nbeat down Youth A’s door because Youth A told staff what\nhappened, and he was initially denying anything occurred.\nTherapist reported a few days later, Youth B finally admitted he\nand Youth A had sex at the YMCA. Youth B told Therapist they\ntook advantage of Staff 1 by running away from him because\nYouth B knew Staff 1 was older and couldn’t move quickly.\nTherapist reported Youth A and Youth B were on precautions prior\nto going to the YMCA, but no one expected this to happen\nbecause a couple days prior Youth B was holding a weapon, tried\nto break in Youth A’s room and threatened to hurt her. Therapist\nreported they had no indications Youth A and Youth B liked each\nother because they showed no interest in each other prior to this\nincident. Therapist reported that’s why they allowed only one staff\nto take the youth to the YMCA instead of having two staff.\nTherapist reported since the event, staff are always required to be\nwithin arm’s length of Youth A and Youth B. Therapist reported\nwhen staff redirect Youth A and Youth B away from each other or\nget in between them, Youth B yells at staff, becomes physically\naggressive towards them and threatens them.
