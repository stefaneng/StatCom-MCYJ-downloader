    "(b) Facilitating services and parenting time for children for\npurposes of reunification.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The case manager did not provide case management as required.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS\nComplainant – This investigation was initiated internally after\nconcerns arose during an investigation of Community Care\nOrganization. That investigation resulted due to allegations\nsubmitted by Foster Care Supervisor 1, a supervisor at Lenawee\nCounty DHHS. That investigation is documented in special\ninvestigation report #2024C0001069SI. During that investigation, it\nwas determined most of the items alleged to have not been\ncompleted by Community Care Organization were the\nresponsibility of Lenawee County DHHS staff.\nFoster Care Supervisor 1 –Foster Care Supervisor 1 was\ninterviewed via Microsoft Teams on 1/25/2024. She indicated she\nhas been assigned at Lenawee County DHHS for Youth A’s case\nsince he came into care. Foster Care Supervisor 1 reported Youth\nA was referred to Community Care Organization’s Independent\nLiving Plus (ILP) home and program by Lenawee County DHHS\nstaff upon removal from his parental home. They accepted Youth\nA into their program on 6/16/2023. After accepting Youth A’s case,\nCommunity Care Organization’s Program Manager/Foster Care\nSupervisor (Foster Care Supervisor 2) told Foster Care Supervisor\n1 Community Care Organization does not provide services to birth\nparents. Foster Care Supervisor 1 reported she reviewed\nCommunity Care Organization’s contract and realized they do not\nprovide services to birth parents at which time Lenawee County\nDHHS took over case management of Youth A. Foster Care\nSupervisor 1 stated she was assigned as primary supervisor and\na DHHS foster care worker was assigned as the primary worker\non the case as of 7/24/2023. During this interview, Foster Care\nSupervisor 1 expressed her misunderstanding of the Independent\nLiving Plus contract and responsibilities. She came to the\nrealization that Community Care Organization staff were not\nresponsible for the allegations she included in her complaint\nagainst them as they were no longer responsible for case\nmanagement of Youth A once she told them her staff would be\ntaking over case management responsibility. She reported her\nstaff relied on Community Care Organization to enroll the youth in\nschool, ensure his medical care follow-up services, authorize\n2",
    "mental health follow-up services, and complete social work\ncontacts, none of which were completed timely. She stated the\nallegations she submitted against Community Care Organization\nwere not valid as those allegations would have been the\nresponsibility of her staff.\nFoster Care Worker 1 – Foster Care Worker 1 was interviewed\nvia Microsoft Teams on 1/25/2024. She reported she was not the\ninitial DHHS foster care worker assigned but was assigned to\nYouth A’s case as primary foster care worker in August of 2023.\nShe reported she believed Community Care Organization staff\nwere responsible for case management of Youth A until the time\nhe left the program on 10/20/2023. She expressed concerns that\nCommunity Care Organization did not obtain a state ID for Youth\nA, did not complete timely social work contacts, did not arrange\nand facilitate all sibling visits, did not enroll him in school timely,\nand did not ensure he received mental health and medical care\nfollow-up services following an emergency room visit, all of which\nwas the responsibility of the primary foster care worker.\nFoster Care Supervisor 2 – Foster Care Supervisor 2, who is\nalso the Program Manager for Community Care Organization, was\ninterviewed via Microsoft Teams on 1/26/2024. She reported she\naccepted Youth A into Community Care Organization under the\nterms of their contract. She stated her understanding at the time\nthe case was accepted was that Lenawee County DHHS would\nhave family responsibility of the case to work with Youth A’s\nsibling and parents and Community Care Organization would have\ncase management of Youth A only, which is what has historically\nhappened whenever they accept a case involving parents and\nsiblings. Foster Care Supervisor 2 stated she was initially\nassigned as the supervisor for the whole case and had multiple\nconversations and email exchanges with Foster Care Supervisor 1\nto explain that she had only accepted case management\nresponsibilities on Youth A and that her agency could not provide\ncase management to the younger sibling and parents as their\ncontract does not allow them to do so. Foster Care Supervisor 2\nstated it did not seem as if Foster Care Supervisor 1 understood\nwhat Foster Care Supervisor 2 was attempting to explain and on\n7/24/2023 Lenawee County DHHS staff assigned themselves as\nprimary workers and supervisor on Youth A’s case. She stated\nshe asked Foster Care Supervisor 1 to add Foster Care\nSupervisor 2 back as primary supervisor on Youth A’s case\nmultiple times, but this never occurred. She indicated her agency\ncontinued to provide case management services as best they\n3",
