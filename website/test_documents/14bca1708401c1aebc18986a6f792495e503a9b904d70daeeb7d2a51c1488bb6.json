    "• (a) Eligibility requirements for youth to participate in\nthe program.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Leadership would only allow placement consideration of a\ntransgender youth at an all-male program. The male is biologically\nmale but identifies as female.\nInvestigation Complainant was interviewed via telephone on December 19,\n2024. Complainant stated they had no additional information.\nFormer Chief Administrator was interviewed via telephone on\nDecember 20, 2024. She stated she was terminated late\nafternoon on Friday, December 13, 2024. Just prior to her\ntermination she stated she was made aware of an email that\nPresident sent regarding Youth A. Youth A had been a youth at\nQueen of Angels and a referral was made to Holy Cross ILP\nprogram. Youth A is biologically male but identifies as female and\nsought placement at the agency’s female IL house. Former Chief\nAdministrator stated PAFC Administrative Assistant inquired to her\nregarding how to proceed with the referral because Youth A wants\nto go to female program and President responded by saying since\nyouth is a male he needs to go to a male IL house. Former Chief\nAdministrator reported agency practice for transgender youth is to\ninterview youth for both homes and where youth feel most\ncomfortable. Both Fayette IL home and Corcoran IL home have\nrooms with an attached bathroom, so they are able to\naccommodate gender identity and where the youth feels more\ncomfortable. Former Chief Administrator clarified she was told\nabout the existence of the email chain but does not have access\nto it. She stated agency policy is written in a way that outlines\nyouth preference is accommodated. She is aware because she\nwrote the policy based on licensing rules and DHS policy.\nPAFC Administrative Assistant (PAFC AA) was interviewed\nvia telephone on January 2, 2025. She stated there is a\nscheduled interview today with Youth A to determine if she would\nbe appropriate for placement in their independent living home.\nThis interview was rescheduled from December 16, 2024. She\nstated Youth A wanted to be placed in Corcoran which is their\nfemale home, but they are not able to place in the female program\nbut did not elaborate on the reason. She asked the DHS Foster\nCare worker (DHS FCW) if they would consider King House which\nis their all-male independent living program.\n2",
    "DHS Foster Care worker (DHS FCW) was interviewed via\ntelephone on January 27, 2025. She stated she is the assigned\nfoster care worker for Youth A since youth entered care in October\n2024. Youth is biologically male but identifies as female. She\nstated she participated in an interview with Youth A and Holy\nCross for potential placement in a female independent living\nfacility on January 2, 2025. The interview is regarding potential\nplacement at Holy Cross King House which she believed at the\ntime was their female house, but later learned is a male IL house.\nIt had been rescheduled from December 16, 2024. She stated the\ninterview went well. Holy Cross gave an overview of the program\nand rules. Youth A inquired about viewing the home and was told\nby Holy Cross staff that could occur if she was accepted into the\nprogram but didn’t appear very open to Youth A viewing the home.\nDHS FCW stated after the interview Holy Cross immediately sent\nher an email indicating Youth A would not be accepted into the\nprogram because of a past criminal charge for CSC. DHS FCW\nexpressed confusion as to why Holy Cross didn’t relay that would\nhave been a barrier for Youth A being accepted into the program\nprior to the interview. She stated other agencies have denied\nYouth A for the same reason and since the interview there was\nanother agency that has accepted Youth A into an independent\nliving program. DHS FCW stated she has been present with Youth\nA during independent living interviews. Youth A does not have a\nphone.\nDocuments reviewed\n• MISACWIS case file for Youth A that included a December\n16, 2024, social work contact: An independent living\ninterview with Holy Cross was scheduled for 12/16/24 via\nteams. The interview had to be rescheduled due to the fact\nthat Youth A was not made available for the meeting. The\nfoster parents were sent several reminders of the interview\nand failed to log on. DHHS will reschedule the interview at\na later time.\n• January 2, 2025, denial email from Holy Cross to DHS\nFCW. “Thank you for your recent referral to King House ILP\nprogram located in Clinton Township. After interviewing\nYouth A, we are unable to accept him at this time.\nContributing factors supporting this decision are listed as\nfollows: explosive behaviors, CSC charge, and sexually\nacting out behaviors.”\n• December 11, 2024, email from President to agency staff.\n“I spoke with licensing. Youth A should not be interviewing\nat Corcoran at this time”.\n3",
