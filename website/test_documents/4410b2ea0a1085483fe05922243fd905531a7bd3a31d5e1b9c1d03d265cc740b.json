Staff 1 said she then decided to get the soup can from Youth A and wiped\nthe soup off her face and playfully wipe the soup on Youth A’s cheek. Staff 1 said\nYouth A then said, “did you see that?

    "Staff 2 said Youth B grabbed Youth A from behind and pulled Youth A into the dining\nroom. Staff 2 said Youth A went upstairs and Staff 1 went into the bathroom. Staff 2\nsaid the police were called and they arrived and took statements from staff and\nyouth. Staff 2 said she has not seen Staff 1 ever be physically aggressive towards\nthe youth however said Staff 1 will often engage in power struggles about following\nrules of the facility with the youth. Staff 2 said the direct care workers are all trained\nto “tap out” in situations like this. Staff 2 said Staff 1 should have taken a break in\neither the staff office or outside and had a chance to walk away from the situation\ninstead of engaging like she did. Staff 2 said everyone in the house is aware of the\ntrauma that Youth A has about food as he was previously starved and therefore\nhaving any type of power struggle with Youth A regarding food is going to “set him\noff”. Staff 2 said Staff 1 does not exhibit good boundaries with the youth and will\noften share a lot of her personal life situations with the youth in the house, such as\nher break-up, and financial struggles.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via telephone on January 29, 2021. Staff 3 said Staff 1\nand Youth A were in the kitchen arguing about dinner and Staff 1 told Youth A to\nhave soup which he did not want, so Youth A went upstairs. Staff 3 said Staff 1 was\nwalking around the house getting shower supplies for Youth C. Staff 3 said she was\nin the staff office and heard Staff 2 screaming “stop it”. Staff 3 said she left the staff\noffice and saw Staff 1 go into the bathroom and then back into the kitchen. Staff 3\nsaid Staff 1 was standing by the stove and Youth A was leaning on the counter. Staff\n3 said Staff 1 walked two to three steps towards Youth A and slapped Youth A in the\nface. Staff 3 said Youth A said, “did you see that” and grabbed Staff 1 and punched\nher in the face. Staff 3 said Youth B then grabbed Youth A and got him away from\nStaff 1. Staff 3 said Youth A went upstairs with Staff 2 following him and Staff 1 went\ninto the bathroom and closed the door. Staff 3 said she went to the staff office to call\nthe police however Therapist was already on the phone with the police when she got\ninto the staff office. Staff 3 said she checked on all the youth and then went upstairs\nand checked on Youth A. Staff 3 said Youth A had a red mark on his face from the\nslap from Staff 1. Staff 3 said all direct care workers are trained to “tap out” in\nsituations such as this which would allow another staff to take over and the staff that\nis struggling to get a break. Staff 3 said she believes Staff 1 should have tapped out\nand not engaged in the situation. Staff 3 said Youth A has food trauma from being\nstarved and staff know not to argue with him regarding food. Staff 3 said it is also\nknown that when Youth A was given food it was often a jar of peanut butter and so\nstaff are never to offer Youth A peanut butter and Staff 1 asked Youth A if he wanted\nsoup or a peanut butter sandwich during this incident, which made Staff 3 feel that\nStaff 1 was intentionally provoking Youth A. Staff 3 said Staff 1 will often engage in\npower struggles with the youth in the facility, shows favoritism to certain youth, and\nwill call youth names such as “tubby”. Staff 3 said Staff 1 is very open about her\npersonal life and has told the youth about her break-up with her boyfriend, going to\njail for the night due to an assault on the boyfriend’s daughter, and not having a\nplace to live.\n6",

Specifically, she heard Staff 1 telling Youth A and Youth B to\nmake something for themselves as she was not going to cook. Therapist said about\nfifteen minutes after this argument she heard screaming coming from the kitchen.\nTherapist said she stepped out of the staff office and into the hallway and looked\ndirectly into the kitchen where Staff 1 was wiping soup off her face yelling at Youth A\nwho was yelling back at her. Therapist said Youth A was leaning against the counter\nand Staff 1 approached him and slapped him on the face. Therapist said it appeared\nas though Staff 1’s hand was partially closed in a fist. Therapist said Youth A then\ngrabbed Staff 1 and Therapist said it was at that time she ran back into the staff\noffice and called the police for assistance. Therapist said once she got off the phone\nYouth A was upstairs, and Staff 1 was in the bathroom. Therapist said the police\ninterviewed the youth and staff and left.
