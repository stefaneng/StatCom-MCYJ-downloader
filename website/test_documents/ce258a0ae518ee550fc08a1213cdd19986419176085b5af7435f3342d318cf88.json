The complaint noted the following:\nYouth A (16) is currently placed at Spectrum Juvenile Justice Services.\nSupervisor 1 is a supervisor at the facility. On an unknown date last weekend,\nYouth A had to be restrained. There was an argument with the staff regarding\nhim getting more food at dinnertime. During the restraint, someone had dug their\nfingernails into his back. Youth A has healing scratch marks on his back\ncurrently. There was a previous incident with Supervisor 1 when he was trying to\ntake away an extra blanket Youth A had. Supervisor 1 threw water in Youth A’s\nface. Supervisor 1 is a known bully at the facility.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 07/22/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth A reported that a few weeks ago Supervisor 1 was being “petty” and would\nnot allow Youth A to have all of the extra blankets that he had. Youth A said that he\nhad five blankets and acknowledged that youth are not supposed to have that many,\nbut other staff don’t make an issue of it. Youth A said that he had just got his\nblankets back from the laundry and Supervisor 1 took one. Youth A said that he told\nSupervisor 1 he was going to get “all up in Supervisor 1’s shit.” Youth A said that\nSupervisor 1 brought medication to pass and Youth A “ran up on Supervisor 1.”\nYouth A said that Supervisor 1 was holding a medication cup with water and threw\nthe water in Youth A’s face. Youth A said he was restrained and put in his room.\nYouth A denied any injuries, saw the nurse, and did not need any follow up from this\nincident.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility, on 07/22/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Supervisor 1 reported that he has worked at the facility for 13 years and\nthis is the first time a youth made an allegation regarding him. Supervisor 1 reported\nthat youth blankets had been washed during shower time and kids usually have two\nor three blankets. Youth A had four blankets and got upset when Supervisor 1 did\nnot allow him to have a fifth. Supervisor 1 said he went to get medication to pass to\n4",
    "the youth on the Pod and also had the Security Officer come to the pod since Youth\nA was so upset. Supervisor 1 said that when he went to Youth A’s door, Youth A\ncame out swinging and the Security Officer had to intervene to escort Youth A back\nto his bedroom. Supervisor 1 said that he went to the control room and did not have\nany further contact with Youth A that day. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A would have\nlikely seen the nurse afterward. This incident reportedly occurred about a month\nago.\nI interviewed the Security Officer at the facility, on 07/22/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The Security Officer reported that Supervisor 1 had called him to assist\nwith medication and when Youth A’s door was opened, Youth A rushed out and\nswung on Supervisor 1. The Security Officer said he was able to get Youth A into a\nhold, but they stumbled and went to the ground. The Security Officer said he got up\nand held out a hand to assist Youth A up from the floor and Youth A went to his\nroom. During the debriefing of this situation later in the day, the Security Officer said\nYouth A reported being angry about the blanket from earlier. No injuries were noted\nby the Security Officer. The Security Officer said that Supervisor 1 did not throw\nwater in Youth A’s face, and he is not the kind of staff that would do that.\nYouth B was interviewed on 07/22/21, and the DHHS Specialist was present. Youth\nB said that he thought Youth A got restrained because of a blanket, but he did not\nsee what happened.\nYouth C was interviewed on 07/22/21, and the DHHS Specialist was present. Youth\nC reported that Youth A was upset because Supervisor 1 had taken an extra\nblanket. Youth C said that he saw Supervisor 1 throw water at Youth A when\nSupervisor 1 opened Youth A’s door. Youth C said he was taking a shower on the\npod and looked over. Youth C said Youth A then swung on Supervisor 1 and was\nrestrained by Supervisor 1 and escorted to Youth A’s bedroom. Youth C reported\nthat Supervisor 1 was choking Youth A, but when Youth A yelled for Supervisor 1 to\nstop, he did and then exited Youth A’s room. Youth C said that he heard Youth A\nhad marks on his back but did not see them himself. It is notable that there were no\nother reports of this occurring.\nI met with the Chief Administrator on 07/22/21 at the facility. The CA reported that\nshe had seen the video and did not see where Supervisor 1 threw water on Youth A.\nYouth D refused to be interviewed.\nYouth E was interviewed on 07/22/21 and the DHHS Specialist was present. Youth\nE initially said that he was in the shower and did not see what happened but then\nsaid he heard footsteps and looked over to see Supervisor 1 throw water in Youth\nA’s face. Youth E said that Youth A was then restrained and put in his room. He did\nnot see anything else.\n5",
    "I met with the Director on 07/27/21 at the facility. The Director reported that he\nreviewed video of this incident when it occurred and did not see Supervisor 1 throw\nwater at Youth A.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation includes the following, with\napplicable information outlined:\n Original incident report authored by Supervisor 1, reviewed by FM2, approved\nby the Director, and dated 06/02/2021. The incident report was consistent\nwith Supervisor 1 and Security Officer’s interviews.\n Email from the Director noting that due to this incident occurring several\nweeks prior, there is no video.\n Facility Behavior Modification policy, dated 07/23/20\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4157 Behavior management.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures that describe the institution’s behavior\nmanagement system. The policies and procedures shall be\nreviewed annually and updated as needed. These shall be\navailable to all residents, their families, and referring\nagencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with the rule. Although water could have\nsplashed onto Youth A when he exited his room aggressively,\nas Supervisor 1 was holding the cup of water, there is\ninsufficient evidence to support the allegation that Supervisor 1\nintentionally threw water in Youth A’s face in response to Youth\nA’s behavior.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth A was restrained at the facility by staff. Staff dug their nails into youth's back\nresulting in scratch marks.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received 07/16/21 and jointly investigated with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The complaint noted the following:\nYouth A (16) is currently placed at Spectrum Juvenile Justice Services.\nSupervisor 1 is a supervisor at the facility. On an unknown date last weekend,\nYouth A had to be restrained. There was an argument with the staff regarding\nhim getting more food at dinnertime. During the restraint, someone had dug their\n6",
    "fingernails into his back. Youth A has healing scratch marks on his back\ncurrently. There was a previous incident with Supervisor 1 when he was trying to\ntake away an extra blanket Youth A had. Supervisor 1 threw water in Youth A’s\nface. Supervisor 1 is a known bully at the facility.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 07/22/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nYouth A reported that during dinner on a recent weekend, Supervisor 1 took the\nextra food from dinner and sent it back to the kitchen. Youth A said that Supervisor 1\nwas doing this to “mess with us.” Youth A said he was mad and went in and out of\nhis room and was swearing at Supervisor 1 and calling Supervisor 1 names. Youth A\nsaid Supervisor 1 called for security to come to the pod. Youth A said that he “ran up\non Supervisor 1” who grabbed Youth A and took Youth A back to his room. Youth A\nreported no injuries from this interaction and said he did see the nurse afterward.\nYouth A said that Supervisor 1 was not working the Pod that day, but was in and out.\nStaff 1 was the assigned staff. Youth A went on to say that the next day, when\nSupervisor 1 came to his bedroom door to unlock it and let Youth A out, Youth A\nwas still angry from the day before so he “squared up” to fight Supervisor 1. Youth A\nsaid that he started hitting Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 1 fell into Youth A and they\nhit a wall. Youth A said that he had his shirt off during this incident. Youth A said that\nSupervisor 1 grabbed Youth A and sat on his neck as Youth A was sitting by the\nwall. Youth A said that the Security Officer came and escorted Youth A to his room.\nYouth A said that he got marks on his back from the altercation with Supervisor 1,\nbut he was not sure how. Youth A said that Supervisor 1 has not worked on his pod\nsince this incident. Youth A reported that he told his mother about this and other\nyouth on his pod noticed the scratches on his back. Youth A said that he did see the\nnurse afterward.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility jointly with the DHHS Specialist. Supervisor\n1 reported that he has worked at the facility for 13 years and this is the first time a\nyouth made an allegation regarding him. Supervisor 1 reported that on the previous\nFriday, around dinner time, Supervisor 1 was making rounds and went on the A/B\npod control room. He said the kitchen was bringing food to the pods and Staff 1 was\nworking the pod. Supervisor 1 said that he put the prepared dinner plates on the cart\nfor Staff 1 and she advised Supervisor 1 that there were only five youth on the pod.\nSupervisor 1 sent two extra plates back to the kitchen because that’s what the\nfacility does if there is not enough for everyone to have extras. Supervisor 1 said that\nYouth A became angry at him sending the plates back because Youth A wanted the\nextra food and started banging on the control room door. Supervisor 1 said that he\ntried to talk to Youth A with the Security Officer, but Youth A was still so angry and\nwas trying to get at Supervisor 1. The Security Officer was between Youth A and\nSupervisor 1, but Youth A got around the Security Officer and was swinging at\nSupervisor 1. Supervisor 1 said that the Security Officer put Youth A in a physical\nmanagement hold and then escorted him to his room. Supervisor 1 reported that\nYouth A made no complaint of injury and noted that this restraint did not go to the\nfloor. Supervisor 1 reported that the next day, he was on Pod A and getting youth\nout of their rooms after shift change. Supervisor 1 said that when he unlocked Youth\n7",
    "A’s door, Youth A came out with his fists balled up ready to fight. Supervisor 1 said\nhe asked Youth A what he was doing and wasn’t sure if he was playing or not. Youth\nA was told to stop but didn’t and Supervisor 1 held his arm out to keep distance from\nYouth A. Supervisor 1 said Youth A was swinging on him, so he grabbed Youth A to\ntry and put him in a restraint hold but it was difficult because Youth A was fighting\nback and they fell to the floor. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A got up and Supervisor\n1 was still trying to hold him, but Youth A continued to resist. Supervisor 1 said he\nfollowed Youth A to the other side of the pod and was able to get a proper hold on\nYouth A. Supervisor 1 said he was on his knees behind Youth A and holding Youth\nA in a Primary Restraint Technique hold. The Security Officer came and took over\nthe hold and escorted Youth A to his room. Supervisor 1 said that he did not notice\nscratches on Youth A and Youth A did not complain of being hurt. Supervisor 1\ndenied being on Youth A’s neck at any time. Supervisor 1 said he was just trying to\nkeep Youth A from hurting him and he assessed his restraint to be appropriate and\nnoted that it followed Handle with Care protocol.\nI interviewed the Security Officer at the facility, on 07/22/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The Security Officer reported a consistent account of what occurred as\nreported by Supervisor 1 in the first incident. The Security Officer said that when he\narrived on the pod during Supervisor 1’s restraint of Youth A in the second incident,\nhe observed Youth A seated on the floor and Supervisor 1 kneeling behind Youth A.\nSupervisor 1 was reportedly leaning over the top of Youth A from the back and\nholding Youth A’s arms in front of Youth A. The Security Officer reported that he\nrelieved Supervisor 1 and escorted Youth A to his room. The Security Officer stated\nthat he has watched the tape of this incident and said that based on what he saw,\nSupervisor 1 tried to restrain Youth A and they fell to the floor. The Security Officer\nsaid that staff 2 was there but was not assisting Supervisor 1 in the restraint.\nStaff 1 was interviewed at the facility on 07/22/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 1 reported that the extra plates were sent back because there wasn’t enough\nfor all the youth to have an extra plate. Staff 1 said Youth A was mad about this and\nwas at the control room yelling at Supervisor 1. Staff 1 said that when Supervisor 1\nwent out on the pod, Youth A swung at him and was restrained by the Security\nOfficer. Staff 1 saw the Security Officer put Youth A in a hold and walk him to his\nroom. Staff 1 said that Youth A walked without struggling. Staff 1 did not hear any\ncomplaint of Youth A being hurt or injured. Staff 1 said the other kids were telling\nYouth A that he should wait for Supervisor 1 to be alone to swing on him next time.\nStaff 1 said that Supervisor 1 handles the kids well.\nYouth B was interviewed, on 07/22/21, and the DHHS Specialist was present. Youth\nB said that he recalled Youth A being upset over not being given extra food. Youth B\nsaid he was seated by his door on the pod had said Youth A ended up getting\nrestrained by Supervisor 1, but Youth B didn’t see it because he didn’t look over at it,\nnoting he could get in trouble if he was looking at it. Youth B said that Youth A was\nthen taken into his bedroom. Youth B said that Youth D got up and looked but did\nnot know what he saw. Youth B said the Security Officer was there and assisted\n8",
    "also. Youth B said the next day Youth A came out of his room and fought Supervisor\n1. Youth B said the lights on the pod were initially off, so it was hard to see but Youth\nA had his fists up toward Supervisor 1 while Supervisor 1 was telling Youth A to\nstop. Youth B said there were other staff in the control room, but they didn’t come\nout. Youth B said Supervisor 1 restrained Youth A and they were “wrestling” on the\nfloor. The other staff came out of the control room and had the kids go back in their\nrooms, and at that point, Youth B said he could not see anything else that happened.\nAfterward, Youth B said that Youth A had scratches on his back and leg.\nYouth C was interviewed on 07/22/21, and the DHHS Specialist was present. Youth\nC reported a consistent account of the initial incident regarding the dinner extras as\nreported by Youth A and Supervisor 1. The second incident was reported to have\nstarted with Supervisor 1 unlocking Youth A’s room and Youth A swinging on\nSupervisor 1 because he was still mad about the previous issue with the food. Youth\nC said that he saw Supervisor 1 keep his arm up to keep Youth A back, but then\nsaw Supervisor 1 grab Youth A and “threw him to the ground, hit him two times in\nthe face, and put him in a headlock.” Youth C said Supervisor 1 was positioned\nbehind Youth A on the floor and had Youth A in a headlock until the Security Officer\ncame in to relieve him. Youth C said Youth A had scratches on his back and Youth\nA’s head hit the wall.\nYouth D refused to be interviewed.\nYouth E was interviewed on 07/22/21 and the DHHS Specialist was present. Youth\nE reported a consistent account of the initial incident regarding the dinner extras as\nreported by Youth A and Supervisor 1, although Youth E reported that he was not\nsure if it was Supervisor 1 or the Security Officer who restrained and escorted Youth\nA. Additionally, Youth E reported that there was only one or two extra plates for\nextras. Regarding the incident from the next day, Youth E reported a consistent\naccount of Youth A exiting his room swinging at Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 1\nholding his arm out to maintain distance. Youth E said that Supervisor 1 “tackled\nYouth A into the wall” and restrained Youth A in the corner. Youth E said it looked\nlike Supervisor 1 was holding Youth A by his neck and Supervisor 1 was on top of\nYouth A. The Security Officer came and told Youth A to get up and security walked\nYouth A to his room. Youth E said that he heard Youth A telling staff to stop from\ninside his room and saying that he couldn’t breathe. Youth E said that he looked in\nYouth A’s room and Supervisor 1 and Security Officer had Youth A on the floor on\nhis stomach. (It is noted that video review showed all other youth in their rooms\nwhen Youth A was escorted into his room by the Security Officer. Supervisor 1 did\nnot enter the room. The Security Officer exited promptly, and the door was closed.)\nMultiple attempts were made by me and the DHHS Specialist to reach Staff 2\nwithout success.\nI interviewed Staff 3 via phone jointly with the DHHS Specialist on 08/10/21. Staff 3\nreported that she was working on the adjoining pod, Pod B, but was in the control\n9",
    "room when this started. Staff 3 said that she glanced over to see Supervisor 1 was\nletting kids out of rooms and one of the other staff, Staff 2 or Staff 4 were supposed\nto be on the pod with Supervisor 1. Staff 3 said that she told Staffs 2 and 4 to go out\nand help Supervisor 1. Staff 3 said it was hard to see because the lights were off on\nthe pod but when she went over, she saw Supervisor 1 restraining Youth A and\nnoted that Supervisor 1 had Youth A pinned down over by the door. Staff 3 said that\nshe was supposed to be monitoring her own pod, so she helped ensure the kids on\nPod A were sent back into their rooms and then went back to her pod to let those\nkids out of their rooms. Staff 3 said she was current on her restraint training and\nreported that they are taught for staff to assist if another staff is struggling.\nI interviewed Staff 4 via phone jointly with the DHHS Specialist on 08/12/21. Staff 4\nreported that he was in the control room debriefing staff on the other pod and was\nabout to leave when this incident occurred. Staff 4 said Youth A was swinging on\nSupervisor 1 and Supervisor 1 “defended himself within protocol.” Staff 4 said he\nobserved a moderate tussle that was “in compliance” from his view from the control\nroom. Staff 4 recalled that Supervisor 1 took Youth A to the floor “within compliance”\nand “subdued” Youth A. Staff 4 said this was “clean from what he remembers.”\nSecurity came and helped with taking over the restraint. Staff 4 said that this incident\nwas compliant with Handle with Care and noted he is current on his training. Staff 4\nhas worked at the facility for about six years. When I noted that my video review did\nnot find Supervisor 1 to have followed Handle with Care, Staff 4 said that Supervisor\n1 was within protocol of keeping himself safe and Youth A safe and he had no\nissues with how Supervisor 1 handled this situation. When the DHHS Specialist\nasked Staff 4 why no staff intervened, Staff 4 advised that he was debriefing with\nanother staff on the other pod and that they did assist by calling security. Staff 4\nnoted that Supervisor 1 did not ask for assistance.\nVideo review of this incident shows Supervisor 1 unlock Youth A’s bedroom and\nYouth A exits with fists up and bouncing around like a boxer in front of Supervisor 1.\nSupervisor 1 put a hand out to keep distance and block Youth A from hitting him.\nThis continues for about 1 ½ minutes. Other staff are seen in the control room\nbehind Supervisor 1, but none come out until Supervisor 1 is fully engaged in the\nrestraint. Supervisor 1 initiates a restraint but is not able to get behind Youth A to put\nhim in an approved hold. Supervisor 1 pushes toward Youth A, with his arms\nwrapped around Youth A, who backs into a wall and the two fall to the floor.\nSupervisor 1 continues to struggle to get a proper hold on Youth A and the two\nwrestle on the floor until Youth A is able to get up to standing. Supervisor 1 was\nobserved on Youth A’s back with his feet off the floor at one brief time. Then, while\nupright, Supervisor 1 was observed holding Youth A in a headlock fashion and then\npushed Youth A to a closed door. At this time, Supervisor A was behind Youth A and\nforces Youth A to the floor by pulling him/pushing him to the right. Supervisor A still\ndoes not have Youth A in a proper Handle with Care hold and it has been about 15\nseconds from the time the restraint was initially attempted. Supervisor 1 is observed\nusing his body weight to lay on Youth A’s back for a couple seconds while Youth A\nwas kneeling on the floor with his face down. The two get turned upright so Youth A\n10",
    "is in a seated position and Supervisor 1 is behind him. Supervisor 1 is viewed laying\novertop of Youth A’s head/neck as the two continued to struggle. Staff 2 approached\nthe interaction and crouched down, but did not intervene. There are parts unable to\nbe verified at this time due to the camera view being blocked by Staff 2. The Security\nOfficer arrives and engages to apparently talk to Youth A. Supervisor 1 is still\nleaning over Youth A’s head/neck and holding Youth A’s arms in front of Youth A’s\nbody. The Security Officer engages and gets Youth A into a proper hold and they\nstand up with Youth A. Supervisor 1 disengages and walks away. Security Officer\nholds Youth A in the corner for a couple of seconds before escorting him to his\nbedroom. Supervisor 1 was physically managing Youth A for about one minute and\n37 seconds. During that time, about one minute and 28 seconds were on the floor.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation includes the following, with\napplicable information outlined:\n Safety plan commissioned by DHHS Specialist with facility, on 07/16/21,\nnoting Supervisor 1 will have another staff with him at all times when he\ninteracts with any child in the facility.\n Employee information for Supervisor 1. No disciplinary action since 2012. No\ndisciplinary action related to restraint. Current on restraint training as Handle\nwith Care was completed 02/25/21-verbal de-escalation component, and\n05/27/21-physical intervention component.\n Employee training information reviewed for Staffs 2, 4, and 5. All were up to\ndate on Handle with Care trainings which were received in February and\nMarch 2021 for all three.\n Photo of Youth A’s back\n Original incident report witness statement authored by Security Officer, dated\n07/11/21. The report noted the following, ‘This writer responded to a security\ncall to Pod A. This writer witnessed Supervisor 1 had Youth A in a PRT. This\nwriter took over the PRT and escorted Youth A to his room.’\n Original incident report witness statement authored by Supervisor 1, dated\n07/11/21. The report provided an account of the incident that was consistent\nwith the video until the point Supervisor 1 engaged physically with Youth A. At\nthat point, the incident report noted, ‘I then attempted to use Primary Restraint\nTechnique to keep from getting injured by Youth A. I attempted to try and\ngrab Youth A’s arms and place him in a PRT position, however, due to\nresident continuous punching this writer, we both fell on the floor. This writer\nwas able to hold on to resident arms while on the floor until the Security\nOfficer came and assisted this writer.

    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nprocedures regarding restraint. These policies and procedures\nshall be available to all residents, their families, and referring\nagencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility has violated the rule as this restraint did not follow\nthe approved restraint model policies. The facility uses Handle\nWith Care and the methods used in this incident (bear hug\ntackle of the youth, the manner the youth was taken to the floor\nafter getting up on his feet, and the way Supervisor 1 held Youth\nA’s arms in front of him while bending over him from behind) are\nnot approved under that model. The Supervisor should have\ncalled for staff assistance to have support prior to initiating the\nrestraint. The Supervisor should have disengaged when he\ncould not get a proper hold on the youth. Additionally, the other\nstaff present should have intervened to assist Supervisor 1 or\nswitch out with him, but they did not, until the Security Officer\narrived.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nPreviously cited under Emergency Rule 1 while in effect:\nSIR2020C0201018 initiated 5/13/20; CAP approved 9/24/20\nSIR2021C0108004 initiated 10/13/20; CAP approved 12/23/20\nSIR2021C0108005 initiated 10/22/20; CAP approved 12/23/20\nSIR2021C0212023; CAP pending\nSIR2021C0212025; CAP pending\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was found that the incident report did not\naccurately report what occurred when the video of the incident was reviewed. The\nincident report also documented that the youth was seen by the nurse, but there was\nno medical documentation to support that.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe incident reports identified above did not contain an accurate account of the\nphysical intervention used in this incident. Inaccuracies were observed in the witness\nreports submitted by Supervisor 1 and the Security Officer, as well as the summary\nreport submitted by FM2. FM1 merely submitted the summary written by FM2 into\n13",
    "MiSACWIS as he was not on duty the day of the incident. None of these reports\ndocument the bear hug tackle of Youth A by Supervisor 1 into the wall. They did not\ndocument that the two wrestled on the floor, and that Supervisor 1 was not able to\nget Youth A into a proper hold due to Youth A struggling. They did not document that\nSupervisor 1 then took Youth A to the floor by intentionally pulling/pushing him\ndown. They did not document that Supervisor 1 was viewed leaning over Youth A’s\nhead/neck and holding Youth A’s arms in front of Youth A. They did not document\nthat Supervisor 1 never got Youth A into an approved Handle with Care hold. The\nreports inaccurately state that Supervisor 1 attempted to physically mange Youth A\nand they both fell to the floor. The reports indicated that with the assistance of\nSecurity Officer, Youth A was immediately lifted from the ground and placed in a\nstanding primary restraint technique for one (1) minute and thirty (30) seconds. Upon\nvideo review it was observed that Supervisor 1 was physically managing Youth A for\nabout one minute and 37 seconds. During that time, about one minute and 28\nseconds were on the floor.\nI interviewed the CEO on 08/10/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. We reviewed\nthe video and compared video to the incident reports to identify the discrepancies. I\nadvised the CEO that there must be consistent and accurate reporting of incidents,\neven when restraints don’t go well. The CEO reported that they want to be\ntransparent and has expressed this need to the staff. The CEO identified that the\nstaff need more training on this.\nI interviewed the Director on 08/10/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist. We reviewed\nthe video and compared video to the incident reports to identify the discrepancies. I\nadvised the Director that there must be consistent and accurate reporting of\nincidents, even when restraints don’t go well. The Director initially reported that he\nthought the incident report captured what occurred, but later agreed, when reviewing\nthe video and incident reports, that they do not align. The Director reported\nagreement that Supervisor 1 should have/could have done something to get the\nattention of the other staff in the control room, and that the other staff could have\nintervened and assisted with the restraint as well. The Director reported that they will\nadjust staffing where it’s determined an issue occurs between a particular youth and\nstaff.\nI interviewed Facility Manager 1 (FM1) at the facility on 08/10/21. FM1 reported that\nhe enters incidents into MiSACWIS and noted that he did enter this incident report.\nFM1 reported that he did not review this incident and noted that FM2 reviewed this\nincident. FM1 explained that facility manager on duty reviews video of any incidents\nof physical management on the same day. If there is not an alignment, then they\nreview it with staff or has the supervisor meet with the staff and has the staff correct\nthe incident report if not accurate.\nI interviewed Facility Manager 2 (FM2) via phone, jointly with the DHHS Specialist\non 08/12/21. FM2 reported that he was never on the scene of this incident but was\nadvised of it. FM2 said that he reviewed video and debriefed with staff and the youth\n14",
    "afterward. FM2 said that in his review of the incident that it did follow Handle with\nCare. FM2 said that he felt that Supervisor 1 tried to get Youth A into hold from\nbehind him, but they fell to the ground. FM2 recalled that Supervisor 1 tried to get\nYouth A up and did not appear to intend to go to the ground. FM2 confirmed that he\nsaw Supervisor 1 holding Youth A in a seated position and leaning over Youth A to\nhold Youth A’s arms in front of him, and FM2 said that was in line with Handle with\nCare. When asked if this was a trained method for Handle with Care, FM2 said that\nthey are trained that if they cannot get a youth in a Handle with Care hold, to hold\nthe youth safely to pass off to someone else who comes to assist. FM2 reported that\nhe reviewed video of this incident and agreed that what was noted on the incident\nreport did not fully align with the video review. FM2 said that FM1 was the manager\nwho entered the restraint into MiSACWIS, not him.\nDocumentation was reviewed from Youth A’s medical file and confirmed with the\nDirector. There was no nursing note documenting that Youth A was seen on\n07/11/21 or 07/12/21. The nursing note assessing this youth from the restraint was\nnot done until 07/16/21.\nI reinterviewed FM2 at the facility on 08/31/2021. When asked why the content of the\nincident summary, written by FM2, which was the same as the incident report in\nMiSACWIS, did not accurately report what occurred based on the video review, FM2\nsaid that he did not write that part of the incident report. FM2 agreed that the youth\nwas not immediately lifted off the floor like the reports noted. FM2 said he did make\nthe contacts, reviewed video, and wrote the summary, but said what is in the\nsummary is not what he wrote. FM2 said that when he submits the summary it is\nreviewed by the Director and goes to FM1 to enter in MiSACWIS. When asked why\nFM2 documented on the Incident Report Summary that Youth A had been seen by\nthe Nurse, he said that the youth must have been or he would not have written that.\nFM2 said that he does not know why there is no nursing documentation for that.\nI reinterviewed FM1 at the facility on 08/31/21. When asked how and when the\ncontent of FM2’s summary could have been changed from the time FM2 wrote it\nuntil FM1 entered it in MiSACWIS, FM1 said that the reports are submitted on a\nfacility shared drive and the managers have access, along with the Director and\nAssistant, who both review and edit the Incident Reports before FM1 enters them in\nMiSACWIS. FM1 said that he did not change the content. He said he only entered it\nas it was into MiSACWIS.\nOn 08/31/21, I met with the Nurse who did the 07/16/21 evaluation of Youth A. She\nlooked in Youth A’s file in my presence and did not find any other documentation of\na 07/11/21 evaluation. The Nurse reported that there is no time when a youth would\nbe seen by a nurse and documentation not be completed. The Nurse could not recall\nif she worked on 07/11/21.\nOn 09/01/21, I spoke with the Assistant via phone. The Assistant clarified the\nprocess for restraint incident report processing. She confirmed that involved staff\n15",
    "complete a witness report, which is submitted to the supervisor and/or the facility\nmanager. The supervisor or facility manager who receives the witness reports\nreviews them, reviews the incident on video, and then writes an incident summary.\nThe facility manager then completes a MiSACWIS incident report. The summary and\nMiSACWIS incident report are sent to the Director for review (documentation and\nvideo review) and approval. The Assistant does not enter information into\nMiSACWIS and only pulls the reports from the system to send to DCWL. The\nAssistant reported that she does make some minor grammar edits to the summaries\nbut does not change any of the content. The Assistant reported that although she\nhas seen some videos of incidents, she does not review videos of incidents as part\nof this process.\n16",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint.\n(3) The written policy shall include all of the following:\n(a) Procedures for the review of an incident of restraint within\n48 hours by a level of supervision above the staff\nordering or conducting the restraint to determine if the\nrequirements of the institution’s procedures were adhered\nto in directing and conducting the restraint.\n(c) Procedures for recording restraints as an incident report.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as the incident reports,\ninclusive of the original witness statements, the summary report,\nand the MiSACWIS report, did not accurately report what\noccurred as reviewed on video. Additionally, the facility is in\nviolation of the rule as the comprehensive supervisory review\nprocess for incidents includes video review by the Facility\nManagers and Director. The supervisory review should have\nacknowledged and addressed the clear discrepancies in the\nincident reporting and the video. Finally, the 07/11/21 incident\nreport noted that Youth A was seen by the nurse, but the\ndocumentation in his medical file from the post-restraint nursing\nassessment was dated 07/16/21. No explanation was able to be\nprovided for this discrepancy. This is another inaccuracy in the\nincident reporting documentation that also was not found during\nthe supervisor’s comprehensive review.\nIt is also notable that the content of FM2’s summary, which was\nused for the MiSACWIS incident report, was either inaccurately\nreported by FM2 or changed by someone else prior to the\nsubmission to MiSACWIS. It is indeterminable which is\naccurate, but the facility CAP must address this as a concern,\nbecause in either case the report was a misrepresentation of\nwhat occurred.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nPreviously cited under Emergency Rule 2 while in effect:\nSIR 2021C0212025; CAP pending\n17",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I support the recommendations for 3rd\nprovisional license as noted in SIR 2021C0212023 and SIR 2021C0212025. This\nrecommendation is contingent on the facility submitting a timely, acceptable\ncorrective action plan for the noted violations.\nSeptember 02, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nSeptember 7, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n18"
