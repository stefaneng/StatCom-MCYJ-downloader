    "Referral to pediatric endocrinologist and bone age study. Referral for pediatric\ngastroenterologist.\nChief Administrator\nOn 5/9/22 the Chief Administrator (CA) was notified of the allegations. CA\nassisted with scheduling interviews with workers that are involved in the case\nand with the foster home.\nLicensing Worker 1\nLicensing Worker 1 was interviewed on-site on 5/11/22. Licensing Worker 1\nreported being assigned to investigate the allegations regarding Foster Parent 1.\nLicensing Worker 1 reported reviewing Youth A’s case in MiSACWIS and\ndetermined his weight changed from 59lbs in March 2019 to 51lbs in January 2022.\nYouth A’s new provider, Foster Parent 2, reported he gained twenty pounds since\nmoving to her home. Licensing Worker 1 reported they would speak with the Health\nLiaison Officer (HLO) for the county to see if there were any appointments that\nwere not completed by Foster Parent 1. Licensing Worker 1 noted the well child\nexams on file did not document medical interventions or referrals. Licensing\nWorker 1 reported Foster Parent 1 was feeding Youth A a pureed diet as\nprescribed, due to Youth A choking on pieces of food or throwing up. Foster Parent\n1 also told the worker that Youth A was very active and would lose weight easily.\nLicensing Worker 2\nLicensing Worker 2 was interviewed on-site on 5/11/22. Licensing Worker 2 is the\nregularly assigned worker for Foster Parent 1. Licensing Worker 2 stated she felt\nFoster Parent 1 did well with Youth A and did not have any concerns. During home\nvisits Youth A was always playing with toys and active. No concerns in the home\nwere identified. Licensing Worker 2 was aware of Youth A’s small stature and\nweight and did not observe anything that indicated he was not being taken care of.\nFoster Parent 1 informed Licensing Worker 2 about difficulties with Youth A's\nschool following his diet. The school was not pureeing Youth A’s food, which\ncaused him to choke or throw up. Foster Parent 1 then began sending all of his\nfood daily, to ensure the school followed the plan. In Licensing Worker 2’s opinion,\nFoster Parent 1 seemed to be a strong advocate for Youth A and did not express\nany difficulty in scheduling appointments or getting referrals.\nFoster Care Worker (FCW)\nFCW was interviewed on-site on 5/11/22. FCW reported being assigned as Youth\nA’s case manager for the past year and taking him to the well child exam in August\n2021, at which time no concerns were found by the physician. FCW reported that\nYouth A has gained 21lbs since changing placements in January 2022. FCW\nreported that Youth A recently had a swallow study completed and it was\ndetermined that he was not chewing his foods. This is likely due to Youth A having\nlow cognitive ability and an infant swallowing mechanism. Youth A was placed on\na strict puree diet with a supplemental drink (Ensure).\n4",
    "FCW reported she did not have any prior concerns with Youth A’s placement in\nFoster Parent 1’s home. FCW felt the foster parent did the best she could with the\nknowledge she had. When asked about specialist referrals for Youth A, FCW\nstated she was unsure if there were any referrals given to Foster Parent 1, or if\ndiscussions occurred at the doctor’s office. FCW never saw any referrals.\nFCW acknowledged difficulty with Youth A’s dental care, as he would not\ncooperate for any brushing or exams. Dental exams required sedation, which was\ndifficult to find in their area and required travel over an hour away. In addition, the\nsedation dentistry was not covered by Youth A’s medical plan, which resulted in\nFoster Parent 1 paying out of pocket. FCW was not aware of any assistance\nprovided to Foster Parent 1 regarding daily dental care or six-month dental exams.\nFCW was unsure if the worker or HLO was responsible for following up on missing\nmedical/dental information. FCW stated MISACWIS does not currently flag or alert\nstaff to things such as weight loss, missing medical documentation, or\nunscheduled referrals. FCW stated she was unsure if Foster Parent 1 was given a\nreferral by a physician, but then did not notify the agency or follow-up with the\nreferral, noting agency staff would have no way of knowing unless the foster parent\ntold them. FCW stated she hoped the findings of this investigation would help make\nsome recommendations on how to handle cases with medical needs. FCW verified\nYouth A was Medically Fragile Level 4, meaning that he was cognitively delayed,\nnon-verbal, and unable to do any of his personal care. FCW noted Youth A seems\nvery happy in his new placement. While FCW felt Foster Parent 1 did well with\nmeeting his needs, the new placement seems to be more active in advocating for\nhis care.\nLicensing Supervisor\nLicensing Supervisor was met on-site on 5/11/22 with a follow-up phone call later\nthat day. Licensing Supervisor reported that Foster Parent 1 asked for Youth A to\nmove in January 2022, as she was exhausted from caring for him, and the other\nspecial needs children in the home. Youth A was moved to the home of Foster\nParent 2, where he continues a puree diet and supplement drinks.\nLicensing Supervisor did not have any concerns about the care Youth A received\nat Foster Parent 1’s home. Licensing Supervisor was aware of the feeding\ndifficulties Foster parent 1 experienced with Youth A, but believed she had a good\nplan in place to maintain his weight. In addition, there was no concern expressed\nby physicians that had treated Youth A over the past three years. Since Youth A\nwas already 18 years old, no one was expecting for Youth A to grow or gain a\nsignificant amount of weight at this point. It appeared his malnourishment prior to\nentering care, along with his developmental delays, was the cause for his small\nstature. There was no concern that Foster Parent 1 was the cause of Youth A’s\nsmall size or low weight.\n5",
    "Licensing Supervisor reported that Foster Parent 2 is a good advocate for special\nneeds children and focused on advocating for Youth A to determine if any other\nmedical services are needed.\nFoster Parent 1\nOn 6/28/2022 a phone interview was completed with Foster Parent 1.\nFoster Parent 1 reported Youth A was underweight and very small when he was\nfirst placed in her home. Youth A had Down Syndrome and had been\nmalnourished for years before entering care. After moving to her home, Youth A\nattended a school for special needs children. The school was concerned about\nYouth A’s weight and tried to “fatten him up” by giving him unhealthy foods that\nwere mostly carbohydrates and junk food. This caused Youth A to be bloated,\nfeel unwell, and have diarrhea. It was unknown at the time if Youth A had any\nallergies or intolerances. Therefore, Foster Parent 1 was determined to figure out\nwhat healthy items he could successfully eat. Youth A’s diet consisted of healthy\ncarbohydrates, proteins, and some fruits/vegetable. When the school continued\nto feed Youth A junk and cause him digestive issues, Foster Parent 1 began\nproviding the school with food. Within the first few months of placement, Youth A\ngained 10lbs.\nYouth A then entered a phase where he was putting things in his mouth, ranging\nfrom other people’s food to non-food items such as crayons. Youth A did not\nhave the ability to regulate feelings of hunger, or feelings of wanting to chew.\nThis also resulted in Youth A trying to swallow large items, vomit, then swallow\nthe item again. Therefore, Foster Parent 1 began giving him very small bites of\nfood. When the regurgitation continued, she began pureeing Youth A’s food. This\nseemed to deter Youth A from intentionally vomiting. Foster Parent 1 continued\nproviding the school with food for Youth A, in puree form. In addition, Youth A\ndrank Ensure 3-5 times per day, to increase his calorie intake.\nFoster Parent 1 reported Youth A was not gaining much weight at her house, but\nhe was not losing weight either and his digestive system seemed to stabilize.\nFoster Parent 1 felt this was a success as long as his weight maintained. Foster\nParent 1 reported Youth A’s doctor was pleased with her strategy and did not\nhave concerns about his low weight, considering his history. Foster Parent 1\nstated agency staff never reported concern about Youth A’s weight.\nFoster Parent 1 stated that Youth A was constantly on the move, which made it\neven more difficult for him to gain weight. Foster Parent 1 denied receiving any\nreferrals for a swallowing test or other specialists. Foster Parent 1 noted that an\nagency worker took Youth A to a medical appointment in August 2021. This\nappointment was with a new doctor. When Foster Parent 1 reviewed the health\nexam form, she found it to be incorrect as it stated Youth A was “normal, average\nsize”. Foster Parent 1 stated that she wished the agency would have been more\nvocal with the doctor in that exam.\n6",
    "Licensing Worker 1\nOn 6/29/22 Licensing Worker 1 reported that her investigation had concluded\nand the agency found Foster Parent 1 in compliance with licensing rules.\nLicensing Worker 1 further stated the agency is reviewing how to better support\nthe needs of children with specialized care.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 801-01 Health Requirements\nPage 3-11\nPage 3- A dental re-examination must be obtained at least every\nsix months unless a greater frequency is indicated.\nPage 9- The caseworker is responsible for reviewing the\ninformation within the child’s well child exam form, the DHS-\n1664, Youth Health Record, Dental form, and other medical,\ndental, and mental health reports and/or assessments. If follow-\nup medical or dental care or mental health treatment is\nrecommended, the caseworker must ensure that the\nrecommendations are followed.\nPage 11-Health services for children with chronic health care\nneeds, such as children identified as medically fragile and/or\nwithin the Children’s Special Health Care Services (CSHCS)\nprogram require ongoing follow-up by the caseworker.\nANALYSIS: Page 3- A violation was found as dental exams were not\ncompleted every six months as required. Exams were missing\nfor July 2020, January 2021, and January 2022.\nPage 9- A violation was found as well-child exams from 2019-\n2021 documented a need for referrals and follow-up regarding\nChild A’s health conditions and a need to closely monitor his\nweight. However, no follow-up was documented.\nPage 11- A violation was found as Youth A is a Medically\nFragile child, with several health conditions. Medical exams\nnoted a need for follow-up and referrals. There was no\ndocumentation to indicate these specialist referrals were\nprovided to the foster parent by the physician. There was also\nno documentation to indicate the worker followed-up with Child\nA's physician regarding his health or medical needs.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n10/27/2021 INTERIM, CAP approved 11/24/2021\n7",
