On\n11/24/19, he said he and four residents were playing “Truth or Dare” in the cottage.\n2",
    "Resident B dared Resident A to “twerk.” Resident A dared Resident B to “bend over.”\nResident M dared Resident A to “pull out his stuff.” After that the boys went outdoors\non the playscape with Staff 1. First, they played “tag.” Then Resident B suggested they\nplay “Truth or Dare” at the top of the slide.\nDuring the game, Resident C said Resident B sucked Resident A’s penis. Resident M\nsucked Resident A’s penis and Resident A sucked Resident B’s penis. Resident C said\nthat Staff 1 was at the opposite end of the playscape, walking around the bench\nlistening to and looking down at his phone when this happened.\nResident M, age 11, was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1 with\nthe Chief Administrator present for support. He would not sit down but chose to stand\nat a distance from the interviewers. Resident M has speech difficulties and smirked\nfrequently.\nResident M said he and some boys were playing “Truth or Dare.” “Resident A told me\nto ‘do whatever.’ I asked if that involved taking down his pants. Resident M smiled and\nresponded “Yes.” “Another kid did it too – Resident B.” I asked what Resident B did.\nResident M answered, “Resident B did what I did.” I asked if that involved private parts.\nResident M grinned “Maybe.” Then Resident M said Resident A “forced me.” Asked\nhow Resident A “forced” him, he could not explain.\nResident M was asked where the staff person was. He said he was sitting on a bench\nfar away and was on his phone the whole time. “It was dark outside,” he added.\nResident B, age 11, was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He\nsaid this is his first out-of-home placement and he has only been at Methodist for two\nweeks.\nResident B was asked about the game of “Truth or Dare.” He downplayed the incident,\nstating “We always play Truth or Dare.” He was asked if anyone was dared to take off\ntheir clothes and he responded, “Yes.” “Resident M did it to Resident A.” Asked to\nclarify, he acknowledged Resident M put his mouth on Resident A’s penis. He added,\n“Resident M keeps saying I did, but Resident M lies about everything. He told Staff 2 I\ndid what he did. I was like, ‘Bro, you’re dumb.’”\nResident B was asked where the staff person was. He stated, “He (Staff 1) didn’t even\nknow (what happened).”\nResident A, age 12, was transferred to Muskegon River Youth Home the day after the\nincident. He was interviewed by Government Worker 2 on 12/3/19. Resident A was\nasked if he ever played outdoors at Methodist. He said he did. He was asked if\nresidents were allowed to play alone or had to be supervised by staff. He stated they\n3",
    "had to be supervised by staff. He was asked where the staff generally are when they\nsupervise residents outdoors. He said the staff sit in chairs, look at their phones and do\nnot pay attention. Resident A was asked if there were any residents at Methodist he did\nnot like. He said he did not like a few, but he did not volunteer names. Resident A was\nasked if he had any problems with Residents B or M. He said he had problems with\nthem because they did something he did not like. He was asked what those residents\ndid. Resident A said it was sometimes \"inappropriate.” He was asked to elaborate, but\nhe refused. Resident A did not want to talk about it. He did say that what Residents B\nand M did, happened on the playscape when a staff person was not paying attention.\nHe did not say who that staff person was.\nResident A also said “it” happened right before he was moved to Muskegon River Youth\nHome and that he did not tell anyone at Methodist about it. Then Resident A told\nGovernment Worker 2 that he was done answering questions and the interview ended.\nResident S, age 13, was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He\nsaid Residents M, B, A and C were playing “Truth or Dare” outdoors on the playscape\non the ledge at the top of the slide “to give each other blow jobs.” “They did it a couple\nof times. Resident M is in a relationship with Resident A.” Asked how he knows\nResidents M and A are “in a relationship,” he said they were talking about it.\nResident S stated specifically that Resident B and M both gave Resident A “blow jobs.”\n“Resident A was pushing Resident M’s head down. Resident M wanted to give\nResident C one on Sunday (two days ago).” I reported the potential “relationship” and\nrecent sexual request to the Chief Administrator for safety and treatment planning\npurposes.\nAsked where the staff person was, Resident S said Staff 1 was talking on his phone.\nStaff 2 and 3 were interviewed separately and collaboratively with Government\nWorker 1. Both staff said that the day after the incident, Resident M, C and S told them\nsimilar accounts of what happened on the playscape.\nStaff 1 was interviewed collaboratively with Government Worker 1. He was placed on\nan administrative leave of absence from Methodist but came in for the interview. Staff 1\nhas worked weekends at the facility for one year. Full-time, he said he teaches history\nand coaches at a charter school.\nGovernment Worker 1 reviewed the allegations with Staff 1. He said he took the\nresidents outdoors to the playscape from 5:45pm to 5:57pm on 11/24/19. “I stood\ndirectly in front of their faces. I was right there less than five feet away.” Staff 1 denied\nbeing distracted from supervising the residents in any way. I asked him what the\nchildren were doing on the playscape. “They were running back and forth…I never\n4",
    "turned my back on them,” he insisted. I asked Staff 1 if he carries a cell phone. He\nsaid he has a cell phone but shuts it off at work.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 The licensee shall have a sufficient number of\nadministrative, supervisory, social service, direct care, and\nother staff to perform the prescribed functions required by\nthese administrative rules and to provide for the needs,\nprotection, and supervision of residents.\nANALYSIS: Outdoors on the playscape between 5pm – 6pm on 11/24/19,\nthere is evidence based on interviews that sexually\ninappropriate behavior occurred between residents. Four of the\nfive residents involved reported that Staff 1 was supposed to be\nsupervising them but instead he stood at a distance from them\ntalking on and/or looking at his phone. The fifth resident\nreported Staff 1 was unaware that anything inappropriate\nhappened.\nStaff 1 did not provide for the needs, protection and supervision\nof the residents.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION:\nOnce an appropriate corrective action plan is received, I recommend this facility\ncontinue its current licensing status.\nDecember 13, 2019\n________________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nDecember 16, 2019\n________________________________________\nLinda Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n5"
