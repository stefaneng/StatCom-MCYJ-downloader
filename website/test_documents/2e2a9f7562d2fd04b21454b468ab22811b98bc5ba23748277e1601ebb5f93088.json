Compliance\nALLEGATION:\nThere are concerns the case worker is not following through with FTM agreements,\nnot being truthful in reporting, and failing to maintain appropriate professional\nboundaries.\nINVESTIGATION:\nA complaint was received on 5/21/20 which stated the following:\nIn regards to Youth A’s case the case progress has been a concern since\nOctober 2019, when mom was evicted from her residence while Youth A was in\nher 10th month of treatment at her residential facility. Mom has struggled to find\nhousing in Grand Rapids and has been living with her adult daughter since then.\nAs of this summary, mom has secured housing, full time employment and has\nachieved nearly 18 months of sobriety. She has met the expectations for a\nparent involved in their child’s treatment at the residential facility, and she has\nmaintained excellent rapport with Youth A’s family therapist throughout the\ntherapists involvement in the case. The therapist began requesting monthly\nfamily team meetings in November 2019, and the case has not moved forward\nto reunification. The following is a summary of concerns that have come up in\nthis case since January 2020.\n Worker 1 did not accurately indicate what services mom and Youth A are\nreceiving during a 1/7/20 court hearing\n Worker 1 struggled to answer basic questions about the case during the\n1/7/20 court hearing\n The residential therapist over heard Worker 1 tell a co-worker, “I’m freaking\nout because I don’t know the answers to the questions they’re asking me\nbecause I don’t know anything that’s going on in this case.”\n On 1/9/20 the residential therapist tried to contact Worker 1 and her\nsupervisor because Youth A was concerned her mother was incarcerated\nhowever Wellspring did not answer or reply.\n Worker 1 has stated in FTM’s that lack of progress on the case has been\ndue to Youth A’s mothers lack of housing and mental health services yet\nYouth A’s mother has restated repeatedly that she is receiving mental\nhealth care and that she sees her final barrier to be housing. In the most\nrecent meeting in February 2020, Worker 1 reported there was a possibility\nYouth A would not be allowed to return to her mother’s care due to the\nlanguage contained in the original court order. Youth A’s mother continues\n3",
    "to report that she feels she is not receiving the support she needs from\nWellspring.\nEmployee File Review: A memo from Worker 1’s employee file was provided on\n5/22/20. The memo dated 2/5/20 stated that in November of 2019 Worker 1 met with\nher supervisor to discuss getting behind on her cases. Worker 1 and her supervisor\ndiscussed solutions for this. One of those solutions was to have weekly check-in’s\nwith her supervisor.\nThe memo also stated in January of 2020 Worker 1 got a co-worker to cover a visit\nfor her because she had to move a youth to residential. She ended up not moving\nbut Worker 1 still did not do the visit. It was also reported that Worker 1 did not\nfollow-up on case items and when it was brought up to Worker 1 by service\nproviders she was defensive and had an excuse as to why she had not done it.\nIt was further discussed that Worker 1 used profane language and connotation when\ntalking about a client while in the halls between the cubicles at the office. It was\nreported that Worker 1 wished ill-will on one of her clients.\nThe memo indicated an improvement plan would be worked on between Worker 1\nand her supervisor.\nFoster Care Supervisor Interview: A video call took place with Worker 1's\nSupervisor on 5/26/20. She stated that Worker 1 is very coachable. She has come a\nlong way since January's court hearing for Youth A. The supervisor said she has had\nconversations with Worker 1 about her anxiety, as Worker 1 gets worked up easily.\nThough she is doing better Worker 1 still has work to do. Worker 1 means well but\nher delivery needs work. Worker 1 was written up on 2/5/20. She said she goes over\nWorker 1's goals every time they meet. She stated Worker 1 is honest. Youth A's\nmom and residential facility are not getting along with Worker 1. The residential talks\nbad about Worker 1 to mom. The supervisor talked to the residential about this and\nasked them to address concerns directly with her and Worker 1.\nThe supervisor stated she was not at the court hearing on 1/7/20 but she sent a\nteam lead to go with Worker 1. Worker 1 had the flu and did not feel well. During\ncourt Worker 1 did say Youth A was in TFCBT but later corrected herself. Worker 1\nwas really flustered and thought she was going to throw up. She did indicate to the\nteam lead that she felt like she did not know the case. The residential therapist\noverheard Worker 1 say this. The therapist said something to Worker 1 about it,\nwhich made Worker 1 even more flustered. The Worker indicated something\nincorrect about mom's therapy, but she said it because she was flustered not\nbecause she did not know. The court clerk informed the supervisor that Worker 1\nwas flustered but that she did fine.\n4",
    "The supervisor stated that Worker 1 was on vacation when mom went to jail. No one\nfrom the residential facility called the supervisor as instructed on Worker 1's out of\noffice message.\nRegarding the case, the supervisor stated that Youth A made more progress than\nmom. Mom does not like Worker 1, so Mom does not communicate well with Worker\n1. Mom missed several drug screens and was not in counseling for a time. Mom is\ncurrently in counseling and has been working with the residential facility on\nparenting. Mom is homeless and lives with her adult daughter. They did get a dual\norder so Youth A can return to mom if mom lives with her adult daughter and has\nFamily Reunification Program (FRP) in the home for 30 days but before FRP can be\nput in place mom needs to move in with daughter. Youth A's lawyer and the judge\nsaid no to an order allowing Youth A to go live with just mom. Mom said she wanted\nto do it at her own home.\nWorker 1 Interview: Worker 1 is the Foster Care Worker for Youth A. She was\ninterviewed on 5/26/20 via video call due to COVID-19. She stated that at the court\nhearing in January she was not feeling well as she had the flu. She was flustered\nand she did end up messing up by saying Youth A was in TFCBT but she corrected\nherself. She also said Youth A's mother was not going to therapy when in fact the\nmom was between therapists at that time. Worker 1 said she knew she was going to\nthrow-up so she went to the bathroom. Her co-worker came into the bathroom with\nher. Worker 1 said she did not know the therapist was in the room until she asked if\nWorker 1 was ok. Worker 1 said if she did say she did not know the case she may\nhave said it out of being sick and flustered as she does know the case.\nWorker 1 said she was on vacation from 1/8/20 -1/15/20 and she turned her phone\noff. She did have an out of office message to contact her supervisor. Worker 1 also\ninformed Youth A's residential placement and the therapist in person that she would\nbe on vacation. She said she notified all providers she would be out of town.\nRegarding the case, Worker 1 said that Youth A's mother was not making progress\nas of January. There was a period of time when she was not in therapy, she did not\nhave housing, and was not communicating with the worker. Now mom is doing\ngreat. She is in therapy, has a full-time job, is living with her adult daughter and has\nan apartment lined up. Mom has missed a few meetings with FRP but she is working\non re-scheduling those. Worker 1 said recently there has not been much\ncommunication with mom. Worker 1 has told mom that she needs to be living with\nher adult daughter and have FRP in place for 30 days in order for Youth A to be\nreturned to her.\nWorker 1 said she meets weekly with her supervisor. Her supervisor helps her make\npriority lists. She said the agency is supportive of her and she can go to her\nsupervisor, other supervisors, or her co-workers for help.\nA message was left for Youth A’s mother, but a return call was never received.\n5",
    "Worker 2: An e-mail was sent to Worker 2 asking her about the court hearing in\nJanuary. She responded by writing: “During the court hearing on 1/07/2020, it was\npretty noticeable when Worker 1 was testifying that she did not feel well and was\ngoing to vomit. When she was testifying, she tried to answer the questions but\nstruggled because she was trying to not get sick. She than looked at the judge and\nasked to be excused because she was going to get sick. She then ran off the stand\nand I followed her. In the bathroom, she was vomiting and became emotional and\nstated she did not feel like she knew the case and was upset because she didn’t\nknow the answers to the questions. She than walked back into the court room and\napologized and said she didn’t feel well. Before she left the stand, the staff member\nfrom the residential facility asked me if she was okay and if she needed help. I asked\nif she meant with clarifying the information or because she was sick and she said\n“Well both, she does not look good”. She than suggested I let the Guadian Ad Litem\n(GAL) know she was sick, but Worker 1 than said something. When I was there, the\nresidential staff did not tell Worker 1 anything about not knowing the case.\nTherapist Interview: Youth A's therapist from her residential facility was interviewed\nvia telephone on 6/4/20. She stated she has been working with Youth A since\nAugust of 2019 and she thought Worker 1 started on Youth A's case in September.\nThe therapist said she does not feel she can trust what Worker 1 says. Youth A's\nmom told her that Worker 1 talks to her about other clients. Mom also told the\ntherapist that she calls Worker 1 and Worker 1 does not call her back. Mom was\ntrying to find housing but Worker 1 was not able to find any resources for her. The\ntherapist stated that there was no movement in the case. Mom was enrolled in\nmental health services the entire time. The therapist said she gets two sides of the\nstory and mom says Worker 1 is not honest. There is a difference between what\nmom says and what Wellspring says. The therapist said mom is participating in\nservices with the residential facility and that mom is open and honest with them.\nWorker 1 told her supervisor that mom and the therapist were talking about her, but\nthey were not.\nRegarding the case, the therapist said that Youth A is nine to ten months past when\nshe should have left the facility. The therapist said that she took her concerns about\nthe case to a team meeting. She said she did not bring up concerns about Worker 1\nherself. The therapist said that FRP is closing because mom is not meeting with\nthem.\nA review of Youth A’s case file in MiSACWIS was completed. In the August 2019\nUpdated Service Plan (USP) Youth A was not ready to return home and mom was\nhaving supervised visits. Mom was starting to participate in the Parent Agency\nTreatment Plan (PATP). She was engaged in therapy but did not have employment\nor housing. The November USP indicates Youth A was having weekend visits at the\nfacility with mom. Mom was staying sober and participating in therapy. Multiple\ncontacts indicate mom and worker called on housing resources, but mom was not\nhaving any luck gaining housing. A contact in the file indicates the court was\n6",
    "contacted on 2/5/20 and reported to the supervisor that Youth A could not return to\nmom under the current court order. Then on 3/25/20 the court order states \"progress\nwas not made\", continue placement but can be placed with mom in sisters home\nwith FRP in place 30 days before return home. Contacts indicated FRP had started\nand the next court hearing was scheduled for June.\nFTM’s were also reviewed. During the FTM from 12/19/19 the team discussed Youth\nA returning home, but Youth A was acting out because she was not seeing a reward\nfor doing good (going home). The 1/28/20 FTM stated mom is working on getting\nhousing. Mom is compliant with other services. They discussed a possible discharge\nfor March. The 4/28/20 FTM stated the team was prepping Youth A to go home as\nmom has housing. Discharge was discussed for May.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nFOM 722-06 Case Planning\nSupervising Agency Requirements\nReasonable efforts must be made by the supervising agency.\nThe services offered and/or provided are considered reasonable\nefforts and must be recorded in the case service plan and the\nparent-agency treatment plan and service agreement; see FOM\n722-08C, Parent-Agency Treatment Plan and Service\nAgreement.\nANALYSIS: In reviewing the case file and talking to Worker 1 there is no\nindication that worker 1 has not been following-up with providing\nservices to mom. Contacts indicate the worker has been in\ncontact with housing service providers and with mom to provide\nher with resources. Mom could not be reached to dispute this.\nFurther there is no indication that Worker 1’s conduct at the\ncourt hearing on 1/7/20 caused reasonable efforts not to be\nmade in this case. All case documents indicate it was mom’s\nlack of housing that was keeping Youth A in residential.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe caseworker is failing to maintain appropriate boundaries.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the above complaint the following was alleged:\n7",
    " The therapist stated that on 5/19/20 Worker 1 was scheduled for a video visit\nwith Youth A. Prior to Youth A getting on the call Worker 1 was applying\nessential oils and disclosed that she was recently diagnoses with anxiety and\ndepression. Worker 1 stated she was afraid to take medication and that is\nwhy she was applying the oils. She then started talking about having a panic\nattack the last time she visited with Youth A in person on 3/19/20.\n Other concerns throughout the case include mom’s repeated statements that\nshe is not getting the support she needs from Wellspring and that Worker 1\nhad demonstrated poor professional boundaries with her. Mom reported that\nWorker 1 openly complained about other clients in front of her and had\ndemonstrably declined their calls while transporting mom to appointments.\nMom also stated that Worker 1 talks to her about her (Worker 1’s) romantic\nand family problems, needing to take mental health days, and complaining\nabout her heavy caseload.\nAs indicated above Worker 1 had previously been written up for stating that she\nwished ill will on one of her clients, specifically that they would be harmed.\nFoster Care Supervisor Interview: During her interview the supervisor stated she\nhad a conversation with Worker 1 about self-disclosure. Worker 1 admitted she did\nsay the things the therapist reported. The supervisor said Worker 1 needs additional\ntraining on boundaries and self-disclosure. Worker 1 was written up on 2/5/20 for\ntalking poorly about clients.\nWorker 1 Interview: During her interview, Worker 1 was asked about her video visit\nwith Youth A on 5/19/20. She stated she talked to the therapist first. The therapist\nasked if Worker 1 was ok and Worker 1 told her she was dealing with anxiety and\nshe was worried about taking medication for it. Worker 1 said her supervisor\naddressed this issue with her. Worker 1 said she had a panic attack after seeing\nYouth A, not during the visit. Worker 1 said she went to the doctor and they said it\nwas a panic attack.\nWorker 1 stated she has never complained about her clients in front of Youth A's\nmom. All she has said is that there are other clients who go through the same\ndifficulties as her (mom). Worker 1 said she has talked about her personal life with\nYouth A's mom and she would try to relate to her clients by saying she has been\nthrough some of the things they have been through. She recognizes now she\ncrossed a boundary. She said she has told mom that she may not get back to her in\ntime because she is helping other families.\nTherapist Interview: During her interview the therapist said Worker 1 was detailing\nher mental health in a conversation with her. She said Youth A was not present for\nthe conversation. She said she was in the office and Worker 1 was at home. They\nstarted the call by the two of them talking. Worker 1 talked about her having a panic\nattack the last time Worker 1 met with Youth A. In January they had a review hearing\nand Worker 1 was struggling. She messed up on Youth A's age and grade. The\n8",
    "Therapist looked at mom who was shaking her head about what Worker 1 was\nsaying. Worker 1 also did not give the correct information about Youth A's treatment.\nWorker 1 was just trying to get through the hearing. Worker 1 left to go to the\nbathroom. The therapist went to check on Worker 1 and Worker 1 was upset and\nyelling that she did not know the case.\nThe Code of Conduct Policy for the agency was reviewed. The policy states that\n“Employees and agents are expected to conform to the standards of their respective\nprofessionals and exercise sound judgement in the performance of their duties…”\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12202 Policy and procedures.\n(1) An agency shall have and follow written policies and\nprocedures for all of the following:\n(d) Staff qualifications.\nANALYSIS: The agency’s Code of Conduct Policy states employees are to\nexercise sound judgement. Worker 1 did not do that when, as\nreported by the therapist and Worker 1, she disclosed personal\ninformation about herself to service providers and clients.\nAdditionally she was written up for wishing ill will on one of her\nclients.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nUpon acceptance of a corrective action plan it is recommended that this\ninvestigation be closed with no further licensing action.\n7/28/20\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 30, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n9",
