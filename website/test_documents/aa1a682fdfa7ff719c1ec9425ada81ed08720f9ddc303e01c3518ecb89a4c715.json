    " Extra staff should be scheduled on campus in order to help when there is a\ncrisis. This would allow better supervision of the residents when there is a\ncrisis on campus and staff are pulled away from the house they are assigned\nto.\n A clinical supervisor or manager needs to be hired to provide clinical oversight\nand supervision.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation at this time.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThe facility has submitted eight acceptable corrective action plans not related\nto maltreatment during this licensing period.\nSpecial Investigation 2019C0103043 was initiated when it was reported that a\nresident was hurt by a staff member. There was no indication that the staff harmed\nthe resident. However, a restraint was done but the staff did not complete a Restraint\nReport. The facility was found in violation of R 400.4159 Resident restraint and a\nCorrective Action Plan (CAP) which appropriately addressed the violations was\naccepted on 10/9/19.\nSpecial Investigation 2019C0103051 was initiated when it was reported that staff\ndragged a youth on the ground during a restraint. The facility was found in violation of\nR 400.4159 Resident restraint and a CAP was accepted on 10/29/19.\nSpecial Investigation 2019C0103055 was initiated when it was reported that a staff\nmember picked up a youth and transported him outside. The facility was found in\nviolation of R 400.4159 Resident restraint and a CAP was accepted on 12/3/19.\nSpecial Investigation 2020C0103007 was initiated when it was reported that a staff\nmember put her hands around a youth’s neck while the youth was in a restraint. The\nfacility was found in violation of R 400.4159 Resident restraint with a CAP accepted\non 1/13/20.\nSpecial Investigation 2020C0103010 was initiated when it was reported that a staff\nmember pushed a child in the chest and caused a bruise. It was found that the staff\ndid not intentionally harm the youth. The facility was found in violation of R 400.4150\nIncident reporting due to staff not reporting the youth’s runaway to the consultant. A\nCAP was accepted on 3/17/20.\n4",
    "Special Investigation 2020C0103012 was initiated when it was reported that three\nresidents were not allowed to return to the house after being AWOL during a winter\nstorm. The facility was found in violation of R 400.4158 Discipline for denial of shelter\nand R 400.4109 Program statement for not following the facility’s runaway policy and\nYouth Development Specialist expectations. A CAP was accepted on 4/13/20.\nSpecial Investigation 2020C0223021 was initiated when it was reported that a staff\nutilized an unapproved hold. The facility was found in violation of R 400.4159\nResident restraint for the improper hold and for not completing a restraint report. A\nCAP was accepted on 4/17/20.\nSpecial Investigation 2020C0223022 was initiated when it was reported that residents\nwere able to gain access to the med cart. The facility was found in violation of R\n400.4126 Sufficiency of staff for not having enough staff to deal with the behaviors of\nthe youth and R 400.4142 Health services for not having the medication double\nlocked as indicated in their policy. A CAP was accepted on 4/28/20.\nThe facility has had many violations this review period and several of those violations\nare repeat violations. Within this last year the facility has had three different Chief\nAdministrators and a significant amount of staff turnover. This, along with a delay in\nstaff hiring due to a lack of Human Resource staff, led to a shortage of well-trained\nstaff within the program. Despite the facility coming up with a plan to address the\nstaff issue there continues to be a shortage of not only management staff but also\nextra staff on campus to help when a crisis arises. This lack of staffing has led to\nsignificant safety issues on campus. The facility currently has a safety plan in place\nwhich utilizes senior managers to provide support to the houses during times of need.\nThis safety plan however is only a temporary fix as more supervisors and/or\nmanagers need to be in each house to provide the support needed. Additionally, the\nstaff and management turnover has led to newer staff being inadequately trained to\ndeal with the behaviors of the youth served by the facility. A plan was put into place\nthat would have the facility trainer providing in the moment coaching to the staff in the\nhouses. Having additional supervisors or managers in the houses will also help with\ntraining new staff.\nAround the time this inspection was completed the short-term assessment program\n(STEP) contract was being closed. At the time of this report that program has been\nclosed and the house is no longer in use. After the inspection findings were provided\nto the facility management team it was reported that the reports from STEP received\nfor the inspection were inaccurately dated. It was reported that the program manager\nhad falsified the date of the reports, but their report tracking system indicated those\nreports were late. The management team provided the actual dates of the reports and\nstated that the program manager for STEP was terminated in part due to this issue.\n5",
    "VII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or ISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of an\nacceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility be issued a first\nprovisional license, as recommended in Special Investigation 2020C0223043.\n6/30/20\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Garnaat Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 11, 2020\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n6"
