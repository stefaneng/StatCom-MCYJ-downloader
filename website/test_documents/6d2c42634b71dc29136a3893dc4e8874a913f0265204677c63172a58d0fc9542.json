    "safety concerns. The relative indicated her bedroom was off limits and has never been\nviewed by the agency.\nResolution:\nThe agency’s licensing department reported it had completed a home visit with the\nrelative on 11/11/2021 for the purpose of completing a 3130A and the licensing worker\nviewed the relative’s bedroom during a tour of the home for completing the 3130A.\nThere were no home concerns noted in the 3130A. The agency reported the licensure\nprocess has since closed due to the relative’s lack of participation in the process and\ndesire not to be licensed. The agency’s foster care worker (FCW) had visited the home\non 4/21/22; and met with the child in his bedroom. The relative disclosed to the FCW\nthat she did not let the Analyst into the home because she has a hole in the roof that is\nlocated in an unused bedroom (the agency attached photos to the safety alert showing\nthe holes). A Safety Plan was created with the relative that no household members will\nuse this bedroom until repairs are made. The relative was seeking quotes from a\ncontractor so that resources could be secured for fixing the roof.\nSafety Alert #2 received on 5/6/2022.\nConcern:\nThe child placed in the home does not have a bed. The child placed in the home is\ncurrently residing across the street with a relative. There are concerns regarding why\nthe child is not residing in her current placement full-time.\nResolution:\nA safety plan has been put in place and signed by the relative/foster parent and her\ndaughter/substitute caregiver across the street. The plan states that the child will sleep\nin her room at the foster home a minimum of five nights per week and can spend the\nnight in the home of the relative substitute care provider up to two nights per week. Any\nadditional overnights must to approved by foster care. The plan will be monitored by the\nfoster care worker and both relatives during monthly foster home visits. The\nrelative/foster parent reported on 5/11/2022 that she lied to the Analyst because she\ndidn’t want anyone in her business anymore. She said the bed was not taken across the\nstreet; it was moved upstairs while the bedroom was being painted. The bed has since\nbeen moved back into the child's bedroom and assembled (a photo was included by the\nagency showing the bed in the bedroom). A special investigation was already underway\nfor the relative/foster parent for previous allegations; and additional finding of insufficient\nbedding was being included in the ongoing investigation (2022C0630519).\nSafety Alert # 3 received:5/13/2022:\nConcern:\nAll of the rooms in the home were not viewed. The relative did not allow a visit to her\nbedroom or the basement.\nResolution:\n18",
    "The agency foster care worker and supervisor visited the relatives’ home on 5/13/22 to\ncomplete a safety inspection; and discussed issues of the Safety Alert. They\nencouraged the relative to contact the agency when in doubt about who is authorized to\ncome into the home. The agency staff viewed the bedrooms in the home. The couple\ncurrently are not sleeping in their bedroom; they sleep in the living room. Their\nbedroom, which contains a queen size bed, is currently used for storage of boxes and\nother items. The room is kept locked. There is another bedroom that is not occupied by\nany family members; and it is currently being used to store items that belonged to the\nrelatives’ deceased daughter. A third bedroom is being used by the three boys. A fourth\nbedroom is occupied by their sister.\nThe relatives’ basement was also viewed during the agency’s 5/13/2022 home visit. The\nbasement is only used as storage for items (e.g., Toys & bikes) that mostly belong to\nthe children. There were no concerns noted in the basement. The agency provided\nphotos of the basement. The agency is encouraged to work with the relatives around,\nstorage issues, so that they can all utilized their bedrooms for sleeping.\nConcern:\nPlease ensure safety precautions are being used for the outdoor pool.This was not\nverified due to the basement door being locked.\nResolution:\nThe pool area in the backyard was viewed during the agency’s 5/13/2022 home visit.\nThe backyard contains an above ground pool with a fence around it with three\nentrances. The entrances are secured with locks. The children are reported to not be\nallowed into the area without adult supervision. The pool has not yet been prepared for\nthe season. The agency provided photos showing the pool, its fence around, and\nsecurity locks.\nVI. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes, rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon\nreceipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will\nbe issued a renewal of their regular license.\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date: May 17, 2022\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n19",
