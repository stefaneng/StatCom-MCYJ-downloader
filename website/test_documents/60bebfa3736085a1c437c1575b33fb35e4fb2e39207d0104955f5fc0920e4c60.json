A corrective action plan is required.\nThis renewal inspection found that in the records reviewed the agency was\ncompliant with this requirement.\nVII. DCWL Analyst Concerns\nThe information contained in the DCWL analyst’s (1/31/18) report was collected\nthrough the interviews of randomly selected families that were working with Tuscola\nDHHS between the dates of 11/29/17 – 1/24/18. The following came up as a concerns\nduring these interviews. This consultant reviewed all related records and interviewed\nassigned case managers and supervisors to address all concerns.\nConcern:\nA foster parent doesn’t have a medical passport for the children that are currently\nplaced in the foster home. At the time of the home visit, the children had been in the\nhome for one week.\nResolution:\nA review of the records and interview with the assigned case manager determined that\n3 of the four children in this home did not have a medical passsport. These children\nwere subsequently replaced. The assigned case manager provided the new foster\nparent with medical passports the 3 children.\nConcern:\nAn unlicensed relative family has two foster youth in the home. The children are\nsleeping on mattresses on the floor.\nResolution:\nThe foster care records were reviewed and interviewes were conducted the the\nassigned case manager and supervisor. This concern could not be verified and the\nchildren were subsequently replaced.\nConcern:\nThree birth parents indicated they aren’t allowed to take part in decisions which involves\ntheir children's educational and medical needs and physical appearance.\nResolution:\nA review of the children’s records and interviews with the assigned case manager did\nnot verify this complaint. This consultant did cite the agency for not clearly documenting\n9",
    "that two of the birth parents were engaged in the development of their initial service\nplans.\nConcern:\nOne birth parent reported she isn’t familiar with the case service plan. This same parent\nalso indicated that she doesn’t receive proper notification of court hearings.\nResolution:\nAs indicated above the agency did not clearly document that two of three birth parents\nwere engaged in the development of their initial service plans. One parent’s complaint\nthat she didn’t recevie proper notification of court hearings was not verified.\nConcern:\nA birth parent reported he hasn’t received financial assistance or information regarding\navailable resources for housing. The parent stated the agency is requesting him to\nobtain stable housing, but they will not provide any assistance with this goal. The\nparent also informed that it took the agency 3-4 month's to schedule parenting time with\nhis children.\nResolution:\nInterviews were conducted with the assigned case manager and supervisor. The foster\ncare record was reviewed. This consultant cited the agency related to this case for not\nclearly documenting the engagement of the birth parent in the development of his initial\nservice plan. The birth father’s engagment was documented in later service plans by\nthe assigned case manager.\nConcern:\nOne unlicensed relative family has a bedroom in their basement. The basement does\nnot have an egress windows.\nConcern:\nThe family reported to the analyst they have a waiver and have no intention to become\nlicensed.
