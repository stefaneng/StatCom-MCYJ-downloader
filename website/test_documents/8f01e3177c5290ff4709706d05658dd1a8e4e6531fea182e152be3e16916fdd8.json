The Foster Care Worker\n(FCW) indicated something to the effect that they intentionally did not document a\nneed for one-to-one supervision on the youth’s CCI intake paperwork because “we\nknow everyone will turn her down and won’t take her”.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 9/22/2022 I spoke with CCI facility Director 1 by telephone. I also spoke with\nDirector 2 by telephone this same date. Both Directors reported the agency\nreceived information on Youth A from DHHS-NC prior to Youth A’s placement at the\nfacility. They reported a third facility person, CCI Staff 3 would have copies of those\ndocuments.\nDirector 1\nDirector 1 reported Youth A is in placement with their CCI facility (CCI X). Youth A\nwas placed with CCI X from the Detroit Behavior Institute (DBI) agency after DBI\nclosed. Director 1 reported they requested Youth A’s removal from their program via\na 30-day removal because Youth A’s needs are outside of their agency’s placement\ncapabilities. They requested an FTM with DHHS because of Youth A’s ongoing\nbehaviors; and they wanted to check in on the 30-day removal request submitted to\n3",
    "DHHS. The FTM occurred via TEAMs and Director 1 reported being on the TEAMs\ncall. During the TEAMs discussion about Youth A, Director 1 reported bringing up\nthat their agency was not fully aware all of Youth A’s issues. A DHHS-NC staff\nmembers responded with a comment something to the effect that “I do not think we\nput on the paperwork that she needed 1:1 supervision; I don’t think we should put on\nthat she needs 1:1 because that will limit our ability to get a placement”. Director 1\ndid not know which DHHS-NC staff person made the comment, but she did not\nbelieve it was Youth A’s FCW. She reported there being 12 people on the TEAMs\ncall. Director 1 reported being frustrated by that comment; but reported someone\nelse stated that was not a wise recommendation. Director 1 expressed concern that\nDHHS-NC’s possible lack of transparency may be the reason Youth A is being\nbounced around in placements.\nDirector 2\nDirector 2 reported being on two different FTM/RPU (Residential Placement Unit)\nmeetings scheduled by DHHS-NC, 9/6/2022 and 9/16/2022. Director 2 was not\ncertain of all of the DHHS staff members on the FTM calls. On 9/27/2022 she\nprovided me a copy of the TEAMs invite that listed the members invited/included.\nShe reported those members were included/invited for both meetings.\nDirector 2 reported Youth A’s placement needs and behaviors were discussed at\nboth meetings. Director 2 reported Youth A’s FCW did not make the comment that\nwas indicated in the complaint. Nor did Director 2 recall any DHHS-NC staff person\nmaking such a statement or comment. Director 2 said she only recalled someone\nsaying something like “It a catch 22” situation; that they want to provide residential\nfacilities with all information about Youth A’s behaviors but doing so presents\nplacement barriers. One of the DHHS-NC staff, whom Director 2 did not know, said\nthey know Youth A has all these behaviors, but with the mention of these behaviors,\na lot of people will turn Youth A down. Director 2 recalled someone from CCI X\nsaying that there are behaviors that Youth A has that were not put in the referral.\nDirector 2 did not recall a DHHS-NC staff person response to that comment from her\nagency; but she stated she did not feel DHHS-NC “intentionally left anything out of\nthe paperwork.”\nCCI Staff 3\nOn 9/27/2022 I interviewed CCI Staff 3 by telephone. She recalled FTM meetings\nwith DHHS-NC staff as 9/9/2022 and 9/16/2022. With the latter TEAM’s meeting\nbeing the one whereby the youth’s behavior and statement over one-one supervision\ncame up. She affirmed Director 1’s reporting related to the purpose of the FTM\nmeeting. And that she, Director 1 and Director 2 attended the TEAM’s meeting from\nCCI X. She reported Supervisor B, Specialist D, Supervisor E and Manager F and\nManager G were on the call from DHHS-NC. She said FCW C was not in attendance\nor had not been in attendance in its entirety. CCI Staff 3 reported that Supervisor B\ndid most of the talking from DHHS-NC’s end, with Specialist D sometimes\ncommenting also.\n4",
    "CCI Staff 3 reported during the meeting CCI X expressed concern with Youth A’s\nescalating behaviors, and DHHS-NC indicated other agencies were denying\nplacement of Youth A due to those behaviors. CCI Staff 3 reported their staff\nexpressed their appreciation for the department’s difficulties in trying to secure a\nplacement but reiterated that Youth A’s 30-days were up; CCI X not being equipped\nto handle Youth A’s behaviors; that Youth A requires a more secure program. CCI\nStaff 3 reported at some point a DHHS-NC staff (CCI Staff 3 did not know who)\nasked them whether they could do 1:1 supervision with Youth A; and they explained\nthey could not and would not be able to provide that degree of services. Director 2\nasked whether DHHS-NC could provide staff to aid in providing the 1:1 staff, and\nSupervisor B stated that they did not have the staff to do that. CCI Staff 3 said\nSpecialist D and Supervisor E interjected and repeated what Supervisor B stated\nabout the 1:1.\nCCI Staff 3 advised that during the meeting they were trying to get across what was\nhappening with Youth A, and that Youth A’s behaviors warranted the extra attention\nand that other agencies being explored for placement for Youth A needed to know\nthat. CCI Staff 3 reported it was at that point that Supervisor B stated, “We are not\nputting that down”. CCI Staff 3 was not sure if “We are not putting that down” meant\nSupervisor B would not put in a referral that Youth A needed 1:1 supervision or\nsomething different. CCI Staff 3 reported when Supervisor B made that statement,\nSupervisor B and other DHHS-NC staff were talking amongst themselves. She\nreported it was then that Director 1 interjected and indicated to DHHS-NC that the\ndepartment needs to be transparent about Youth A's issues and behaviors, that this\nmight be why Youth A passes from placement to placement. CCI Staff 3 said\nDHHS-NC did not reply back to Director 1 but asked them about taking Youth A to\nthe hospital when episodes occur, and thereon, their meeting discussion centered\naround that.\nI asked CCI Staff 3 whether Youth A’s extensive behaviors and needs were\nindicated on the referral/package of documentation provided to CCI X from DHHS-\nC. CCI Staff 3 admitted to getting lots of file documents on Youth A. She/CCI X\nprovided me a copy of the documents on 9/27/2022. CCI Staff 3 also advised they\ntook Youth A from DBI, and some of the paper work they received on Youth A\nincluded documents from that facility. She reported when FCW C dropped Youth A\noff, FCW C reported just getting Youth A’s case; and did not know much about her at\nthat time.\nDHHS-NC onsite agency visit\nOn 10/4/2022 I made an onsite DHHS-NC agency visit at which time I interviewed\nSupervisor B and FCW 3. Both of these staff persons acknowledged a TEAM’s\nmeeting with CCI X staff on 9/16/2022 related to placement and behavioral issues\nfor Youth A.. Both of these staff persons reported 1:1 supervision was something\nthey had offered CCI X multiple times. Both also denied the allegations.\n5",
    "• Supervisor B reported being present for the entirety of the meeting, and to\nFCW C coming in and out of the meeting. She affirmed, Supervisor E’s,\nManager F’s and Manager G’s attendance on the calls, as well as Manager\nH’s. She admitted there was discussion about 1:1 supervision for Youth A’s\nbehaviors, as well as, around the agency’s utilizing the hospital, as needed\nrelated to mental health issues. She also reported there had been\ndiscussion with the agency around Youth A’s placement at DBI and how\nYouth A was not on 1:1 supervision at that facility. She reported information\nrelated to Youth A’s behaviors would have been provided to CCI X by RPU\nprior to Youth A’s placement at CCI X. Supervisor B denied anyone\nindicating to the agency during the meeting that there would not be full\ndisclosure to referral agencies around Youth A’s behavior. She admitted a\nstatement was made by Specialist D that if 1:1 supervision is placed on the\nreferral they would not find many placements because not many agencies\ncan take a youth needing 1:1 supervision. Supervisor B reported Specialist\nD’s statement was made in relation to Specialist D trying to be strength-based\nby explaining to the agency that Youth A’s strengths would be highlighted; not\nthat negative behaviors would not be documented via her referral\ndocumentation. Supervisor B denied herself or anyone saying we are not\nputting that down related to behaviors and needs for Youth A.\n• Foster Care Worker (FCW) C affirmed being the current FCW for Youth A.\nShe reported the TEAM’s meeting on 9/16/2022 was one of DHHS-NC’s\ncheck ins with CCI X due to behaviors being reported by CCI X for Youth A,\nand the agency’s request for Youth A’s replacement. FCW C affirmed not\nbeing in attendance for the entire meeting; but denied ever hearing anyone\nstate they would intentionally not put on referral paper work that Youth A\nneeds 1:1 supervision. FCW C reported DHHS-NC has had outside\ndiscussions around the possible damage to Youth A’s placement chances if\nthat type of information is on referral package paperwork. She advised that\nwas due to the fact it’s not certain Youth A needs 1:1 supervision; because\nalthough CCI X reports Youth A needs 1:1 supervision, another agency may\nbe able to meet Youth A’s need without that level of supervision.\nSpecialist D\nOn 10/17/2022 I interviewed Specialist D via TEAMs on 10/17/2022 in the presence\nof her supervisor, Supervisor E who was present as a support person to Specialist\nD. Both staff persons acknowledged being on the 9/16/2022 TEAM’s call/meeting\nwith CCI X.\nSpecialist D denied the allegations. She reported there was a lot of frustration on the\ncall from CCI X; and CCI X was not happy with some of DHHS-NC answers. She\nreported DHHS-NC were not saying to CCI X that DHHS-NC would not be putting\ninto their referral all of Youth A’s negative behaviors issues and needs. The concern\nwas that “we wanted to put in strengths” for Youth A (which CCI X could not list one)\nso that that would help in securing Youth A a placement. Specialist D advised that\n6",
    "in referring Youth A/any youth for residential placement they would include that\ninformation. She said they would also provide a summary statement. She reported\nthe summary statement is intended to be a brief and quick introduction to the youth,\nnot a complete detail of the youth’s needs or issues. She reported that would be so\nthat the residential agency can review the document package, which includes\ndocuments provided from the past placements, and any possible agency can “make\nthe call and decide if they can meet/service” Youth A needs.\nReviewed:\nYouth A’s MISACWIS case record on 9/22/2022 which showed:\n• She came into care in August 2018. She is a permanent court ward.\n• She was placed at CCI X on 7/7/2022; and discharged 10/9/2022.\n• She has had numerous residential and hospital placements in the past.\n• Her specialized diagnoses included Post Traumatic Stress Disorder-Chronic,\nand Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, physical and sexual abuse and\nsubstance abuse.\n• Her last psychiatric evaluation at the time was from DBI dated 3/24/2022.\nDHHS-1105 for 9/16/2022 Team meeting.\nA 9/27/2022 email from CCI X with copies of the referral documents they reported\nreceiving from DHHS-NC on Youth A, outside of the 3600-placement authorization\nand consent paperwork:\n• Adoption Recruitment Readiness Assessment Monthly Report for 6/9/2022.\n• A Children’s Traumatic Assessment Report dated 3/27/2019.\n• A psychotropic medication informed consent document dated 11/23/2021 that\nlisted medications Youth A had been prescribed.\n• A DBI 3/24/2022 psychiatric evaluation report, that defined various diagnoses\nas listed in this review section.\n• Various incident reports from DBI that documented incidents of Youth A\nfighting and physically assaulting her peers.\n• An IEP Team’s report.\n• A 4/21/2022 medication review.\n• The Removal petition.\n• A 1/29/2022-4/28/2022 Updated service plan and treatment plan for Youth A\nthat documented:\n➢ Diagnoses for Youth A, inclusive of nocturnal enuresis, learning\ndifficulties, past abuses, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder.\n➢ Past Juvenile Detention Facility admission after a 1/19/2022 physical\naggression toward staff and property destruction.\nA 10/27/2022 email from Specialist D was received outlining the summary statement\nthat she includes along with the documents’ package. The latter of which she\nindicated includes the initial service plans, updated service plans, incident reports,\ntrauma assessment, maximus assessment, medication and educational information,\n7",
    "etc., that is sent to RPU when the county makes the referral in searching for a\nresidential placement for Youth A. She reported their unit adds or deletes items with\neach new referral depending on updated information received from the current\nplacement at the time of the referral. Specialist D reported the summary is intended\nto be a brief and quick introduction to the youth, not a complete detail of the youth’s\nneeds or issues. The summary statement she sent out with the document package\nwas as follows:\n• RPU is searching for a residential for:\n• Youth A, 14-year-old female out of Wayne County. Youth A is an MCI ward.\n• Youth A is described as extremely resilient and is able to advocate for herself\nand bounce back quickly from adversity. Youth A enjoys dancing a lot per her\nteam.\n• Youth A is said to be very sweet and easy to talk with. It is said that when\nshe is de-escalated she is very easily redirected. Youth A is able to advocate\nfor herself. She enjoys shopping and listening to music.\n• Youth A has an uncle out of state that is willing to take placement of her. The\nICPC (Interstate compact on the placement of children) is submitted, and the\ncounty is waiting to hear back regarding the updates.\n• Youth A is diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder. Youth A is currently at\nHoly Cross Residential, and they are asking for her to be removed. Holy\nCross stated that Youth A’s behaviors included destruction of property, verbal\nand physical aggression, AWOLing, and displaying sexual behaviors with\nother peers.\n• It is to be noted that since being in residential Youth A is starting to feel\nhopeless about the move to her uncle’s home. The county and residential\nagency feel Youth A is getting anxious and is showing it through her actions.\nIt is noteworthy, as indicated above that included with this RPU summary statement are\ndocuments from the youth’s past placements, inclusive of service plans, psychological\nreports, medication and education information, behavior and incident reports from Youth\nA’s prior placements and current placement agency.\n8",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.12207 Staff responsibilities.\n(3) An agency shall require that social service workers be\ndirectly responsible for all of the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.\nSocial service workers shall work directly with the\nchildren, their families, and other relevant individuals\nand be primarily responsible for the development,\nimplementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nANALYSIS: Based on interviews there is insufficient evidence to support the\nallegation; or of the department not providing factual information\nand documentation of Youth A behaviors and needs. Nor that\nthe agency workers did not work directly with other relevant\nindividuals for the development and implementation of the\nservice plan for the Youth A.\nTechnical assistance\nThe agency is apprised that its summary statement of Youth A\nthough reported to be designed to be strength-based, and a\nquick introduction to the youth, does not fully encompass the\nextend of Youth A’s special needs. The statement as outline\nmight be viewed as the agency not being fully transparent about\nthe youth’s over-all issues. The summary must also be more\nreflective of the youths’ limitations/overall needs.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that no change be made to the license of this child placing\nagency.\nFebruary 6, 2023\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\n9",
