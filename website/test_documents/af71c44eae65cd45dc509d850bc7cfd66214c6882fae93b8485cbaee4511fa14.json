Restraint was not uploaded to\nMiSACWIS for 8/20/21. Appropriate review of restraints is not occurring by the\nfacility. There are concerns related to the justification for the restraint.\n3",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 08/25/21 after information was received by DCWL\nalleging possible rule and contract noncompliances.\nIn an email from Youth A’s worker on 08/25/21, the worker reported a number of\nconcerns with the facility. The following summarizes the email from Youth A’s\nworker. The worker reported that Youth A was involved in an incident where he\naccessed inappropriate pornography websites via the new onsite school program’s\ntablet on Thursday, 08/19/21. The worker said that the therapist told her that the\nnext day, 08/20/21, Youth A was in an altercation with a peer. The worker said that\nbased on the incident report she received, the incident with the peer occurred on\n8/23/21. The worker said that she reviewed the report with Youth A who provided his\naccount of what occurred. The youth reportedly told his worker the following:\nHe was watching TV and had a cup of water in his hand. The other youth tried to\nscare him from behind and it caused Youth A to spill his water on him. He stated\nthat he got up and threw the rest of the water on the kid and was walking to his\nroom to get paper towels and he jokingly hit the kid with a notebook and was\nlaughing about the incident. The other peer didn’t think it was funny and punched\nhim in the side of the head on the right side. He also said that both him and the\nother youth threw chairs at each other but did not make impact. No marks or\nswelling. He was seen by the nurse and no meds or treatment was needed.\nYouth A’s worker went on to note that Youth A’s consequence for accessing the\npornography was to take away his library privileges which upset him because\nreading is his number one coping skill. Reportedly, the facility took all of the books\nthat the worker and Youth A’s court advocate purchased him away and only let him\nhave one book that was in the unit. It was also reported that Youth A was banned\nfrom the gym due to the incident with the peer and the IPad.\nYouth A’s worker added that he told her that on 8/24/2021, Youth A was upset again\nthat he could not go to the library, and he said:\nStaff was “taunting him” about not being able to get books and it upset him so he\nthrew a chair and a trash can. He said that he sat down at the table to calm down\nand Facility Manger 1 (FM1) was in his face telling him to calm down and trying\nto get him to tell him why he was mad and Youth A stated that he asked him two\ntimes to back up and let him calm down and FM1 didn’t do that so he threw the\nmayonnaise in his face. He said FM1 instantly put him in a physical restraint and\ntold him to calm down. Youth A stated that he calmed down and went to his\nroom. He said that he was checked out by the nurse and no treatment was\nnecessary.\nThe worker stated that she received an email from the Therapist on 08/23/21 and\nalso received a voice message from someone at the facility (did not leave a name)\n4",
    "notifying her of the restraint. The worker said that she tried to call Lincoln Center and\nwas told by whoever answered the phone that Youth A is not able to have phone\ncalls. The worker said that she explained that she is his worker and that they can’t\nrefuse to allow her contact to Youth A. The staff reportedly told the worker to call\nback the next day and talk to his therapist/case manager and hung up on the worker.\nThe worker said that she called back, and it went to voicemail. The worker said that\nshe also contacted Youth A’s attorney, who also tried to call, and they sent him to\nvoicemail. Youth A’s worker then said she emailed his case manager and asked for\na phone call and was able to speak to Youth A on 08/24/21, but his case manager\nwas present, and he was not able to talk freely. The worker said that Youth A had\ntold her prior that he is afraid to talk because he doesn’t want retaliation. Youth A’s\nworker said that she told the case manager about her attempted phone contact with\nYouth A the night prior and was told that youth can’t have contact for 48 hours after\nan incident and that she was not sure who was working when the worker tried to call.\nThe worker said that Youth A stated that they are not able to call their workers or\nattorneys without a therapist present. The worker said that she reiterated that Youth\nA should be able to contact his attorney or worker if he needs to talk to them and\nshe again stated it is only when a therapist is available. The worker said this was not\nthe first time she experienced this and that she went to the facility to speak directly\nwith Youth A in that instance.\nThe worker added that she met with Youth A on 08/25/21 and Youth A reported:\nThey are short staffed and not getting their group services (anger management\nor sexual reactive programming) and that sometimes they don’t get their weekly\ntherapy if their therapist is gone (Therapist). He reported that he has not heard or\nseen anything that has occurred in other units because they are not allowed to\ntalk or look at others in the other units, but he reported that in his unit, staff and\npeers get along for the most part, very few incidents occur, but a Supervisor\ninstigates a lot of verbal disagreements in the unit. Youth A didn’t go into detail\nabout how often, but it mainly focuses on telling the youth that they have to share\ntheir thoughts with each other and some of the youth do not like to share and it\ncauses a disruption but not like the referral stated about staff being physical with\nthem.\nHe reported that he does feel safe in his pod and that his entire pod just stays\naway from the other pods because they get into a lot of trouble and they have\ntheir own issues in their pod they don’t need other people’s issues. Youth A was\nadvised of his right to file a grievance if he feels his rights are being violated or if\nhe tries to call me or his attorney and they refuse. He stated that they are not\nallowed to file them and that the grievance box has been down for months. He\nstated that a youth that was there previously kicked it off the wall and they put in\nthe closet and never hung it back up. He is looking forward to finishing his\nprogram and getting out of Lincoln Center.\n5",
    "The worker added that she will not be violating Youth A on his probation. The worker\nsaid that she thinks there is a lot of information missing in the incident reports and it\nappears that Youth A has taken responsibility and was able to identify what\nhappened, what he could have or should have done, so she didn’t feel a violation\nwas warranted.\nIn additional emails from Youth A’s worker, on 08/27/21, it was reported that Youth A\nhad an appointment outside of the facility and that he was brought to the\nappointment in a stained orange jumpsuit and shackled around his waist and feet,\nand in handcuffs. The worker said that she requested that he be brought in his court\nclothes and didn’t understand why he had to be shackled as he is able to go off\ncampus with his workers without being shackled. Per the doctor’s request, the\nshackles and handcuffs were removed. The security staff reportedly told the doctor\nthat if Youth A runs, then the doctor and his staff can chase him, because they were\nnot going to. Youth A’s worker said that Youth A, “did great during the entire day.”\nThe worker added that during the assessment he disclosed that he has had suicidal\nideation and that, although she had some difficulty getting in touch with the facility to\nfollow up, the Director told her they would put him on suicide prevention and bring in\nthe psychiatrist for evaluation. The worker further said that the Director told her that\ntheir policy is if the youth leaves the facility with their staff that they are shackled at\nthe waist and feet and handcuffed, but if they are with a worker or attorney they don’t\nhave to be because he is in other’s care. The Director also told the worker that a\nplan needed to be worked out for the court clothes and she advised him that we\nhave discussed this several times and that he needs to be in court clothes for his\nappointments. Reportedly, the Director said the “clinical staff” didn’t tell them or else\nhe could have worn them.\nI met with Director 1 onsite on 08/26/21, to discuss the incident and review the\nvideo. Upon initial review of this incident, I noted the concern over physical\nmanagement being used due to the youth throwing mayonnaise at FM1 and\nconcerns related to the manner in which Youth A was transported. Director 1 said\nthat he agreed and would have to address that with the staff.\nVideo review of this incident:\nThe video began with Youth A, peers, and staff, including FM1, on the pod. Youth A\nwas observed in an escalated and agitated state. Youth A was seen throwing\nvarious items, including books, dumping garbage out, and slamming and kicking\ndoors. The staff and FM1 appeared to be giving Youth A space to vent his anger and\ndidn’t respond to his outburst. At about 12:31:17, Youth A tossed mayonnaise at\nFM1, getting it on FM1’s face. FM1 walked toward Youth A who walked away from\nFM1. FM1 put hands on Youth A by grabbing Youth A’s arms from behind him, in an\napparent attempt to put the youth in a restraint hold. At about 12:31:24 the two\nmoved under a camera and out of view. They return to view at about 12:31:37 and\nwere seen walking along the wall with FM1 holding Youth A from behind by the back\nof his jumper. FM1 was also seen grabbing Youth A over Youth A’s shoulder near\nhis neck from behind. Youth A continued to avoid the restraint hold by pressing his\n6",
    "right side and shoulder into the wall. Staffs 2 and 3 approached and Staff 3 assisted\nFM1 by grabbing Youth A’s left arm and holding Youth A by the back of his jumper.\nFM1 and Staff 3 then push Youth A forward and into his bedroom while Youth A\nstruggled with them. They entered the room about 12:31:52. The video skipped from\nabout 12:31:56 until 12:32:09 and the two staff exited the room at 12:32:11.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 08/26/21. Youth A reported the following\nrelated to the allegations and the additional information provided by his worker.\nYouth A said that in regard to the iPad incident, it was the new school program’s\niPad, and they have since locked the websites he accessed. He said that he\nreceived 5 days of loss of his “greens” (privileges). After that incident, Youth A said\nhe got into the fight with the peer. Youth A described the incident very similar to how\nhe reported it to his worker (noted above). Youth A said that the peer scared him\nfrom behind which caused Youth A to jump and spill water on himself. Youth A said\nhe then threw the rest of the water on the peer and then hit the peer in the head with\na notebook and walked to his bedroom. The peer then hit him in the head when he\nwas walking away, which led to both youth throwing books/chairs at one another.\nYouth A said, “I accept that he hit me. I went too far.” Youth A said that his\nconsequence for this was that he lost his library privileges. Youth A said that this\nconsequence was added to his loss of greens so that he didn’t permanently lose his\nlevel and have to go up for it again and said that the staff kind of helped him out by\ndoing this. He said that he did not lose gym privileges, he just doesn’t choose to go\nbecause he doesn’t like it. The other peer lost gym because he likes gym. Youth A\nsaid that he only had one book for one day but got another 10 or more books the\nnext day. Youth A said that a peer brought from the library for him. He said there are\nother books on the pod that he had access to, but only one that he had not read yet.\nYouth A also confirmed that there are also books in the treatment room that he could\nhave accessed.\nYouth A said that on the day of the restraint, which was 08/23/21, he was still upset\nabout the library restriction consequences and was acting out, slamming doors, and\nthrowing things on the pod. Youth A said that he also grabbed a mayonnaise packet\nand squirted/threw it on FM1 and was then restrained and pushed against the wall.\nYouth A said he was then dragged to his room. Youth A said that he did not recall\nwhat staff it was, but someone helped FM1 get him into his room. Youth A reported\nno injury during this process. He said that he did see the nurse later on.\nYouth A reported that in regard to his treatment, Youth A does get anger\nmanagement and sexual reactivity therapy, but more of the anger management\ntreatment topics. He reported individual therapy occurs once weekly and they always\ndo their sessions. Youth A recalled one time that the individual session was missed,\nbut he said it was made up with two sessions the next week. Youth A did note that\nthey are not doing group therapy regularly.\nYouth A said that if residents are restrained, they are not allowed to talk to workers\nbecause “kids say things they don’t mean.” Youth A said that time is so the youth\n7",
    "can calm down. Youth A also stated, “My worker doesn’t agree, but I understand it.”\nYouth A said that for some calls with workers, there is a therapist there to monitor it.\nYouth A was able to identify that if he had a problem or concern with a restraint or if\nhe was hurt, that he would tell someone. When asked who he would tell, he said he\nwould probably tell the nurse.\nI interviewed the Facility Manger (FM1) at the facility on 08/31/21. The manager was\nasked about this restraint. We reviewed the video and FM1 said that he initiated the\nphysical management because Youth A kept escalating and was throwing garbage.\nFM1 said that they moved other kids to the treatment room so staff could focus on\nYouth A. FM1 said that he continued to talk to Youth A to verbally deescalate him,\nbut he kept banging on doors and threw books toward FM1. FM1 said that they\ncontinued to give Youth A space to vent and time to calm down and they started\ngetting ready for lunch. FM1 said that when Youth A squirted mayonnaise on FM1’s\nface and in his eye, FM1 initiated the restraint because Youth A was then being\nphysically aggressive and “lashing out at actual people.” FM1 said that he did not\nknow what Youth A was going to do next.\nI asked FM1 about the other concerns reported by Youth A’s worker. FM1 said that\nhe did not know anything about phone calls being prohibited for 48 hours after a\nrestraint. In regard to the iPad, FM1 said that he heard about it but was not there\nduring that incident and was not involved in the consequences. FM1 said that a loss\nof “greens” or level privileges would be warranted in a case like that as the youth\nwas not meeting level expectations. Behaviors like this would also be processed via\nindividual therapy, group sessions, thinking work/assignments as part of how the\nyouth earn their level back. In regard to the altercation with the peer, FM1 said that\nhe was there and saw that. FM1 reported that removal of library privileges is a\ntypical type of consequence as is loss of merit points. The consequence was added\non, but they “cut him a break so he didn’t lose his level totally.” FM1 said that youth\nhave group sessions daily.\nI interviewed the Therapist on 09/09/21 at the facility. The Therapist reported being\nassigned to work with Youth A since July 2021. The Therapist reported that the\nschool discovered Youth A had accessed pornography on one of the iPads. Due to\nthis, Youth A received a five-day level drop. The incident was processed in therapy\nthe following week when the Therapist saw Youth A again. Youth A was also\nprovided a rational thinking assignment. The Therapist said that she is not facilitating\ngroup sessions at this time, because she is only covering for another therapist who\nis on maternity leave. This group of youth is being split between three therapists to\ncover for the maternity leave. The Therapist said that she does group with her\nregularly assigned youth, but only individual sessions with the youth she is covering.\nIn regard to the incident with a peer, the Therapist said that she was not clear on the\ndetails of the full incident. She said that therapists get consequence forms when\nthere is an incident, but not the incident reports. The Therapist said that additional\nconsequences such as, removal of library privileges, is typical. When Youth A was\nrestrained, the Therapist said she was notified by FM1. The Therapist said that FM1\n8",
    "told her that Youth A’s behaviors escalated because he couldn’t go to the library,\nand he began throwing books and garbage. Then Youth A picked up food and\nsquirted mayonnaise in FM1’s eyes. Additionally, the Therapist confirmed that there\nare books available on the pods for the youth. In regard to the phone calls, the\nTherapist said that she was not aware of any 48-hour restriction on phone calls after\nan incident. The Therapist said that youth would be able to have a call as long as\nthey were not in seclusion for something. The Therapist said that workers can speak\nwith kids, but they cannot simply call up to the pod and talk to them; callers have to\nbe verified and scheduled. Supervisors and Managers have to coordinate calls as\nyouth have to be brought up to the visitation rooms where there are phones for them\nto use.\nI conducted an unannounced visit on 10/13/21 and walked onto Youth A’s pod (Pod\nA) to find Youth A and his peers in group therapy with the Therapist.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility on 10/25/21. Staff 2 appeared displeased with\nhaving to meet about this incident. Staff 2 recalled this incident and said that the\nwhole issue was on Youth A and that Youth A was acting like “a real ass.” Staff 2\nsaid they tried to give Youth A space and deescalate him, but he wasn’t responding.\nStaff 2 said that the staff didn’t do anything wrong. Staff 2 said that he did not recall\nif he participated in any part of the escort of Youth A and stated that he did not know\nStaff 3.\nAn attempt was made to contact Staff 3 via phone, as he is a contingent staff and\nnot scheduled regularly, but his phone was not in service.\nI met with Director 2 on 10/25/21 at the facility. Director 2 reported that the facility\ndoes not have a policy related to youth’s use of electronics.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Incident Report for the 08/20/21 incident with Youth A and his peer. It was\nnoted that Youth A and a peer engaged in a verbal dispute and were directed\nto cease the conversation. The two ignored the staff direction and threw water\non each other. The peer assaulted Youth A by striking him in the face and\nboth youths picked up their chairs and tossed them at one another. The\nSecurity officer stepped between them, and their actions stopped. Both youth\nutilized time outs until they were able to regain self-control.\n Incident Report for the 08/23/21 restraint of Youth A. Authored by FM1 and\nsubmitted to MiSACWIS by FM2. The report was consistent with the interview\nof FM1.\n Unusual Incident Report Witness Statement, dated 08/23/21, authored by\nStaff 2. Marked for Resident Assault on Staff. The report reads, “Resident\nwas off focus and was throwing around objects. He was physically managed\nescorted to room.”\n Unusual Incident Report Summary, dated 08/23/21, authored by FM1 and\napproved by Director 1.\n9",
    " Medical Progress Note, 08/23/21, by the Nurse. No injuries or concerns.\n Youth Discipline Policy\no Continued Negative Behaviors (includes)\n Possession of contraband: possession of any unauthorized\narticles or materials including possession of pornography or\nattempting to obtain pornography.\n Threatening the safety of others/Intimidating or Bullying\no Consequences for Continued Negative Behaviors\n Staff will also select one or two of the following consequences:\n 1. A loss of free time recreation privileges for 3 days.\n 6. Temporary return to Level One Merit System\nPrivileges for 5 days.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.159 Resident restraint.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies\nand procedures regarding restraint. These policies and\nprocedures shall be available to all residents, their\nfamilies, and referring agencies.\n(3) The written policy shall include all of the following:\n(a) Procedures for the review of an incident of restraint\nwithin 48 hours by a level of supervision above the\nstaff ordering or conducting the restraint to\ndetermine if the requirements of the institution’s\nprocedures were adhered to in directing and\nconducting the restraint.\n(4) The written policy shall only permit the licensee to\nrestrain a child for the following circumstances:\n(a) To prevent injury to the child, self-injury, or injury to\nothers.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as Youth A’s behaviors,\nalthough escalated, did not present an immediate risk of injury\nto anyone. The staff were observed providing space for Youth A\nuntil Youth A squirted the mayonnaise on FM1. This does not\nqualify as justification for physical restraint. Additionally, FM1\nwas observed on the video review to not use proper Handle with\nCare technique during the escort to Youth A’s room. FM1 was\nobserved with his arm over Youth A’s shoulder at one point and\ngrabbing the back of Youth A’s jumper as well. Staff 3 was also\nobserved grabbing Youth A by the back of his jumper. The two\nstaff pushed Youth A into his bedroom. An escort is permitted\nbut the youth must be walking on their own and not being forced\nto move while resisting, as occurred in this instance. The staff\nshould have put Youth A in a proper two person standing\n10",
    "restraint until he was cooperative to walk. Additionally, this\nrestraint incident report was completed by FM2 and should have\nbeen reviewed prior to submission. If proper review had\noccurred, the non-compliances could have been addressed by\nthe facility.\nThere is no finding that the facility did not upload a restraint, as\nYouth A was not restrained in the 08/20/21 incident.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nPreviously cited under Emergency Rule 1 while in effect:\nSIR2020C0201018 initiated 5/13/20; CAP approved 9/24/20\nSIR2021C0108004 initiated 10/13/20; CAP approved 12/23/20\nSIR2021C0108005 initiated 10/22/20; CAP approved 12/23/20\nSIR2021C0212023 initiated 06/08/21; CAP approved 10/21/21\nSIR2021C0212025 initiated 06/28/21; CAP approved 10/21/21\nSIR2021C0207022 initiated 07/19/21; CAP approved 10/21/21\nAPPLICABLE Contract\nRFCJJ 2.10 Services to be Provided\na. Trauma Informed Practice Model\n1) Services provided under this Contract must be trauma\ninformed and be evidence-based, evidence-informed or\nidentified as a promising practice to effect optimal\noutcomes.\nANALYSIS: It was alleged and confirmed the facility brought Youth A to\ncourt in a jumpsuit. While this did occur, there is no explicit\nrequirement to not do so.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe facility was provided Technical Assistance verbally and via\nemail related to not sending youth into the community in their\nfacility jumpsuits as this is not an example of a therapeutic\naction on the part of the facility. The facility can provide court\nclothes for the youth for outside appointments or other suitable\nattire, in an effort to provide a more therapeutic and caring\nenvironment, given these are children in a treatment facility and\nnot a correctional institution.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\n11",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of\nthe following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for\naddressing residents’ needs, implementation of\ntreatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nANALYSIS: The facility does not have a policy pertaining to the use of\nelectronics by youth.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThe facility is advised to ensure they develop a policy or\nprocedure for monitoring the youth’s use of electronics. This\nshould apply to use of school equipment and recreational\ndevices, such as video games.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nThe youth is not receiving required therapy services.\nINVESTIGATION:\nSee interview content above.\nDocumentation reviewed:\nSample of therapy notes for Youth A from a 10-week period of July through mid-\nSeptember. The Therapist’s note for 07/23/21 was copied and pasted from the\n07/14/21 note, including the date of service as 07/14/21. The Therapist’s note from\n09/03/21 indicated the therapist would be out of the office for the week. Group\nsessions are summarized each weekly entries and they note that the youth is\nexpected to attend group sessions five times a week, Monday through Friday. Seven\nof the ten weeks only had this statement and no documentation of group topics,\nwhether the sessions were done, and/or whether the youth participated.\n12",
    "APPLICABLE Contract\nRFCJJ Attachment A: Residential Foster Care Juvenile Justice\nProgram Types\n1. Mental Health and Behavior Stabilization\nServices\nf. Individual, Group and Family Therapy\ni. Both individual and group therapy are requirements\nof this Contract. At least two times per week, the\nContractor must provide direct therapeutic\ninterventions for each youth individually and/or in\ngroup sessions. At least one session per week must\nbe an individual therapy session. Individual and/or\ngroup therapy must be provided in accordance with\nthe youth’s treatment needs as identified in the\nyouth’s service plan.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the contract as the Therapist\nacknowledged that this group was not getting group therapy.\nAdditionally, there is not sufficient documentation of provision of\nrequired therapy sessions. In a review of a sample of individual\ntherapy notes, it was found that no individual therapy was\ndocumented for two of the ten weeks. Also, the notes for group\nsessions are vague and do not provide sufficient detail to verify\nthat group sessions occurred daily (per the facility’s protocol)\nand whether the specified youth participated. This\ndocumentation supports the Therapist’s and Youth A’s reports of\ngroup sessions not always occurring.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nMissing therapy sessions was cited as part of reason for the\nviolation for R 158 Discipline, in SIR 2021C0103027 and a\ncorrective action plan was approved on 10/21/21.\nMissing therapy sessions was cited as a finding in the last\nRenewal Report, 07/21/21, under RFCJJ Contract Oct 17:\nAttachment A.2 Weekly Individual Therapy. The facility was\nrequired under that old contract to provide twice weekly\nindividual therapy but was only providing weekly therapy. The\nCAP was approved 08/11/21.\n13",

Phone calls are scheduled\nby pod and will be monitored by staff. Calls to CPS, attorneys,\nand agency case works are not monitored. There are no\nincoming calls for youth.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram statement which specifically addresses all of\nthe following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for\naddressing residents’ needs, implementation of\ntreatment plans, and discharge of residents.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as they are not following\ntheir own policy on phone calls by monitoring youth calls with\nworkers. The facility does not allow for incoming phone calls.\nPer the Therapist, workers, or others, incoming calls must be\nverified and coordinated through a supervisor or manager to\nbring the youth up to a visitation room where there are phones.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nSIR 2021C0103018, CAP approved 7/1/21\nSIR 2021C0103016, CAP approved 6/24/21\nSIR 2021C0108025, CAP approved 4/22/21\nSIR 2020C0219029, CAP approved 5/18/20\nSIR 2021C0103027, CAP approved 10/21/21\n14",
    "ALLEGATION:\nYouth A reported that he is not allowed to, nor has a way to file a grievance.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A’s worker reported that Youth A told her he was not allowed to file a\ngrievance and that the grievance box on the pod was down.\nI interviewed Youth A at the facility on 08/26/21. Youth A reported that a former\nresident ripped the grievance box off of the wall on their pod and it was never put\nback up. Youth A stated that the residents now tell a manager if they have a concern\nand named three Facility Managers, including FM1, whom they can tell. Youth A\nsaid that FM1 and another manager listen and are good about responding, but he\nfelt the third manager forgets things a lot. Youth A stated that if he had a “major”\nconcern, that he would also report it to his worker, but would go to the managers\nfirst.\nOn 08/31/21, I walked through Youth A’s pod and other pods at the facility with FM1.\nThe grievance box on Youth A’s pod was observed to be missing. The grievance\nbox on another pod was smashed to the degree that it appeared inoperable.\nI interviewed FM1 on 08/31/21 at the facility. FM1 said that the grievance boxes do\nget knocked down by the youth but should be put back up. He noted that he would\nfollow up to see that it was reinstalled.\nIn subsequent meetings with the Chief Administrator, it was reported that they\ninstalled folders on those pods with missing and/or damaged grievance box for youth\nto use for grievance forms. I observed this to be completed during a weekly\nunannounced visit to the facility as well.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Youth Grievance Policy\nA. Step 1: Youth may request to speak with a Shift Supervisor regarding a\ngrievance or ask for a grievance form and write the complaint down. After\ncompleting the grievance form, youth will place it in one of the\n“confidential” locked boxes provided on each pod.\n15",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4132 Grievance procedures.\n(1) An agency shall have and follow a written grievance handling\nprocedure for residents and their families. All of the following\napply:\n(a) The policy shall be provided to residents, their families,\nand referring sources prior to or at admission.\n(b) The policy shall be explained in a language the resident\nand his or her family can understand.\n(c) There shall be written acknowledgement the policy was\nprovided as required in subdivision (a) of this subrule.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation as they are not following their policy for\nwritten grievances. The grievance box on Youth A’s pod was\nobserved to be missing, leaving the youth with no confidential\nplace to submit grievance forms. On another pod, the grievance\nbox was observed to be smashed in so much that it appeared\nthat a grievance form would not be able to be put in the box. I\nalso recommended to the Chief Administrator that, although the\nfolders are a good temporary solution, the facility must return to\nthe use of the secure metal boxes to comply with their policy\nand ensure resident confidentiality.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current 3rd\nprovisional license status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility\nsubmitting an acceptable CAP for the noted violations.\nOctober 29, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\n16",
