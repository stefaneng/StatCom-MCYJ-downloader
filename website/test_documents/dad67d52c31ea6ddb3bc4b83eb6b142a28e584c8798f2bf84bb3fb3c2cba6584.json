INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Staff qualifications; volunteer, contractors on central registry.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206\nSection (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nDescription and able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1:\nThe Foster Care Worker communicates disrespectfully with the birth\nparents, using derogatory language.\nAllegation 2:\nThe foster worker is writing documents which are not on agency\nletterhead or are not official and having the birth parent to signs the\ndocument(s).\nInvestigation I had email contact with the Chief Administrator (CA) on\n5/30/2024. I spoke with her directly about the complaint allegations\non 6/4/2024. CA did not have direct information about the\nallegations. She reported being aware that the birth parents are\nones who always seem to have concerns, and who have tried to\nrecord staff’s phone conversation with them or to document things\nin an attempt to show a concern. She reported neither birth parent\nhas contacted her about these concerns, but the agency’s\nAdministrative Director had contact with the parents on 6/2/2024.\nShe reported the agency’s team members are communicating daily\nto create a plan on how to move forward collaboratively with\naddressing each concern from the birth parents. The staff on the\ncase would be better able to address each allegation.\nInterviews:\nAllegation 1:\nI interviewed Birth Parent 1 by telephone on 5/29/2024 and Birth\nParent 2 by telephone on 6/6/2024.\nBirth Parent 1 reported usually at every visit Foster Care Worker\n2",
    "(FCW) makes to their home, FCW is disrespectful to them and\ncurses them. Birth Parent 1 reported FCW tells them to shut up and\nhas made smart or inappropriate comments to them. Such as when\nBirth Parent 2 asked FCW about receipt of their drug screens, FCW\nresponded “how do you know we don’t have it and we are just not\ntelling you we have received it.” Birth Parent 1 did not clarify what\nthat meant or how that statement was disrespectful.\nBirth Parent 1 reported informing Foster Care Supervisor (FCS)\nabout their concerns with FCW via text on or about 5/22/2024. He\ntold Foster Care Supervisor he and Birth Parent 2 no longer wanted\nFCW in their home because today was not the day for FCW to be\ndisrespectful, that they were tired of it, and were filing a complaint.\nHe also told FCS this concern by telephone two weeks ago. He\nreported telling the agency’s Program Manager about the concern\nas well. He said the Program Manager was at their home visit on\n5/28/2024 and did not address the matter. Birth Parent 1 admitted\nthat a Zoom meeting was scheduled for them today with Program\nManager, Foster Care Supervisor and FCW to discuss his and Birth\nParent 2’s concerns.\nBirth Parent 2 neither reported, nor confirmed the allegation that\nFCW cursed her and Birth Parent 1. She confirmed Birth Parent 1’s\nreporting about FCW’s rudeness/statement to her when she asked\nhim about one of her drug screen results. She reported FCW told\nher he was not giving them the information.\nBirth Parent 2 reported the agency and FCW has no regard for them\nand continues to inflict harm on her and her family by their actions.\nBirth Parent 2 made that statement after referencing a number of\nthings she stated had taken place on the case that did not relate to\nthis specific allegation. Such as why/how the children came into\ncare, the agency changing their parenting time visitation from\nunsupervised visits to supervised, and the worker reporting a\nconcern with her housing/lease.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about this allegation\nby telephone on 5/31/2024. He reported prior to 5/24/2024 he had\nnever heard the birth parents report that FCW was disrespectful or\nthat he cursed them. He stated the birth parents sent him a text\nmessage on 5/24/2024 saying they were tired of the disrespect and\nthat FCW is no longer welcome in their home. At that time, the birth\nparent did not elaborate on how FCW was disrespectful, or what\nFCW had done or said. FCS reported, during a telephone call with\nthe birth parents by the agency’s Program Manager on 5/29/2024,\nthe birth parents mentioned something about FCW disrespecting\n3",
    "them. They indicated FCW told them to “shut your mouths and\nlisten to me”.\nFCS reported he spoke with FCW about the allegations indicated by\nthe birth parents. FCW denied them. FCW reported the birth parents\nwere unhappy with him following a home visit on 5/22/2024\nwhereby he had to let the birth parents know that due to a DHHS\ncomplaint alleging Birth Parent 1 left one of children in a car\nunattended, the agency had to initiate a safety plan with them and\nthat their unsupervised visits were reversed to supervised visits.\nFCS reported regarding drug screens, the agency generally sends\nthis information to court with the court report. The workers check\nthe birth parents drug tests weekly to discern for any positive drug\nscreens. Thereon, the worker lets the birth parent know as soon as\npossible about those results. He reported that would have been the\nsame case scenario with Birth Parent 1 and Birth Parent 2’s results\nunless they were not received timely. He reported the birth parents\nmay be upset about those results. He reported the birth parents\nalleged Birth Parent 2’s positive drug screen result for\nmethamphetamine was false. He reported the birth parent was\nupset, insisted the test result was some type of false positive but\nFluorine Fluids reported the drug screen results as accurate. He\nreported a social work contact on or about 4/19/2024 would indicate\ninformation about that.\nAdditionally, FCS reported being unable to visualize FCW saying to\na client what is alleged related to this complaint. He reported FCW\nhas not had disciplinary actions, and no concerns have been\nreported about his interaction/engagement with others.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. He reported being the case manager on the\ncase for Child A, Child B and Child C since April 2024. He admitted\nhe may have used a curse word indirectly when speaking with the\nbirth parents, like this “shit is crazy, but he denied ever cursing them\nor telling them to shut up. Nor did he tell them anything like “how do\nyou know I don’t have it and I’m just not giving it to you”, in\nreference to drug screen results. He reported the birth parents may\nbe upset with him over the fact that he has been the bearer of bad\nnews. Such as, he had to tell them the agency had to end their\nunsupervised parenting time and the birth parents did not like that.\nHe denied that he has been disrespectful to them. He reported he\nhas told them he knows some things, but not all things. He has told\nthem he will have to get back to them to provide the information\nthey requested because he may not have it or did not know it at the\n4",
    "time. He reported giving them drug screen results that he has\naccess to. He reported many times Birth Parent 2 talks really fast,\nask for one thing, then when FCW provides the information, she\nreports she/they asked for something else. He said he tries to write\nthe things down that he may need to follow up on. He said, Birth\nParent 2 records conversations she has with him and others and\nhas reported she does that so she can remember what she said. He\nreported that in that same regards he shared with Birth Parent 2 if\nshe can’t remember what she said, then why would she expect he\nwould, unless he wrote it down.\nI interviewed Program Manager (PM) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. PM reported she has no reason to believe\nthis allegation. She reported FCS addressed the allegation with\nFCW. FCW denied the allegation. PM reported Birth Parent 1 and\nBirth Parent 2 have presented as very difficult to communicate with,\nespecially Birth Parent 2. PM said the agency is working on how to\nbetter address and respond to the birth parents, especially Birth\nParent 2, given Birth Parent 2’s tendency to interrupt and cut the\nstaff persons off in conversations. She confirmed CA’s reporting\nrelated to the agency’s continued plan to work with the birth parents\nrelated to concerns the birth parents may bring forth.\nAllegation 2:\nI interviewed Birth Parent 1 by telephone on 5/29/2024 and Birth\nParent 2 by telephone on 6/6/2024.\nBirth Parent 1 reported following a complaint lodged against him\nand Birth Parent 2, the FCW wrote out a safety plan on paper right\nin front of him and had him to sign it. He said the document was not\non letterhead. He questioned that document being real or\nprofessional. Two weeks ago, he asked where the real safety plan\nwas and learned that was it. He reported that he did not get a copy\nof the safety plan and believes it was something done just to save\nthe agency’s “butt.” He did not explain the meaning of that or how\nthe safety plan would have saved the agency. He denied there\nbeing another document that was unofficial or written up by FCW\nthat was of concern.\nBirth Parent 2 reported lots of information about her case which did\nnot relate to this allegation. She did not disclose information about\nthis allegation or her signature on the document Birth Parent 1\nreported on. The only document she referenced signing or\nreportedly being forced to sign was one related to placement of her\nchildren with her father that did not relate to this agency.\n5",
    "I interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about this allegation\nby telephone on 5/31/2024. He reported the only document FCW\nhad the birth parent(s) sign was a safety plan. He reported that\nsafety plan was handwritten and hand written safety plans are\nallowed by the agency.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. He reported after he was notified of a DHHS\nallegation against the birth parents related to one of the children\nbeing left unattended for a time in the birth parents’ car, he had to\nmake a home visit with the birth parents within 24-hours. He took\npaper with him and wrote up a safety plan. He denied being told or\nadvised a safety plan must be typed or be on agency letterhead. He\nwas told the document can just be scanned and upload into\nMISACWIS.\nHe reported during the home visit with the birth parents he\ndiscussed the complaint allegations, attempted to safety plan with\nthe birth parents around not leaving the children unattended, and to\nconducted drug testing on them. He reported the bulk of the\ndiscussion was with Birth Parent 1. Birth Parent 2 stayed in her\nroom and refused to come out or to come sign the document. Birth\nParent 1 signed the document and FCW asked him if Birth Parent 2\nwould sign it the next day. The next day Birth Parent 2 texted FCW\nand asked him why she would “sign something under duress”.\nFCW reported not knowing what Birth Parent 2 was referencing with\nher duress statement. He said he turned the safety plan over to his\nsupervisor for her to try to get Birth Parent 2’s signature. He said,\nas recent as 5/28/2024 FCS attempted to get Birth Parent 2’s\nsignature and Birth Parent 2 refused to sign the document.\nI interviewed Program Manager (PM) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. PM reported information similarly to FCS\nrelated to a safety plan being attempted with the birth parents. She\nconfirmed FCW’s reporting that the handwritten safety plan was\naround supervision of the children following a DHHS complaint\nrelated to the birth parents. She further confirmed FCS’s and FCW’s\nindications that the agency does not always type up these\ndocuments or have a requirement that they be typed. She advised\nthe agency can do a better job with the content on the plans and\nlabeling them. She said another document was typed up for this\nplan and both birth parents refused to sign it.\nDocument Review\nA handwritten safety plan received from FCS that indicated:\n• Don’t leave the car with children inside. Don’t leave children\n6",
    "unattended. If you have to run an errand have another\napproved adult supervise the children. Children may only be\nsupervised by an approved adult.\n• This document was signed by FCW and Birth Parent 1 on\n5/22/2024.\n• A written notation dated 5/22/2024 stated Birth Parent 2\nrefused to sign.\nChild A’s, Child B’s, and Child C’s MISACWIS case record showed:\n• A 5/22/2024 social work case narrative showing FCW’s home\nvisits with Birth Parent 1 and Birth Parent 2, and FCW’s\nattempt to go over the safety plan with both parents. The\nnarrative also showed information as described by FCW\nrelated to Birth Parent 2 refusing to leave her room, talk, or\nengage with him and refusing to sign the safety plan.\n• Another handwritten safety plan with information similar to\nthe one listed above showed FCW and another person\nsigned it on 5/22/2024. The plan had a handwritten notation\non it stating that another person (no name) gave verbal\napproval on 5/23/2024. A 5/22/2024 social work narrative\nshowed an exchange with the Caregiver Spouse in person,\nand the Caregiver by telephone at that time about this safety\nplan.\n• Another safety plan typed on agency letterhead which had\nhandwritten corrections, and indicated the information\nreported in the first safety plan for Birth Parent 1 and Birth\nParent 2 around not leaving their minor children in a car\nunattended. This safety plan was signed by both Birth\nParent 1, Birth Parent 2 and FCW on 6/6/6024.\n• A 4/19/2024 social work contact as referenced by FCS which\nshowed what FCS indicated when he was interviewed.\nAnalysis Based on information from interviews and documentation reviewed,\nthe evidence does not substantiate the allegations or a lack of\nworker character or suitability to meet the needs of children and\nfamilies served by the agency.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABILISHED.\nRule Code Staff responsibilities.\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12207\nSection (3) An agency shall require that social service workers be directly\nDescription responsible for all the following activities:\n(a) Placing and supervising children in out-of-home care.

    "development, implementation, and review of service plans for the\nchildren and their families.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1\nThe agency is allowing the Caregiver’s spouse to smoke drugs in\nfront of the children.\nAllegation 2\nThe agency is not keeping the birth parents aware of their children’s\nmedical, dental and educational events. Nor is the agency doing\nwhat is required to aid the birth parents in the children’s return\nhome.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nAllegation 1:\nI interviewed Birth Parent 1 by telephone on 5/29/2024 and Birth\nParent 2 by telephone on 6/6/2024:\nBirth Parent 1 and Birth Parent 2 both reported Caregiver’s\nSpouse smoked in front of the children. Birth Parent 1 reported\nCaregiver allows Caregiver’s Spouse to keep the children and this\nperson smokes drugs in front of them. Birth Parent 1 reported he\nhas proof in the form of a text and a picture showing the person\n“smoking her drugs” after she lays one of the children down for a\nnap. He believes Caregiver’s Spouse was teasing him about her\nbeing able to be with the children, while he and Birth Parent 2 are\nnot. He reported what Caregiver’s Spouse is smoking is either a\nmarijuana joint or some other drug. He reported disclosing this\ninformation to the agency and providing them the aforementioned\nproof. He said the event occurred in May 2024. He reported the\nagency said they investigated and addressed the matter with\nCaregiver and Caregiver’s Spouse, and they reported there was\nnothing of concern.\nBirth Parent 1 provided me a copy of the texts and picture he\nreferenced. A review of the documents showed:\n• A text message with a female’s first name at the top of it\nand wording in the message that read “Nap time lol. Don’t\nyou wish you were here. Lol ewww gross”.\n• A picture of a women with sunglasses on sitting in a lawn\nchair with what appears to be some type of cigarette in her\nmouth. Under this picture, in the same screen, is a part of\nthe text message mentioned above “Nap time lol. Don’t you\nwish you were here”. It is not clear from this picture\n8",
    "whether the object in her mouth is a cigarette or some other\nsubstance. There are no children in the picture.\nI interviewed Foster care Supervisor (FCS) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 5/31/2024, Foster Care Worker (FCW) by telephone\non 6/5/2024, and Program Manager (PM) by telephone on\n6/11/2024.\nFCS reported he received a text message about this allegation on\nor about 5/28/2024. He reported the birth parent may have\nmentioned Caregiver’s Spouse smoking marijuana in the past, not\nthat Caregiver’s Spouse smokes around the children. He said the\nbirth parents inquired of him why was he not drug testing the\nCaregivers and he explained. FCS said he addressed the matter\nwith Caregiver’s Spouse during a home visit on 5/14/2024, and the\nCaregiver’s Spouse denied smoking Marijuana. FCS reported after\nreceiving the text picture from the birth parent on 5/28/2024 FCW\nfollowed up on this matter on 5/29/2024. A discussion and safety\nplan was conducted with the caregivers.\nFCW did not report any specific information outside of what was\nreported by the FCS.\nPM did not report information related to this allegation.\nAllegation 2\nI interviewed Birth Parent 1 by telephone on 5/29/2024 and Birth\nParent 2 by telephone on 6/6/2024.\nBirth Parent 1 reported the agency is shutting them out of their\nchildren lives. That they do not get information on the children’s\ndoctor appointments and their daughter, Child A, had dental surgery\nwithout their consent.\nHe further reported the agency has not provided them with any\nreport cards for the children or anything related to school. He\nadmitted the agency provided him some type of picture book related\nto his son, Child B, on 5/8/2024.\nBirth Parent 2 reported the agency is not doing all they can related\nto their visits or trying to reunify her with her children as ordered by\nthe court. They also do not keep her and Birth Parent 1 aware of\nwhat’s going on with the children. She said the agency allowed her\ndaughter, Child A, to have dental surgery without her consent. She\nreported that Child A grinds her teeth and had some plaque which\ncaused a problem with her back teeth. She said she had taken\n9",
    "Child A to the dentist six months ago, as well as had taken Child A\nto see a private dentist prior to the children entering care. She did\nnot believe the agency when they reported that the Caregiver did\nthe dental surgical procedure without the agency’s knowledge. She\nsaid the agency knew. The agency filled out paperwork for the\nsurgery, which was either on 9/18/2023 or 1/16/2024. She said the\ndates on the document is confusing and suspicious because the\nagency is putting whatever dates they want on forms. She provided\na copy of the document she referenced.\nBirth Parent 2 reported the agency has not provided her medical\nappointments for the children, that she has only received medical\npassports. Conversely, Birth Parent 2 admitted she has scheduled\nmedical appointments for the children. She reported in March 2024,\nthe agency told her the birth parents were responsible, so she had\nscheduled and taken the children for appointments. She stated the\nagency has also scheduled some appointments without her\nknowledge, and DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services)\nhad gotten some immunizations for the children, because the\nCaregiver wanted them.\nBirth Parent 2 further reported the agency has not allowed her\ninvolvement in Child A’s school events. She reported the prior FCW\nadvised her that if she wanted to participate in Child A’s events\nsomeone from the agency had to be there. She said there was an\nevent, a graduation today and she attended, but the worker did not\nwant her there. She said the school has blocked her from attending\nparent/teacher conferences until Caregiver could be present.\nCaregiver would give her incorrect information about the\nparent/teacher conference.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about this allegation\nby telephone on 5/31/2024, he reported the case plan is\nreunification and efforts continue related to that plan. He reported\nChild A (age 5), Child B (age 2) and Child C (age 10 months) which\nthis complaint relates are placed with an unlicensed relative. He\ndenied the allegation of the agency not sharing information with the\nbirth parents. He reported Child A is the only child of the three\nchildren that is attending an educational program. Child A is also\nthe child who had dental care issues. During Child A’s treatment for\ncavities on or about 1/18/2024, Child A was given a general\nanesthesia with the Caregiver’s consent, and without the agency’s\nknowledge. The agency learned of this treatment method after the\nfact and informed the birth parents of the matter soon after it\noccurred. FCS said the agency also followed up with the dental\noffice on or about 1/19/2024 and advised the dentist that the birth\n10",
    "parents still have rights and must consent to such treatment\nprocedures.\nFCS reported the birth parents are involved in the children’s health\ncare. He said the children have not had any new medical or dental\nappointments. He said the birth parents took Child C to a well child\nappointment on 3/27/2024 and took Child A and Child B to dental\nappointments on 3/27/2024 and 5/20/2024, during parenting time.\nHe advised there may have been one time or so that the children\nhad gone to the doctor for illnesses without Caregiver reporting that\nto them. He reported one of the birth parents asking him via text\nmessage in early May 2024, why the kids keep going to the doctor\nwithout their knowledge. FCS reported he made contact with\nCaregiver on this matter, during a subsequent office visit. Caregiver\nreported the doctor visit or visits were due to the child or children\nbeing sick. He advised Caregiver they must also report these visits\nto the agency, so that the agency can keep the birth parents\ninformed.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. He reported being the case manager on the\ncase for Child A, Child B, and Child C since April 2024. He reported\nthe case plan remains reunification, and notwithstanding the recent\nDHHS allegation for the birth parents or Birth Parent 2’s positive\ndrug screen, the agency’s plan is to work toward that goal. The\nagency is not seeking a permanent relative placement with\nCaregiver, reunification with the birth parents is still being worked\non. Additionally, the agency is not trying to keep medical\ninformation/appointments for the children from the birth parents. He\nreported Child A’s dental treatment with the anesthesia occurred\nprior to his assignment on the case, but he was told Caregiver gave\npermission without the agency’s knowledge or consent. He\nreported not being aware of a specific medical or dental\nappointment not being shared with the birth parent. He reported\nBirth Parent 2 had told him she set up appointments for the\nchildren. Caregiver had also mentioned scheduling dental\nappointments for Child B and Child C, but Caregiver could not recall\nthe date. FCW reported two different dates were given respectively\nby Caregiver and birth parent and only one was confirmed.\nHe reported so as to not have what occurred around Child A’s\ndental treatment reoccur, he completed a safety plan with Caregiver\nin May 2024. He advised Caregiver they cannot just sign for things\nrelated to the children’s care. He said, Caregiver signed a safety\nplan related to this. He provided me a copy of that safety plan on\n6/5/2024. It was signed by FCW on 5/30/2024, with a notation that\n11",
    "Caregiver, (as referred by his first name) agreed verbally on\n5/30/2024. This safety plan indicated Caregiver would/will:\n• Let FCW know of upcoming medicals and dentals.\n• Give FCW 24-hour notice of upcoming appointment.\n• Not consent to any major medical decisions without parental\nconsent (anything outside of routine care).\n• Only give routine medical care.\n• Allow the biological parents to attend medical, dental, etc.\nappointments.\n• Let FCW know about parenting times that the caregiver\nadministered.\nFCW confirmed FCS’s reporting about Child A being the only one of\nBirth Parent 1’s and Birth Parent 2’s three children in school. He\nreported Child A is in kindergarten and no information is being kept\nfrom the birth parent. He reported Birth Parent 1 and Birth Parent 2\nbeing upset with him about Child A’s kindergarten celebration. He\nreported only finding out about the event on 6/4/2024, and he told\nthe birth parents on 6/5/2025. He reported the day before he was\ntrying to work out parenting issues. The birth parents felt they\nshould have known sooner and were upset about not being able to\nattend, which they did anyway. He affirmed that Caregiver is Birth\nParent 2’s father and was not sure why Caregiver had not shared\nthe information with the birth parents.\nI interviewed Program Manager (PM) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. PM reported information similarly to what\nFCS reported related to Child A and the caregiver’s action around\nthe child’s dental treatment. She said the prior FCW addressed the\nissue with Caregiver and advised Caregiver of the agency’s need to\nbe advised in advance of the child’s need for any treatment so that\nproper consent can be obtained from the parents. She reported\nhaving the discussion with that FCW. She reported most recently\nthe current FCW also addressed this matter with Caregiver.\nShe reported there may have been an appointment whereby\nCaregiver took Child B and or Child C for a doctor’s visit when the\nchild was sick and did not share that information with the agency.\nThe latter is also why the current FCW safety planned with\nCaregiver on letting FCW/the agency know about medical and\ndental appointments they schedule for the children, as well as when\nthey take the children to the doctor due to being sick.\nPM also reported the birth parents were scheduling some of the\nchildren medical appointments during their unsupervised parenting\ntime. The birth parents also went to the school related to Child A’s\n12",
    "school functions.\nDocument Review:\n• Safety plan as described in the narrative section for this\nallegation.\n• The text message and photo provided by Birth Parent 1 as\ndescribed in the narrative section for this allegation.\n• Child A’s, Child B’s and Child C’s MISACWIS case record\nwhich showed:\n➢ The children entered care on 9/19/2023 and were\nplaced with the Caregiver on that date.\n➢ The children were placed under this agency’s\nsupervision on 9/22/2023.\n➢ The children were made temporary court wards on\n9/19/2023..\n➢ Initial placement medicals for each child on 9/18/2023;\nand subsequent medicals.

    "case plan.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nRule Code Visitation and family time; in person contact\nTitle\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12421\nSection (1) An agency shall develop a plan of visitation and family time for\nDescription each child in foster care consistent with the child’s service plans as\nrequired by R400.12419 and R400.12420 to ensure the safety and\nwellbeing of the child.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The foster care worker told the children’s caregiver not to bring the\nchildren to the Infant mental health visits.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nI interviewed Birth Parent 1 by telephone on 5/29/2024, and Birth\nParent 2 by telephone on 6/6/2024:\nBirth Parent 1 reported he and Birth Parent 2 have had parenting\ntime visits with their children since 9/1/2023. Additionally, they have\nhad Infant Mental Health (IMH) visits with the children, supervised\nwith a therapist twice weekly. He said the agency is now doing\neverything the agency can to ruin these visits for them. The agency\nallows the children’s Caregiver, to show up late. Birth Parent 1\nacknowledged that the agency allows their visit to go longer when\nthe caregiver shows up late. He reported when they complain to\nthe agency about Caregiver’s behavior the agency does nothing to\naddress Caregiver’s actions. He said the agency took their\novernight visits away, because the agency alleged Birth Parent 2\nhad tested positive for Methamphetamines, but they provided\ninformation from Birth Parent 2’s doctor that she may have a false\npositive. He denied missing a visit or therapist appointment and\nfeels the agency is not counting all of this.\nBirth Parent 2 confirmed statements made by Birth Parent 1. She\nreported the children’s caregiver is her estranged father. She said\nFCW told Caregiver on multiple occasions, and as recent as last\nweek (the week prior to this interview), that Caregiver did not have\nto come for the IMH visits. She said there have been three weeks\nin a row that Caregiver has missed the visit or has been late. She\nestimated the number of times missed or late to be three to five.\nShe reported according to the agency these visits are a burden on\nCaregiver. She said the agency has also changed her and Birth\n15",
    "Parent 1’s regular parenting visits from unsupervised visits to\nsupervised visits. She reported this change came about due to a\nmonth-old erroneous positive drug screen for her, which she\nreported was caused by her narcolepsy medication. Additionally,\ndue to a complaint against her and Birth Parent 1 for allegedly\nleaving the children in the car. She said their parenting time visits\nhave not been consistent and have gone from five times a week to\ntwo hours visits two times a week.\nI interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about this allegation\nby telephone on 5/31/2024. He denied this allegation. He reported\nthe birth parents have IMF therapy appointments with the children\nevery Friday from 5:30pm-6:30pm in the birth parents home. He\nsaid the birth parents’ regular scheduled parenting time is every\nTuesday from 5:00pm-700pm; supervised by the agency. He\nreported there has only been one situation, where Caregiver missed\na visit. That occurred in May 2024, where there was some confusion\nabout the IMH visit. Caregiver thought FCW told him the visit was a\nregular parenting time and Caregiver did not show up at the birth\nparents’ home for the IMH visit. Caregiver has not missed any other\nIMH or parenting time visits. If Caregiver shows up late for a\nparenting visit the agency makes up the time for the birth parents.\nI interviewed Foster Care Worker (FCW) about this allegation by\ntelephone on 6/5/2024. FCW confirmed the information as reported\nby FCS about both the IMH and parenting time visits. He added\nfurther that he addressed the missed IMH visit with Caregiver. He\nadvised Caregiver that he does not dictate or run the IMH visits, and\nthe IMH therapist does not dictate or run the parenting time visits\nand that Caregiver has to adhere to both visits.\nI interviewed Program Manager (PM) by telephone on 6/5/2024.\nPM affirmed both FCS’s and FCW’s reporting related to Child A’s,\nChild B’s, and Child C’s case plan being reunification. She reported\nthe agency had recommended return home for the children in April\n2024, but then new issues (as reported by FCS and FCW related to\nthe birth parent’s drug screen and the DHHS complaint) surfaced.\nPM denied the agency making any efforts to push adoption of the\nchildren by Caregiver. She reported FCS and FCW could better\naddress this allegation.\nDocument Review:\nChild A’s, Child B’s, and Child C’s MISACWIS case record showed:\n• The children’s case plan as reunification.\n• Service efforts by the agency with/for the birth parents;\ninclusive of substance abuse and therapist referrals, drug\n16",
    "testing, scheduling of parenting time visits.\n• Ongoing parenting times being scheduled/documented.\n• No indication of the agency advising Caregiver to not attend\nbirth parent parenting times or IMH visits.\nAnalysis Based on information from interviews and documentation reviewed,\nthe evidence does not substantiate the allegations or show a lack of\neffort by the agency to develop a plan of visitation and family time\nfor the children and ensuring their safety and wellbeing.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nContinuation of the agency current licensing status is recommended.\nJuly 30, 2024\n______________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 11, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n17"
