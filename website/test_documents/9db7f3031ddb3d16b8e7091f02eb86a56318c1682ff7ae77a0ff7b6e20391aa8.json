Administrator 1 reviewed\nthe video and reported that Staff 1 should have walked away from\nthe situation, but she did not. It was noted by Administrator 1 that\nStaff 1 was engaged aggressively. Administrator 1 did not\ndescribe this.\nStaff 1:\nStaff 1 reported she was scheduled as Youth A’s individual staff\non 10/27/24. Youth A is on a 1:1 supervision plan. Staff 1 reported\nYouth A was already agitated when she began her shift at\n3:00pm. Youth A started to target her and threaten her. Staff 1\nreported they were in the hallway and Youth A hit her and\ncontinued to name call her, threatening and raising his voice. Staff\n1 reported Supervisor 1 was in the area and intervened. Staff 1\nreported she raised her voice and said, “Don’t touch me. If you do\nthere are gonna be issues.” Staff 1 admitted this may have\nappeared threatening to Youth A. Staff 1 reported it was her first\ntime in this type of situation, and she felt that she used her\ntraining. Staff 1 reported she extended her arms to get Youth A\naway from her but felt that this movement was appropriate to\nprotect herself. Staff 1 and I watched the video of the incident\ntogether and Staff 1 was able to see she pushed Youth A and\nwalked towards him with her arm in the air. Staff 1 acknowledged\nshe pushed Youth A and should have disengaged from the\nsituation.\nYouth A:\nYouth A reported he did not remember the incident. Youth A\nreported he has never been hit, pushed, or yelled at by staff at the\nfacility.\n2",
    "Supervisor 1:\nOn 12/10/24 I interviewed Supervisor 1 via telephone. Supervisor\n1 reported she was involved in the situation on 10/27/24.\nSupervisor 1 reported Youth A hit Staff 1 in the hallway of the\nfacility. Supervisor 1 reported Staff 1 extended her arms out, but\ndid not push Youth A. Supervisor 1 reported Youth A kept\nattempting to attack Staff 1 and Staff 1 continued to stay in the\nsituation by moving towards Youth A. Supervisor 1 reported\nnormally staff would move away from the youth or the space.\nSupervisor 1 reported when Staff 1 extended her arms out\ntowards Youth A, it was an attempt to just keep Youth A away\nfrom her.\nVideo Observation:\nI reviewed the video for the incident. The date of the incident was\n10/27/24. The incident occurred at 6:19pm. Youth A and Staff 1\nare seen in the hallway of the facility. Youth A pushed Staff 1.\nStaff 1 pushed Youth A on the chest area and pushed his back as\nwell. Supervisor 1 is seen coming between them to separate\nYouth A from Staff 1. Youth A walked away and Staff 1 walked\ntowards Youth A, arm raised, verbalizing something. (No audio\nwas available, but it was clear based on facial movement Staff 1\nwas talking to Youth A).\nDocuments:\n• I reviewed Staff 1’s personnel file. Staff 1 was hired on\n6/1/24 and completed 167 hours of training, including CPI\nModule (2/20/24) Resident Management and Care (6/1/24),\nTrauma Responsive Care (9/27/24), and Developmental\nStages of Children (2/20/24). All Clearances are up to date\nfor Staff 1. Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary action in\nher file.\n• Youth A’s Behavioral Calming Plan was reviewed. Youth A\ndoes not like to hear the word, “No.” Youth A will become\nagitated and will become aggressive.\n• CPI Module was reviewed. CPI does not use pushing a\nyouth as non-violent intervention.\nAnalysis Based on the interview with Staff 1 and the video observation,\nStaff 1 pushed Youth A. Staff 1 has been trained in CPI and has\nbeen given the proper tools to use in this situation, but did not\nutilize them.\nConsultation:\nConsultation was offered that it may benefit the agency to use 1:1\nstaff/youth supervision as a training tool for newer staff. This\n3",
    "particular youth has a history of being assaultive and easily\ntriggered. Newer staff could possibly shadow 1:1’s during\norientation or even throughout the year to learn firsthand de-\nescalation techniques.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR2024SIC0001557 intake date 7/1/24; CAP Approved 11/4/24\nRule Code Intervention standards and prohibitions\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(iv) Verbal abuse including the use of derogatory or\ndiscriminatory language including negative references to a\nyouth's background or appearance or mental state.
