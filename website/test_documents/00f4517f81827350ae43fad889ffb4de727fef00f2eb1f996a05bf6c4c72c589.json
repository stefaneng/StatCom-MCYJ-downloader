EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD",
    "There were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during\nthis licensing period. This corrective action plan related to its 2024 Interim\ninspection where it received 21 rule and policy violations. In this year’s Renewal\ninspection, the agency received 22 rule violations. Of these 22 violations 7 are\nrepeat violations, with 5 being repeat violations from the 2024 Interim inspection.\nThe agency’s CAP compliance around these 5 rule violations is as follows: the\nnumber of individual cases cited remained the same with respect to 2 citations,\ndeceased on 2 other violations, and increased on the remaining 1 violation. A\nreview of the agency’s CAP showed it completed and or implemented all aspects\nof its corrective plan, but that implementation did not lend itself to complete\ncompliance.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator’s report dated 2/26/2025. The agency\nreported the agency has continued to experience workforce issues, around staff\nturnover, and most new staff coming with limited or no experience. With staff\nbeing less seasoned the agency reports it has been more challenging for them to\ntrain and have a higher expectation for the field. The chief administrator’s report\nindicated the agency also loss a key support person, their health care coordinator,\nwhom they had hired to aid workers around medicals, dentals and other areas.\nNotwithstanding these struggles the agency reported it has continued to train staff\naround compliance issues, and allowed staff to continued working hybrid\nschedules, all in an effort to offer flexibility to staff, limit stress, and help retain\nstaff.\nThe chief administrator’s report further indicated the agency’s corrective action\nplan brought about overall positive results. That staff are ultilizing department and\nagency resources to assist them. That staff’s increased utilization of outlook\ncalendars, and the Book of Business has resulted in improved organization, and\nawareness for staff to increase rule compliances. Additionally, their corrective\naction plan had held supervisors accountable for support to staff around\ndocumentation and task follow up. The agency plans to continue its efforts to\nimprove rule compliance and to increase staff retention.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a 2024-2025 annual budget and a copy of its 9/30/2024\nIndependent financial audit. A review of the documents showed the independent\nfinancial audit indicated the agency entered into an advance payment agreement.\nThe repayment is to commence 3/30/2025, with quarterly installments of. There\nwas no concern indicated in the audit related to the agency ability to reimburse",
    "these advances as outlined. Aside from this note in the financial audit report, no\nconcerns were observed.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to a discussion with the licensee designee, chief administrator, program\nmanager, and nine supervisory and administrative staff during the entrance\nconference, two foster care workers, a licensing worker, independent living worker\nand adoption worker were interviewed. Areas of strengths for the agency as\nreported by these workers included the agency’s efforts to be inclusive and\ndiverse; to provide good supervision; and to aid children and families to achieve\ngoals. Additionally, strengths included there being good agency communication,\nstrong teams and team work, and the chief administrator’s sincere and genuine\nconcern for workers. Areas of growth needed included ways to improve staff\nretention and minimize staff turnover; possibly obtaining an independent living\nhome to be able to offer greater independent living potentials to youths; and some\ntype of coordination and or communication with CWTI (Child Welfare Training\nInstitute) instructors around shadowing experiences so that new workers do not\nmiss out on these opportunities when scheduled at the agency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nNo safety issue or concerns were revealed during my onsite visit. The agency has\nspace and equipment for its staff, and stores files securely.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were two identified safety alerts.\nSafety Alert # 1: There were no operable smoke detectors on each level of\noccupancy. There was no operable carbon monoxide detector in the home.\nResolution: The agency reported the foster home has an operable carbon\nmonoxide/smoke detector on the second floor in the home in the hallway.\nAdditionally, as of 2/6/2025 the home has smoke detectors on each level of the\nhome. That all smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are brand new and\nin working order. Photos were provided.\nSafety Alert #2: There is no operable smoke detector in the basement.\nResolution: The agency provided photos and mentioned a video showing on\n2/24/2025 the smoke detector mounted in the basement and in working order.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.",
