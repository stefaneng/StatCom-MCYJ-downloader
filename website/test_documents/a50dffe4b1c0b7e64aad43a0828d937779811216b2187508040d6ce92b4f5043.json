INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12409 Education policy\nSection (1) An agency’s education policy shall ensure that, within 5 school\nDescription days of placement, an agency shall provide for the enrollment of\neach child of school age, as defined by state law, into a school\nprogram.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was not enrolled in school for almost two years while\nagency had case management responsibility.\nInvestigation History of Youth A.\nYouth A was placed into foster care October 23, 2019, with DHHS\nBerrien County having full management responsibility. He was\nplaced in the home of Foster Care 1 on 3/12/20, in Harper Woods,\nMI. Youth A, DOB 8/14/13 is a medically fragile youth with the\nfollowing diagnosis: Tuberous Sclerosis, Ash Leaf Spot,\nRefractory Infantile Spasms, Localization-related Symptomatic,\nEpilepsy and Epileptic Syndromes with Complex Partial Seizures,\nNot Intractable, Without Status Epilepticus and Developmental\nDelay. Youth A is not verbal, specific behaviors include being a\nfall risk (he is tethered to the caregiver majority of the day),\nunable to feed himself, food must be chopped into small pieces\notherwise he will cram food into his mouth and choke, does a lot\nof spitting, has worn a helmet at one time to prevent spitting, will\nattempt to stick his fingers in the caregiver’s mouth, wears\ndiapers, diapers must be checked often due to smearing/eating\nfecal matter. Youth A runs, he does not walk, he is up many hours\nof the night (which is why an assisted caregiver was assigned).\nHe is very unstable/unsteady and requires a lot of assistance to\nwalk, or he must be in a transport chair.\nDHHS Supervisor/Complainant was interviewed via telephone\non 5/8/2023. She reported other than what was already reported,\nshe did not have that much more to add. She said she was rather\ndisheartened that Youth A had not been in school while in foster\ncare with assigned DHHS agency and that the assigned foster\ncare worker at the time did not seem to verify thoroughly with\nFoster Parent 1 whether Youth A was actually enrolled in school.\n2",
    "Program Manager (PM) and Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) was\ninterviewed via TEAMS on 5/16/2023. She reported that Youth A\nwas assigned to three foster care specialists (FCS), two who no\nlonger work for the department. She reported that her agency had\nfull responsibility for Youth A’s case from October 23, 2019, until\n7/15/2022 when the case was transferred to a private agency. The\nProgram Manager said FCS 1 was assigned Youth A’s case from\n10/23/19 – 10/16/20, she no longer works for the department.\nFCS 2 was assigned Youth A’s case from 10/16/20 -12/7/20 and\nshe no longer works for the department. FCS 3 was assigned\nYouth A’s case from 12/7/20 -7/15/2022 at which time Youth A\nwas transferred to a private agency. The Program Manager\nreported she could only discuss the conversations she had with\nthe assigned workers at that time and refer to the social work\ncontacts during that time period regarding enrolling Youth A into\nschool. She said she reviewed 445 social work contacts which\nwere provided to this Consultant discussing school enrollment,\nhome schooling, numerous telephone calls to the Harper Woods\nschool district and conversations with Foster Parent 1. It was\nnoted in the social work contacts, and in the conversations with\nFoster Parent 1 allegedly with the school district that nothing was\nreviewed to indicate that Youth A was enrolled in school from the\ntime period of 10/23/2019 – 7/15/2022 while Berrien County\nDHHS had full responsibility for Youth A. The Program Manager\nsaid the FCS had some difficulties connecting with Harper Woods\nSchools and she remember having FCS 1 call the school district in\nfront of her because she just did not believe a school district would\nnot answer the telephone. The Program Manager said she also\nmade a special request for the FCS to contact the school liaison at\nthat time, but she was not 100% sure where that led. The\nProgram Manager concluded that she could not find anything in\nsocial works notes indicating that Youth A was ever enrolled in\nschool while in their care.\nThe Foster Care Supervisor agreed with what the Program\nManager said. She did not have any additional information to add.\nFoster Care Specialist 4 was interviewed on 5/31/2023 via\ntelephone. She is the current foster care specialist (FCS) for\nYouth A assigned to him from a private agency. She reported that\nher agency was assigned Youth A’s case effective July 18, 2022.\nShe said Youth A’s foster parent, (Foster Parent 1) is assigned to\nMidland/Gladwin DHHS and they have responsibility for FP 1’s\ncase. FCS 4 reported that Foster Parent 1 just recently had a\nspecial investigation conducted by another government agency\nregarding Youth A’s education issue. She said DCWL was\n3",
    "contacted due to information that was gained during their\ninvestigation about Youth A not attending school while placed with\nanother DHHS agency. I think FCS 4 reported that when her\nagency was assigned Youth A’s case, it was reported by Berrien\nDHHS that Youth A was participating in the Harper Woods Virtual\nAcademy online program. She said she reached out to the school\ndistrict to confirm this information and discovered that Youth A had\nnever been enrolled in the Harper Woods School district. FCS 4\nsaid she assisted in getting Youth A enrolled on 1/9/23 in the\nHarper Woods School District. She said after his initial\nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) was completed Youth A\nwas placed in Detroit Public Schools for services due to his high\nneeds. She reported that Youth A receives 2 hours of educational\ninstruction each week which are completed on Wednesday\nafternoons. A teacher goes into the home for Youth A’s schooling.\nShe said Youth A is supposed to receive physical therapy,\noccupational therapy, and speech through his IEP, however due\nto him not beginning home bound services until 05/13/2023, these\nservices will not start until next school year, they will be virtual,\nand the time for each will be determined next school year.\nDocumentation Reviewed:\n• Social work contacts- It was noted in the social work\ncontacts that the FCS’s with Berrien DHHS always inquired\nabout Youth A being enrolled in school and the foster\nparent always responded that Youth A was being home\nschooled, or that she was waiting on his previous school\npaperwork which included his IEP and school records.\nFinally, Foster Parent 1 reported that a teacher would be\ncoming to the home in the fall for the new school year.\nMost of the social work contacts stated that Foster Parent 1\nwas home schooling Youth A. The information about Youth\nA schooling was not followed up on by the assigned Berrien\nDHHS foster care specialists in the social work contacts.\nOne social work contact stated that the worker contacted\nHarper Woods School to inquire about getting Youth A\nenrolled into school but wrote there was no answer, and\nmessages were left several times on the telephone, but\nthere was no return call back. It was also noted that Foster\nParent 1 was not comfortable during this time period as it\nwas the height of the COVID Pandemic to allow people to\nenter into her home.\n• Youth A’s current IEP Report from Harper Woods dated\nMarch 2023. Youth A participated in testing and\nassessments.\n4",
    "• DHHS recommendation regarding their findings on Foster\nParent 1’s home dated 5/17/2023. DHHS completed a\nspecial evaluation regarding Foster Parent 1 failure to\nenroll Youth A in school. The report states, “on 3/12/20 the\nreasoning for not enrolling Youth A in school cannot be\ndetermined. It is documented by DHHS foster care on\n3/16/20 that Youth A was enrolled in Harper Woods virtual\nschool. Foster Parent 1 sent text messages documenting\nher efforts to get Youth A in school. The director of Harper\nWoods School special education program denied having\nknowledge of Youth A until having contact with Youth A’s\ncurrent Foster Care Specialist 4. FCS 4 reported that she\nhas been working with Harper Woods School and Detroit\nPublic School Districts since October of 2022 to get Youth\nA enrolled in school. The report continues by stating,\nFoster Parent 1 could have done more to enroll Youth A in\nsome form of schooling, DHHS does not investigate\ntruancy or educational neglect. A predisposition\nconference took place on 05/04/23. DHHS licensing worker\nhad no findings. Foster Care agreed that Youth A will\nremain in his current placement.”\n• Memorandum sent to this Consultant on 6/6/2023 by the\nProgram Manager acknowledging per policy that all foster\ncare youths are to be enrolled in school within five days of\nplacement.\nAnalysis In review of documentation, DHHS investigation report and\ninterviews with staff, Berrien County DHHS did not enroll Youth A\nin school while having responsibility over his case from\n10/23/2019 – 7/15/2022. CPA rule states that within 5 school\ndays of placement, an agency shall provide for the enrollment of\neach child of school age.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that Berrien County DHHS current license status be continued.\n______________________________________7/12/2023\nPinkey Brown Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n7/14/23\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n6"
