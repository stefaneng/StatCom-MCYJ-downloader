At a minimum, these SOPs must\ncontain the following requirements:\nAccess to Telephone and Authorized Charges\nYouths in residential care programs are permitted access to telephones.\nYouths are permitted to make at least two (2) telephone calls per week to parties\napproved by the youth, parents, JJS, CMO worker, or probation officer at\nestablished times.\nAn approved list of incoming and outgoing telephone calls is readily available to\nprogram staff.\nFacilities will allow for reasonable privacy of telephone calls within program\nparameters.\nStaff will not listen to an outside party’s portion of a telephone conversation without\nthe outside party’s consent or a court order.\nResident B was interviewed on 06/24/2019 at the facility.

    "Resident D was interviewed on 06/24/2019 at Bay Pines Center. Resident D said,\n“you give up a parent phone call to call your worker. She said that May 2019 is the\nlast month for this policy because of complaints by the residents. Resident D said\nthe boys’ side did not have to follow the same rule and they could call their workers\nwithout losing a family call.\nResident E was interviewed at the facility on 07/17/2019. She said you had to give\nup a family call if you were going to call your attorney.

They all said that phone calls were not an issue and the facility had set\ntelephone times for residents and phone calls to lawyers and workers were arranged\nby the group leaders.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4124 Communication\nAn institution shall have and follow a written policy regarding\ncommunication that ensures that a child is able to communicate\nwith family and friends in a manner appropriate to the child’s\nfunctioning and consistent with the child’s treatment plan and\nsecurity level.\nANALYSIS: Based on the Bureau of Juvenile Justice policy and the\ninterviews Bay Pines Center is following their required written\npolicy. The policy indicates youth are required to have at least\ntwo calls a week, which the youth report they were allowed, they\nwere just divided between workers and family.

The complaint by the other\nresidents was the Resident H was not put seclusion. There is no\nbehavior reported that warranted seclusion.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION 1:\nSomebody inside of Bay Pines Center wrote an email to the court saying how the\nresidents were being treated and ever since that they are mistreating them, even\nmore.

Resident A did not say\nwhy she thought something was wrong with Teacher 4.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nStaff qualifications.\nR 400.4112\n(1) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\nANALYSIS: Allegation 1:\nThere is insufficient evidence based on interviews with residents\nto establish that staff are mistreating or talking poorly to\nresidents.\nAllegation 2:\nThe teacher was not available to be interviewed. However,\nFormer Administrator 3 reported interviewing the teacher about\nthese allegations and denied saying anything inappropriate and\ndid not recall the marker being thrown at him. Interviews with\nResidents indicate that a marker may have been thrown at the\nteacher, but other than the girls’ speculations about how the\nteacher felt about this, there is no evidence to support anything\nimproper occurred.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nResidents are only allowed to be in their rooms for up to 72 hours, but they left a\nresident, Resident A, in her room for 85 hours.",
    "INVESTIGATION:\nFormer Administrator 3 did an internal investigation of the above allegation and\nprovided the following narrative:\nReviewed the girl’s logbook from 6/4/2019 regarding the concern (f) about a\nyouth being in their room for over 72 hours. The logbook reflects on 6/3/2019 at\n7:15pm Resident A cussed saying “fuck” at which time she was asked to circle\nup. Resident A began being disrespectful during the circle and was given a 15-\nminute chair restriction. Resident A then asked to self-step as Resident A tends\nto do this to avoid taking responsibility. Resident A was told no and demanded\nfor Staff 6 to call the supervisor. Staff 6 told Resident A no at which time\nResident A grabbed for Staff 6’s radio. Resident A was placed in her room for\nthe night. The next morning at 6:14am Resident A was at her door asking to\ncome out and was told not at that time and Resident A began swearing.\nResident A then proceeded to cover her window. When shift supervisor went to\ngive Resident A her due process paperwork indicating that she had a 24 hour\nand was given her breakfast at which time, she shoved her breakfast at staff and\nbegan charging staff. Resident A was restrained and due to this and placed on a\n72 hour due process. Resident A began working her exit strategy 6/7/19 at\n6:17am.\nAccording to MiSACWIS (Michigan Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information\nSystem), Resident A was placed in seclusion on 06/03/2019 at 7:15 p.m. and was\nreleased from seclusion on 06/06/2019 at 8:30 pm. The reason for seclusion was\nstated as Assault by Child Without Injury, Misconduct, and Physical Restraint. The\nMiSACWIS narrative was as follows:\nStaff 7 had Resident A's door open speaking to her. Staff 7 and Staff 8 were\nbeing aware of conversation. Before Resident A’s door was shut Staff 8 tried to\npass youth Resident A her breakfast. Resident A shoved her tray into staff while\ncharging at staff. Resident A was restrained, and Resident A's room was emptied\nas Resident A had covered her window. Resident A was on a DRC (Disciplinary\nRoom Confinement) at the time of this incident.\nResident A was interviewed on 07/23/2019 she said she was left locked in her room\nfor 85 hours.\nResident B was interviewed on 07/17/2019 she said Resident A was in her room for\n85 hours.\nThe Bureau of Juvenile Justice policy was reviewed and states that a resident is not\nto be confined in their locked bedroom for longer than 72 hours. In the above\nincident with Resident A, was confined for a longer period.",
    "Former Administrator 3, in her report regarding these allegations, wrote the+\nfollowing:\nUpon looking into this allegation, it appears that (Resident A) was placed in her\nroom on 6/3/19 at 7:15pm for 24 hours on a Due Process. Then on 6/4/19\n(Resident A) charged at staff and was given a 72 hour. I am concerned with this\nas she was already in her room and the 72 hours was added on to the time and\nshe began her exit strategy on 6/7/19 at 6:17am. This will be addressed with\nsupervisors during the August monthly supervisor meeting.\nResident B was re-interviewed on 01/28/2020, she said she never heard of a\nproblem with toilet paper when Resident A was in her room for 85 hours.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4163 Secure facilities serving juvenile justice youth; seclusion\nroom\n(2) The institution shall establish and follow a written policy,\nwhich, at a minimum, includes all of the following:\n(d) A sanction of room confinement shall not exceed 72\nhours inclusive of any time spent in seclusion for out-of-\ncontrol behavior at the time of the incident itself.\nSanctions of 72 hours shall be reserved for only the most\nserious misconduct.\nANALYSIS: In the above incident with Resident A, Former Administrator 3’s\nreport is that Resident A was confined on 06/03/2019 at 7:15pm.\nStaff then added a 72-hour room confinement on 06/04/2019 at\n6:14 a.m, while Resident A was already confined to her room.\nResident was released on 06/07/2019 at 6:17 a.m. Therefore,\nthe 72-hour time limit was exceeded by 11 hours and 2 minutes,\nas the rule indicates that the maximum time is 72-hours\ninclusive of any time spend in seclusion at the time of the\nincident itself.\nThe report in MiSACWIS states Resident A was placed in\nseclusion on 06/03/2019 at 7:15 p.m. and the time out was listed\nas 06/06/2019 at 8:30 p.m., for a total of 73 hours and 15\nminutes.\nTherefore, regardless of how the time is calculated, Resident A\nwas confined beyond 72-hours.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED",
    "ALLEGATION:\nA resident showed their private parts to Resident A and staff didn't do anything about\nit.\nINVESTIGATION:\nResident A was interviewed at the facility on 07/23/2019. She said that Resident B\nshowed her breast and vaginal area to her. Resident A said that all the girls on the\nunit and the staff knew about it.\nResident A said that this occurred on the “pod” and Resident B exposed herself to\nResident A as Resident A looked in the window of Resident B’s bedroom door.\nResident B was interviewed at Bay Pines Center on 06/24/2019. She said she\nexposed herself to Resident A and the staff “put her blocker up”. A blocker is a cover\nto the window on the bedroom door. Resident B went on to say that exposing herself\nto peers is one of her problems and she is working on it. Resident B was re-\ninterviewed on 01/28/2020. She said that Resident A looked into her room when she\nwas naked. She said she “stopped doing all that”.\nResident B’s case record documents were reviewed on 01/01/2020. According to the\ncase record Resident B has a long history of trauma and acting out behaviors. It was\nreported that she has made over 50 allegations that she was a victim of sexual\nabuse. The case plan is to have Resident B participate in Eye Movement\nDesensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\nand Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). The “blocker” in the window of the\nresident’s bedroom door is used when privacy is required, during normal time and\nsleeping hours the window is not blocked to provide supervision and safety.\nA safety plan was reviewed, dated 05/28/2019 and signed by Resident B. One the\nelements was “(Resident B) gave a verbal commitment to not show any of her body\nparts including breast and vagina to staff or youth.” The safety plan also specified\nthat Resident B’s door window blocker was to remain down (so staff could see into\nthe room) unless Resident B asked permission when she was changing her clothes\nor using the bathroom.\nBay Pines Center is a secure treatment center in which the residents are secure in a\nlocked bedroom during sleeping hours. Resident can also voluntary go to their\nrooms. The rooms have a magnetic lock which staff use a card or key fob to open\nthe rooms. The staff are required to do contact room checks when a resident is in his\nor her room. The privacy blocker that covers the window must be down so the staff\ncan check for the wellbeing of the resident.
