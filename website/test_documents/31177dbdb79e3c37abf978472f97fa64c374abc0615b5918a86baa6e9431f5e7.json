Footage is reviewed for\nSeptember 21, 2023, and no one is seen entering bedroom of Youth D.\nMission Ranch Supervision Program Policy – Policy indicated\nthat it is the expectation of the Prism Project that all staff will engage in\nactive supervision at all times. This includes but is not limited to the\nfollowing: A. Having knowledge of the residents’ whereabouts at all\ntimes is critical and is balanced with allowing the residents a certain\namount of privacy. As a resident is able to be more responsible and\ndependable, the supervision becomes less frequent or necessary.\nThese decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, by the individual\nresident’s care team and with the safety of the resident as the most\nimportant deciding factor. B. When youth are transitioning from one\nactivity to another (including but not limited to school, meals, group\ntherapy, etc) the direct care staff will conduct a head count of the youth\nto ensure that all youth are accounted for during the transition to class\neach day. Headcount will be recorded for accountability. C.

    "as required by policy. She stated she has seen Staff 7 go into\nYouth D’s room alone to confirm that Youth D was still there and\nindicated it was because she did not want to wait on the other\nstaff.\nOn 10/05/2023 an in-person meeting was held with CA. The\nDHHS specialist was also present. CA reported Youth D has\nmentioned having suicidal ideations and when she does ED or CA\nwill be contacted. An ASQ suicide screening will be completed\nand then a virtual call will be held with GHS. CA reported staff are\nasked but not required to contact administration prior to calling\n911 to help problem solve.

Staff 7\nreported this occurred a couple days after Youth D had gone\nAWOL, so she was anxious and wanted to make sure she was in\nher room.\nDocuments Reviewed\nMission Ranch Bed/Night Check Policy – Indicates when doing\nbed checks staff should be sure to actually see a body part (arm, leg,\nhead, face). If you do not see a body part, communicate with your\ncoworker - have them come to the bedroom door, you go in and pull the\ncovers back and make sure that the resident is in her bed while your\ncoworker stands at the doorway as a witness.\nMission Ranch Video Footage – On 9/20/2023 review of video\nfootage between 11pm and 7am documented that Staff 2 went into the\nbedroom of Youth D without another staff person present for\napproximately two seconds.\nHR file of Staff 7 – Employee has disciplinary action for being tardy in\nthe form of documentation of a verbal reprimand and write ups for\nvaping in the driveway and using profanity when talking about the youth.\nTechnical Assistance\nThe agency needs to review and revise AWOL policy to prevent delay in\nLaw Enforcement notification as policy currently allows up to 60 minutes\nto allow for search of the youth on the property of Mission Ranch. The\nlarge size of the ranch property is acknowledged, however immediate\nnotification once a youth is missing is critical to their safety and well-\nbeing.\n9",
    "Analysis At the conclusion of the investigation, there was not sufficient\nevidence to determine non-compliance with licensing rule\n4109(1)(c) relevant to lack of supervision that would allow\nsomeone to enter the room of Youth D and sexually assault her.\nThere was no evidence to support that anyone has entered the\nroom of Youth D and sexually assaulted her or snapped her bra.\nVideo that was reviewed did not show any staff entering the room\nof Youth D on any of possible days she reported. All staff\ninterviewed denied touching the youth inappropriately and law\nenforcement also closed their case after the investigation.\nHowever, at the conclusion of the investigation, there was\nsufficient evidence to determine non-compliance with licensing\nrule 4109 (1)(c) relevant to staff failing to follow the agency\nsupervision policy during the midnight schedule. Interviews of\nstaff revealed that staff violated policy and entered the bedroom of\nYouth D during the midnight shift alone.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\nSIR# 2023C0000453, CAP Approved 07/18/2023\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures.\nSection Rule 142.
