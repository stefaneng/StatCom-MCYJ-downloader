    "Pictures\nAnother Department of Health and Human Service forwarded pictures of Youth A’s\ninjuries taken by his father reportedly on 02/14/2022 after school.\n Picture 1 - Youth A has a round scab in the middle of his upper forehead and\nan abrasion on his left cheek.\n Picture 2 - Youth A has an abrasion on the base of his right thumb.\n Picture 3 - Youth A has an abrasion below his right shoulder blade.\nLocal law enforcement was notified of this allegation, Lahser Respite Home staff did\nnot provide an explanation or report the bruises on Youth A’s face, back and hands\nafter his 02/17/22 to 02/21/22 stay at Lahser Respite Home.\nAnother Department of Health and Human Service agency conducted an\ninvestigation without findings.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4126 Sufficiency of staff.\nThe licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nsupervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these\nadministrative rules and in the agency’s program statement and\nto provide for the continual needs, protection, and supervision of\nresidents.\n5",
    "ANALYSIS: Lahser Respite Home staff saw a mark on Youth A’s forehead\nas early as 02/12/22, but there is not documentation of when\nand how the marked occurred. Teacher stated witnessing Youth\nA bite the base of his thumb in class on 02/14/22 and saw the\nmark on Youth A’s forehead on 02/14/22. Youth A’s mark under\nhis right shoulder blade is unknown because Lahser Respite\nHome staff and Teacher did not lift up Youth A’s shirt to inspect\nfor marks. It cannot be determined if the abrasion on Youth A’s\nleft cheek occurred at Lahser Respite Home, at school or at his\nhome. Based on the interviews it is found that Lahser Respite\nHome did not provide for the needs, protection, and supervision\nof Youth A by monitoring him and documenting how he obtained\nthe mark on his forehead.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nThere is to be a shift change report either verbally or written to\nfacilitate the needs of the youth in care.\nInjuries are to be documented in an incident report or in the\nyouth’s progress note on the date of the incident or the date the\ninjury is found.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nThe continuance of a regular license is recommended upon receipt of an approved\ncorrective action plan.\n03/21/2022\n________________________________________\nVivian D.
