CONSULTATION\nThe facility was offered consultation in the following areas:\n• There was no consultation requested or required.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows: The\nagency Renewal inspection was completed on 2/16/23 and the CAP was\napproved on 2/21/23. The agency was cited for 9 violations, 4 of which were\nrepeated this year. Of those 4, there was an improvement in individual incidents of\nnon-compliance within 2 of the violation areas and a slight increase in number of\nindividual incidents in the other 2 areas. In 2023, 12 violations were established, 7\nof which were repeated this year. All of the repeated violations remain close to the\nsame number of individual incidents of non-compliances. The agency will need to\n6",
    "establish additional corrective planning for the repeated violations to ensure a\nreduction of incidents.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator assessment was received and reviewed. The agency\nnoted barriers due to a limited number of medical and dental providers willing to\naccept youth insurance. In addition, some providers have been hesitant to provide\nthe required paperwork which led to a delay in uploading the related paperwork in\na timely manner. The assessment noted the ongoing file reviews that take place\nas a result of previous year’s CAP. This occurs as a group once per month and\nhas resulted in noticeable improvement. The agency also utilizes protected time\nfor staff to complete data entry, and this has been helpful in working toward\ncompliance.\nFinancial Overview\nThere are no financial concerns identified based on the review of the facility's\nbudget and the agency's financial audit.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nInterviews were conducted with three staff via telephone. Staff reported feeling\nsupported by the agency. Supervisors and coworkers are available to assist as\nneeded. The agency communicates relevant updates in a timely manner. Staff did\nnot report any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency maintains sufficient office space, equipment and supplies to ensure\ndelivery of foster care and licensing. All files were stored securely and there is a\ncross shredder for CHRI.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe agency is not contracted with MDHHS to provide foster care placement or\ncertification services, therefore this is not applicable.\n7",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_________10/15/2025_______________________\nMelinda Gubbins Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 20, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n8"
