    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code Health services; policies and procedures.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and behavioral\nhealth care.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Allegation 1: Facility did not provide appropriate medical care to\nYouth S relative to nose bleeds and blood pressure.\nAllegation 2: Facility lacks behavioral health care policies and\nprocedures.\nInvestigation ALLEGATION 1\nInterviews:\nI interviewed Midnight Team Leader by phone on 3/22/24. She\nwas hired as a direct care worker and promoted to a Team Leader\non 1/14/24. She denied she is a nurse, physician, or other trained\nmedical professional. She said she works in Myriam and DeRoy\nHalls from 11pm – 7:30am, and occasionally works in other\nbuildings and other shifts.\nMidnight Team Leader said Youth S has nose bleeds that last 15\n– 45 minutes. She consulted with Vista Maria’s nurse for one of\nthe nosebleeds and the nurse instructed Complainant to hold a\ncold wet towel over Youth S’ nose, which Complainant did. Team\nLeader said she has also consulted the nurse about the youth’s\nswollen feet and a nurse told her the medical team was aware and\nthere was nothing they could do about it. Team Leader feels the\nmedical staff should take the youth’s symptoms more seriously.\nI notified Youth S’s Foster Care Worker that I was assigned to\ninvestigate the allegation. She expressed no licensing concerns.\nI interviewed Youth S jointly with Government Worker 1. She said\nshe has frequent nosebleeds, which she believes are caused by a\nlack of humidity. Youth S said when her nose bleeds, staff apply\nice and cold towels to it, then a nurse sees her and asks\nquestions. Asked about her swollen feet, Youth S stated, “I may\nhave high blood pressure…It runs in my family. The nurse told\n2",
    "me to soak my feet in Epson salt.” Youth S confirmed that in\naddition to nurses, she spoke to her primary physician about her\nnosebleeds.\nI interviewed Nurse jointly with Government Worker 1. She was\naware that Youth S has nosebleeds and when she is notified and\npresent, she responds in person. Whether Nurse responds to\nYouth S in person or via telephone triage, she said she instructs\nstaff to put ice over the bridge of her nose to stop the bleeding.\nNurse said the youth is prescribed a saline nasal spray and gel for\nthe nosebleeds.\nNurse is also aware Youth S’ blood pressure is sometimes high\nand that she has swollen feet. Most recently on 4/1/24, she said\nYouth S was seen by Vista Maria’s medical doctor for blood\npressure and pain in her feet. Nurse said possible causes for the\npain in her feet were/are related to wearing shoes that were too\nsmall and carrying excess body weight. It was recommended\nYouth S lose weight and exercise to increase the circulation in her\nfeet.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed nursing telephone triage notes on 2/29/24 and 3/4/24\ninstructing staff how to respond to Youth S’ nosebleeds.\nI reviewed medical notes showing Youth S was seen by a nurse\nand doctor on 3/4/24. The note for her doctor’s visit on 4/1/24 was\nnot yet completed according to the nurse.\nALLEGATION 2\nInterviews:\nCounter to the allegations made, Midnight Team Leader said Vista\nMaria does have policies and procedures instructing staff on ways\nto respond to youths who engage in self-harmful behaviors,\nexpress suicidal ideation, gestures and attempts. Upon interview\nMidnight Team Leader was aware of multiple interventions to\nprevent suicide and self-harm including, but not limited to, clearing\nthe youth’s bedroom of harmful objects, increasing staff proximity\nand level of supervision, preventing active self-harm by physically\nremoving harmful items from a youth and transporting the youth to\na hospital for a psychiatric crisis assessment if needed. The issue\nwas Team Leader believes Vista Maria should develop a new\npolicy to eliminate self-harm by prohibiting all small, sharp and\nmetal objects such as staples, safety pins, tacks, paper clips,\npens, pencils, screws, plastic, strings, glass windows and glass\n3",
    "nail polish and anything else a youth could ingest or scratch\nagainst her skin.\nDocuments reviewed:\nSuicide Prevention Policy\nSuicide Prevention Work Instructions\nEmergency Psychiatric Care Policy\nEmergency Psychiatric Care Work Instructions\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis ALLEGATION 1\nMedical records as well as Youth P and Nurse 1 indicated Youth P\nis receiving routine and timely medical care for nosebleeds and\nswollen feet/ankles.\nALLEGATION 2\nThe licensing rule requires the facility to establish and follow\nwritten policies and procedures addressing behavioral health care.\nIn reviewing the policies and work instructions pertaining to\nbehavioral health care, I confirmed written policies and procedures\nare established and no changes are necessary or recommended.\nComplainant’s suggestion to eliminate all small objects from each\nbuilding that could be ingested or used to scratch the skin is not\nrealistic.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Sufficiency of staff.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4126\nSection The licensee shall have a sufficient number of administrative,\nDescription supervisory, social service, direct care, and other staff on duty to\nperform the prescribed functions required by these administrative\nrules and in the agency’s program statement and to provide for\nthe continual needs, protection, and supervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth S self-harms and was given razors by unidentified staff.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nYouth P resides in Myriam Hall. In early February 2024, Midnight\nTeam Leader said Youth P cut her thighs with a razor and then\n4",
    "swallowed the razor. Team Leader assumed staff must have\nprovided Youth P with a razor to shave. She said Youth P was\ntreated at the hospital and returned to Vista Maria. Three weeks\nlater, Team Leader assumed Youth P swallowed another razor\nwhich, she also assumed was provided to her by staff to complete\nhygiene. Youth P was treated again at the hospital. Team Leader\nassumed Youth P was on heightened staff supervision when she\nobtained the second razor and believes a staff at Vista Maria is at\nfault for providing her a razor.\nI notified Youth P’s Foster Care Worker that I was assigned to\ninvestigate the allegation. She expressed no additional concerns.\nI interviewed Youth P jointly with Government Worker 1. She has\nbeen at the facility for nine months. Prior to being placed at Vista\nMaria, Youth P said she swallowed razor blades and glass at least\nfive other times. Youth P said no staff at Vista Maria provided her\nwith a razor. Rather, on 2/2/24, she stole a small wooden pencil\nsharpener from school and brought it back to Deroy Hall. That\nnight after showering in the bathroom, she said she snapped the\npencil sharpener open and ingested two square ½” blades that\nwere inside. Youth P said she swallowed the blades sitting alone\non the toilet with the door closed while an unidentified staff person\nwas monitoring her outside the bathroom. At that time, she said\nshe was not on “observations” or any other heightened level of\nstaff supervision. Youth P denied the blades hurt going down.\nBut shortly after, she experienced stomach pain and coughed\nblood into a napkin. That is when Youth S informed an\nunidentified staff what she had done, and Vista Maria transported\nher to a hospital. “I was suicidal,” she explained. Asked what it\nmeans to be suicidal, Youth P said it means she wants to kill\nherself and has or is in the process of devising a plan.\nWhen Youth P returned to Vista Maria after swallowing razors on\n2/2/24, she said she was placed on “observations” and 1:1\nstaffing, but gradually earned her way off of “observations.”\nYouth P also denied Vista Maria staff provided her with a razor on\n3/4/24. Rather that day on 3/4/24, while not under heightened\nstaff supervision, she said she stole two needles from a sewing kit\nstored in the recreation cabinet and stole a Bic razor from the\nunlocked hygiene closet without anyone noticing. She took the\nneedles and razor into the bathroom, snapped open the\ndisposable razor, removed the blade and swallowed both needles\nand the blade.\n5",
    "I interviewed Team Leader 1 jointly with Government Worker 1\nand Rights Officer present. She has worked at the facility for eight\nyears. About six months ago, she said the building was cleared of\ndisposable razors in anticipation of admitting higher acuity youth.\nTeam Leader said electric razors are provided and denied the\nbuilding currently carries or provides disposable razors to the\nyouths.\nI interviewed Team Leader 2 jointly with Government Worker 1\nand Rights Officer present via Teams. She said she worked in the\nbuilding on 2/2/24 and 3/4/24 when Youth P swallowed foreign\nobjects. Team Leader 2 could not recall the details of each\nincident. “I wouldn’t have been directly supervising the girls.\nFormer Staff 2 made me aware it happened. I don’t remember\nwhat Former Staff 2 said. Apparently, Youth P told an unidentified\nstaff she broke a bottle of nail polish and swallowed glass, but\nthere were no bottle remnants or smell left behind. No one knows\nwhat she swallowed.”\nTeam Leader 2 stated youths are not searched before entering\nthe bathroom and the bathroom door must be shut completely for\nprivacy purposes. She insisted “Youths are never given a Bic\nrazor.”\nOn 4/3/24 Government Worker 1 and I attempted to interview\nFormer Staff 2 jointly via phone conference. Former Staff 2\nscheduled a phone appointment for later that day and did not\nanswer when called.\nOn 4/3/24, Rights Officer reported the video in Myriam Hall was\nonly maintained for 21 days and thus, there is no footage to view\nthat may show Youth P entering the hygiene closet on 3/4/24.\nTour Observations:\nI observed the recreation cabinet, hygiene closet and youth\nbathroom in DeRoy Hall. There were electric razors, but no\ndisposable ones in the closet. The hygiene closet is usually\nlocked but was unlocked at the time I observed it because a staff\nwas in the process of stocking it. The recreation cabinet itself\ndoes not lock but is located inside a locked area of the building.\nDocuments reviewed:\nI reviewed the Client Observation policy and work instructions.\nThey do not include staff supervising youths on the toilet. There is\nno policy that prohibits pencil sharpeners in the school or needles\nin sewing kits.\n6",
    "I reviewed the Back to Basics – Guidelines, Expectations and Rules\nfor Campus-Wide Vista Maria Staff related to supervising youth in\nthe bathroom. The guidelines indicate staff should properly\nsupervise clients while in the bathroom. Staff must maintain a\nposition inside the bathroom if two or more clients are present.\nThere was no reliable document to review that identified what\nlevel of staff supervision Youth P was on at any given point in\nhistory, specifically on the day of 2/2/24 and 3/4/24 prior to her\nswallowing foreign objects.\nThe charter school on Vista Maria’s campus called Clara B Ford is\nnot run by Vista Maria and does not specifically prohibit items\nsuch as pencil sharpeners.\nAn incident report dated 2/2/24 at 8pm indicates during a suicide\nrisk assessment conducted in DeRoy Hall, Youth P admitted\ncutting her left forearm and both inner thighs with a razor blade,\nthen swallowing the razor blade in the bathroom. Youth P was\ntransported to the hospital.\nI reviewed a medical report from Beaumont Hospital emergency\nroom that indicated Youth P was seen on 2/2/24 for a suicide\nattempt. The physician indicated patient presented after allegedly\nswallowing razor blades from a pencil sharpener. She had\nmultiple superficial lacerations to her wrist and anterior thighs.\nThere was no oral injury, but x-ray confirmed 2 small metallic\nappearing objects near the gastric region consistent with the\nhistory of alleged ingestion.\nAn incident report dated 3/4/24 at 8:47pm indicates Youth P said\nshe cut her wrist, thighs and swallowed two razor blades and\nneedles in the bathroom. Youth P said she broke her personal\nshaver in the bathroom to get the razor blades and took the\nneedles off a teacher’s desk.\nI reviewed a medical report from Garden City Hospital emergency\nroom indicating Youth P was seen on 3/4/24 for suicide attempt,\nswallowing foreign body. Chest x-ray showed two linear foreign\nbodies in the stomach measuring 1.5 cm and 2.6 cm. Treating\nphysician indicated Youth P presented after swallowing pins and\nrazor blade as stated by patient. Abdominal and chest x-ray show\npins…Patient states she still wants to kill herself…Notes\nhallucinations of seeing her parents around her. Psych\nclearances ordered. Psych and social work consulted…\nDiscussed case with GI children’s and they stated as long as there\n7",
    "was no razor blade noted by radiologist there is no need to\ntransfer patient and patient can stool them out…Patient will be\nmonitored until she stools out the pins. Pending discharge after\npsych evaluation.\nGovernment Worker 1 had no findings.\nAnalysis On 2/2/24 Youth P told a physician she swallowed two blades\nfrom a broken pencil sharpener. An x-ray showed two small\nmetallic objects in her gastric region. Youth P said she took the\npencil sharpener off a teacher’s desk without permission, but what\nshe swallowed and where she obtained it cannot be determined.\nOn 3/4/2 Youth P told a physician she swallowed razor blades and\nneedles/pins she took off a teacher’s desk. An x-ray showed two\nlinear foreign bodies in her stomach. On 3/26/24 Youth P told\ninvestigators she snuck a disposable razor out of the hygiene\ncloset and took two needles from a sewing kit. Again, what she\nactually swallowed and how she obtained the items cannot be\ndetermined.\nYouth P intentionally did not let staff know her plans to swallow\nforeign objects prior to doing it and denied that any of the items\nshe swallowed were provided to her by staff. Rather she admitted\nshe planned and took these items from unauthorized areas and/or\nwithout permission with the intention of ingesting them later when\nalone on the toilet in the bathroom.\nThe Client Observation policy and work instructions do not include\nstaff supervising youths on the toilet. There is no policy that\nprohibits pencil sharpeners in the school or needles in sewing kits.\nYouth P confirmed that staff were supervising her outside of the\nbathroom according to policy each time she swallowed foreign\nobjects. There is no evidence staff failed to provide appropriate\nsupervision.\nCONSULTATION\nTo better track a youth’s supervision needs, I recommended to the\nQuality Assurance Director that clinical staff begin maintaining a\nrunning document of the date, time, type of precaution/supervision\nyouths are placed on, and the reason, as well as the date, time\nand reason the youth was removed from that type or level of\nsupervision/precaution.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n8",
    "Rule Code Behavior management\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4157\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written policies and\nDescription procedures that describe the institution’s behavior management\nsystem. The policies and procedures shall be reviewed annually\nand updated as needed. These shall be available to all residents,\ntheir families, and referring agencies.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Facility lacks behavior management policies and procedures.\nInvestigation Interview:\nMidnight Team Leader acknowledged Vista Maria does indeed\nhave written behavior management policies and procedures.\nHowever, she said in her opinion, the physical restraint moves\ntaught by current behavior management system (Crisis Prevention\nInstitute - CPI) “are not as effective” as other restraint moves\ntaught by other models in other facilities. After licensing rules\nprohibited behavior management rooms in November 2022,\nMidnight Team Leader believes the facility needs to use a different\nbehavior management model that teaches more physical restraint\nmoves than currently taught in CPI.\nDocuments reviewed:\nBehavior Management Policy\nBehavior Management Work Instructions\nNon-violent Crisis Intervention (CPI Handbook)\nAnalysis The licensing rule requires the facility to establish and follow\nwritten policies and procedures that describe the institution’s\nbehavior management system. The facility has a behavior\nmanagement policy and work instructions, and uses CPI, a model\napproved by DCWL. Mandating a different model or requiring\nadditional restraint moves is beyond the scope of DCWL and not\nrecommended at this time.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n9",
    "Rule Code Staff to resident ratio\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4127\nSection (3) The ratio formula for direct care workers shall correspond with\nDescription the institution’s purpose and the needs of the residents and shall\nassure the continual safety, protection, and direct care and\nsupervision of residents.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Facility runs a staffing ratio of 1:8\nInvestigation Interview:\nIn terms of running a ratio of 1:8, Midnight Team Leader stated\nthis applied to sleeping hours on the midnight shift. However, she\nbelieves the ratio of staff to residents during sleeping hours should\nbe higher than 1:8. During waking hours, she confirmed they run a\n1:3 ratio which is consistent with their program statement.\nDocument reviewed:\nI reviewed the facility’s program statement which indicates a 1:3\nstaff to resident ratio during waking hours and 1:10 staff to\nresident ratio during sleeping hours.\nAnalysis A 1:8 staff to resident ratio during sleeping hours is compliant with\nthe facility’s program statement and this licensing rule.\nCONSULTATION\nI encouraged Complainant to express her opinions and ideas for\nchanges internally to her supervisor and managers at Vista Maria.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\n10",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nApril 22, 2024\n______________________________________\nDeborah Will Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nApril 29, 2024\n________________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n11"
