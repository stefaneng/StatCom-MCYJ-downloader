DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS\nThe facility is in compliance with all applicable licensing statutes and rules except for\nthe following:\nFOM 722-06B Family Team Meeting\nThe DHHS-1105, Family Team Meeting Report,\nmust be completed for every FTM.\nOne of six foster care files had a FTM without a completed 1105 report.\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following areas:\n• Borrowed beds- The agency was provided with the business process for\nmanaging borrowed beds in CWLM.\n• Parent Agency Treatment Plans- When PATPs are provided to parent/foster\nparents via mail, the foster care worker must also document attempts to\nobtain a signature on the PATP.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were two substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\n• One special evaluation found that a foster parent changed the formula of a\nmedically fragile child, without permission. This foster parent was providing respite",
    "care and had been fully trained on the child's needs. Revocation of the license was\nrecommended.\n• The second special evaluation was due to allegations a foster parent exposed\nhimself and made inappropriate comments to a foster child. Revocation of the\nlicense was recommended.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted one acceptable corrective action plan (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nThe CAP, approved 10/4/22, was the result of the 9/25/22 interim evaluation. The\nCAP addressed one violation regarding participation of parents/foster parents in\ndevelopment of treatment plans. During the current review it was determined the\nagency is in compliance with their CAP. No repeat violations were found.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) was reviewed and discussed. The\nCAA indicated the agency successfully implemented their 10/4/22 CAP. The\nagency utilized the quality improvement team, training, and the Book of Business\nto monitor compliance with the CAP. During this review, there were no repeat\nviolations found. The Chief Administrator reported that the number of foster care\ncases is moving in a downward trend across the county. Likely due to increased\nservices to maintain kids in their home of origin. The agency reported some\ndifficulties over the past year with retaining and hiring staff, placement\nemergencies, and an overall lack of response from some clients regarding visits\nand parenting time. Despite this, the agency continues to maintain a high level of\ncompliance.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\nStaff Interviews\nTwo staff were interviewed. Both staff reported being with the agency for over a\nyear. Both staff stated they enjoy their jobs and have excellent supervisors. One\nstaff reported some challenges this year included new licensing rules, learning a\nnew computer system for licensing, and a new system for foster parent inquiries.\nHowever, staff reported feeling supported and having the resources needed.\nNeither staff had any concerns or recommendations for how to improve the\nagency.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same building as the 2022 review. The\nbuilding is easily accessible and has sufficient space for staff and clients. The\noffice has adequate locking storage for confidential materials.",
    "VII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no identified safety concerns.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency will be issued a renewal of their regular license.\n_ ___________October 9, 2023_________________________\nHeather Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 13, 2023\n_____________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager"
