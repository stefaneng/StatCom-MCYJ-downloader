INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327\nSection (3) An agency shall complete a special evaluation within 45\nDescription calendar days after receipt of the information. If additional time is\n1",
    "required, then the agency shall inform the foster parent, in writing,\nof the basis for the extension and the expected length of the\nextension. The total time for the completion of the investigation\nmay not exceed 90 calendar days without written approval from\nthe chief administrator or his or her designee.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation The agency opened a special evaluation on a foster home and\nhave not completed any work on that special evaluation, though\nthe agency has completed the foster home's renewal or annual\ninspection. There is concern the agency is intentionally delaying\nthe completion of the special evaluation to delay the transfer of the\nhome.\nInvestigation Interviews\nComplainant\nOn 1/2/2025 I interviewed Complainant about these allegations by\ntelephone. Complainant reported the agency called in a children\nservices complaint related to the licensed foster home in mid-\nOctober of 2024, and did not initiate the special evaluation until\nNovember 2024. Additionally, since November nothing more has\nbeen entered into CWLM (Child Welfare Licensing Module)\nsystem. Complainant reported per their contact with the agency, in\nDecember 2024, the agency had no findings related to the special\nevaluation, but there is nothing in CWLM. Also, Agency Worker\n(AW) reported she is the assigned worker for the special\nevaluation, but nothing was completed in the CWLM system by\nAW. Complainant reported the agency completed the foster\nfamily’s renewal inspection, but the agency still has not started the\nspecial evaluation. Complainant reported AW had reported she\nwas working on the narrative for the special evaluation and she\nhad an extension for the special evaluation.\nChief Administrator (CA & Agency Worker (AW)\nI spoke with CA and AW briefly by telephone on 1/10/2025. I\ninterviewed AW separately by telephone on 1/17/2025.\nCA reported they are a very small agency, and AW is the\nsupervisor/licensing worker who was charged to complete the\nspecial evaluation on Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s foster\nhome. CA reported AW said she had completed the special\nevaluation and had responded to the department’s contact to her\nabout the status of that special evaluation. CA was initially not\nclear whether she had been included on emails from Department\nPerson to AW about concerns with the case and the status of the\nspecial evaluation, but she was able to locate the emails that\n2",
    "showed she had been. She provided a copy of the emails as\nindicated below.\nAgency Worker (AW): On 1/17/2025, I interviewed AW by\ntelephone. She reported she did not write up the special\nevaluation report until 1/14/2025. She said she had previously\nentered information and documents in CWLM, but she was not\nsure where the information went. She admitted she had reported\nto Department Person that she was waiting on the children service\nworker’s report, and other data in order to complete Listening\nEar’s special evaluation report. She reported the latter was before\nshe received clarification sometime in December 2024 that she\ndid not need the children service worker’s report to finish Listening\nEar’s special evaluation report.\nAW reported on 11/4/2024 she sent the Branch County\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) worker and\nsupervisor an email that she was working on the special\nevaluation. She did not recall a response from those DHHS\npersons to her email. She said Listening Ear was not certain as\nto how they were to act given that the foster care case was being\ntaken from them. She said DHHS reached out to her again on\n12/18/2024 asking for an update related to the special evaluation\nand she provided them an update and apprised them of the 45-\nday extension. She said she provided the DHHS worker, DHHS\nsupervisor, the foster parents, and the adoption worker a copy of\nthe special evaluation report on 1/17/2025. As for a copy of the\nreport to the Listening Ear worker, AW reported that person had\nbeen placed on suspension and later terminated in December\n2024 due to concerns reported by DHHS, that lead to the\ndepartment taking the cases back.\nDocument Review:\nCWLM Provider Record Review\nOn 1/2/2025 I reviewed the CWLM record for Foster Parent A and\nFoster Parent B. At that time a 10/16/2024 intake was seen\nrelated to four allegations pertaining to the foster home. There\nwas no initiation date entered, no social work contacts entered, or\ndocuments uploaded related to the intake and allegations\npertaining to the foster home. The records also showed a\nreevaluation report for Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s\nrenewal inspection signed/dated by AW and Chief Administrator\nfor 12/6/2024. This reevaluation report indicated a special\ninvestigation was initiated during the licensing period on\n10/14/2024 and that the special evaluation was currently on going.\n3",
    "My subsequent review of the foster parents’ CWLM record on\n1/17/2025 showed a special evaluation initiation letter dated\n10/16/2024 and a 11/30/2024 45-day letter to the foster parents\nindicating a need for an extension on the special evaluation due to\nthe agency waiting on receipt of a copy of the children service\nworker’s report. Both of these letters were created in CWLM by\nAW on 1/3/2025. The special evaluation report was listed as\ncreated in CWLM by AW on 1/14/2025. Chief Administrator\napproved the special evaluation report in CWLM on 1/15/2025.\nThe uploaded, special evaluation report was dated 1/15/2025.\nCA emails that showed a string of emails going back to 11/1/2024\nrelated to the department taking the children’s cases back, efforts\nneeded to complete a borrowed home agreement with the foster\nhome; as well as 12/3/2024 and 12/19/2024 emails from\nDepartment Person specifically related to questions about the\nfoster parents’ special evaluation, and its status, along with AW’s\nresponse to Department Person via email on 12/19/2024 denoting\nshe was currently working on the special evaluation narrative.\nThat the special evaluation was created on 10/16/2024 and an\nextension was requested on 11/30/2024.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed although the agency did not create or enter information\ninto CWLM timely, it initiated the special evaluation timely and\nrequested an extension timely when the evaluation was not\ncompleted within 45 days of the special evaluation’s 10/16/2025\ninitiation date.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327\nSection (5) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an agency\nDescription shall complete a written report that includes all the following\ninformation:\n(c) Dates and places of contact, names and person interviewed,\nand the names of the interviewees. If children are interviewed,\ntheir last names may not be included in the report.\nViolation Additional Findings of Noncompliance\nType\nAllegation The agency’s special evaluation report does not show verification\nthat the worker interviewed the youth placed in the home related\nto the allegations in the special evaluation. Additionally, the report\nlisted the foster youth’s full name.\n4",
    "Investigation Interviews:\nChief administrator & Agency Worker\nDuring my telephone contact with CA and AW on 1/3/2025 and\n1/17/2025 respectively, both acknowledged that AW completed\nthe special evaluation on Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s\nfoster home.\nAdditionally, AW acknowledged that during the special evaluation,\nshe conducted interviews of the foster parents with the children\nservices worker, but not Youth C who was/is placed in the foster\nhome. She reported the agency made the decision to not\ninterview Youth C due to concerns by the foster parents that the\nagency was causing trauma to Youth C. It was reported when\nYouth C saw the agency staff Youth C feared the agency was\nthere to remove him from the home. AW reported they decided\nthey would use the notes from the children service worker’s\ninterview of the youth.\nDocument review:\nI reviewed the agency’s special evaluation report for Foster Parent\nA and Foster Parent B dated 1/15/2025 which:\n• Did not show an interview with foster child, Youth C (age\n11) who resides in the foster home related to interviews for\nall three of the allegations that alleged a possible lack of\ncare related to the foster youth.\n• Showed the special evaluation report’s analysis section\nreferenced the children services worker’s interview of Youth\nC for two of the three allegations that related to allegations\nwith respect to the youth.\n• Contained Youth C’s full name.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed the agency included Youth C’s last name in the report.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12327\nSection (6) Within 15 days of the conclusion of the evaluation, an agency\nDescription shall complete a written report that includes all the following\ninformation:\n(b) Inform the foster parent, in writing that the foster parent has a\nright to have his or her written response included as an\nattachment to the report required by subrule (5) of this rule.\nViolation Additional Findings\nType\n5",

She reported she did not receive a letter or\nemail indication that she and Foster Parent B can attach a written\nrespond to the report. She forwarded me a copy of the email AW\nsend her showing the special evaluation was attached.\nDocument review:\nI reviewed Foster Parent A and Foster Parent B’s CWLM provider\nrecord which showed:\n• The special evaluation dated 1/15/2025.\n• A special evaluation checklist showing check offs that a\ncopy of the report was provided to the foster parents, with\nadvisement of their rights, but there was no proof this\ninformation was provided to the foster parents.\n• No letter, email or social work contact showing the foster\nparents were advised they can attach a written response to\nthe special evaluation report if they chose to do so.\nAn email from AW to Foster Parent A dated 1/17/2025 that\nindicated:\n“As requested, attached is the Special Evaluation report\nwhich was completed for your home. Your home was found\nto be in compliance with all licensing rules. If you have any\nquestions, please reach out and I am happy to answer\nthem.”\nNo advisement of a right to include a written response to\nthe special evaluation report.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed the evidence\nshowed the agency did not inform the foster parents of their write\nto include a written response.\nConclusion VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n6",
