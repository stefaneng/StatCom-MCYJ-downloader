    "III. INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4142 Health services; policies and procedures\nSection (1) An institution shall establish and follow written health service\nDescription policies and procedures addressing all of the following:\n(e) Dispensing medication.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A youth with multiple mental health diagnoses was not given a\ndose of medication as required. The youth was taken to the\nhospital to be examined.\nInvestigation INTERVIEWS:\nYouth A was interviewed via phone on 4/18/25. Youth A\nreported she takes medications in the morning and in the evening.\nYouth A reported she does not know how many medications she\ntakes and isn’t very familiar with the medications she takes. Youth\nA reported she has always taken medications in front of staff, and\nthey must be in front of a camera. Youth A reported she has never\nmissed her medications unless she is in the hospital, and she has\nnever been given too many medications to her knowledge. Youth\nA reported she has not had any concerns with how staff at the\nfacility dispense her medications.\nLicensee Designee (LD) was interviewed face to face at the\nfacility on 4/10/25. LD reported she did not have any further\ninformation about the allegations.\nChief Administrator (CA) was interviewed via phone on\n3/31/25 and face to face at the facility on 4/10/25. CA reported\nYouth A’s medications come pre-separated into a sealed\nmedication packet, and they receive a new medication pack each\nWednesday. CA reported Youth A has four packets of medications\nfor each day of the week. One packet of medications is provided\nto Youth A in the morning and three packets of medications are\nprovided to Youth A in the evening before bedtime. When Staff 3\ngave Youth A her morning medications on Friday 3/28/25, Staff 3\nidentified some of Youth A’s medications were missing (all for\nWednesday 3/26/25, one for Friday 3/28/25 evening, and two for\nSaturday 3/29/25 – one morning & one evening). In addition, two\nof the Thursday evening packets were still present despite Staff 1\nsigning off that Youth A received all her evening medications on\nThursday 3/27/25. CA reported she watched the camera footage\nfrom the office to try and determine what might have happened to\nthe medications, but she could not determine anything from the\nfootage. CA reported she watched Supervisor put the medications\naway in the staff office on Wednesday evening around 5:00pm,\n2",
    "Staff 2 get out Youth A’s medication packet for the Thursday\nmorning medication pass, Staff 1 get out the medication packet for\nthe Thursday evening medication pass, and Staff 3 get out the\nmedication packet for the Friday morning medication pass. CA\nreported no other staff touched the medications according to the\ncamera footage. CA reported since they didn’t know if Youth A\nwas provided with too many medications or if the medications\nwere missing for another reason, they wanted to err on the side of\ncaution and took her to the hospital to get medically cleared. CA\nreported the hospital couldn’t draw blood to identify if Youth A had\nan increased level of medications in her system, but Youth A’s\nvitals were taken at the facility as well at the hospital, which were\nboth fine. Youth A returned to the facility after she was medically\ncleared. CA reported Youth A had her routine bloodwork\ncompleted on 3/31/25 and there were no concerns noted. CA\nreported Youth A’s bloodwork always comes back “abnormal”, but\nthe doctor and pharmacy do not have any concerns with her\nresults.\nStaff 1 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/10/25.\nStaff 1 reported on the evening of Thursday, 3/27/25, she cleaned\nthe kitchen, and then at around 8:50 pm, she passed evening\nmedications to Youth A and Youth B. Staff 1 reported she\nprepared and passed Youth B’s medications first. Staff 1 reported\nshe went back into the staff office, took out Youth A’s medications,\nand made sure the medications on Youth A’s medication list\ncorresponded with the medication packet. Staff 1 reported she\nwent out to the living room where Youth A was sitting on the\ncouch, punched out the three evening packets of medication into\nYouth A’s hands, watched Youth A take them with water, and then\ndid a mouth check to ensure Youth A swallowed the medications.\nStaff 1 reported after she passed Youth A’s medications, she then\nsigned off that she passed Youth A’s medications. Staff 1 reported\nthe medication log includes a medication sheet with medications\nlisted separately in different boxes. The morning medications are\nhighlighted in yellow, and the evening medications are highlighted\nin blue. Staff 1 reported staff initial each row/column for the\ncorresponding medications and day they passed. Staff 1 reported\nshe feels she knows for sure she punched out the correct\nmedications for Youth A. Staff 1 described the three evening\nmedication packets Youth A takes in the evening (one packet has\nsmall pills, the second packet has one large pill, and the last\npacket is a lot of different types of pills). Staff 1 reported she\nknows for sure she passed the right medications to Youth A\nbecause the large pill in the second packet of the evening\nmedications fell on the floor when she punched it out for Youth A.\n3",
    "Staff 1 reported the pill went a little bit under the couch, so she\npicked up the pill off the floor and then gave it to Youth A to take.\nStaff 1 reported she couldn’t remember if any of the medications\nfrom Friday 3/28/25 or Saturday 3/29/25 were punched out when\nshe passed Thursday’s evening medications. Staff 1 could not\nexplain why the two packets of Youth A’s evening medications\nfrom 3/27/25 were still sealed and in the medication pack. Staff 1\nreported she is frustrated because she has been doing this for a\nlong time and cannot visually remember what Youth A’s\nmedication pack looked like when she put it back in the\nmedication safe in the staff office.\nStaff 2 was interviewed via phone on 4/11/25. Staff 2 reported\nhe passed medications to Youth A the morning of Thursday\n3/27/25 as he has been her 1:1 staff for a while now. Staff 2\nreported when he passed medications, he noticed some\nmedications were missing out of Youth A’s medication pack, but\nhe couldn’t remember what specifically was missing. Staff 2 could\nnot remember if Wednesday 3/26/25 medications were missing or\nnot. Staff 2 reported he could have taken the initiative to report the\nmissing medications. However, because Youth A is in and out of\nthe hospital so often, sometimes her medications are missed for\nthat reason, so Staff 2 didn’t necessarily see it as odd. Staff 2\nreported there needs to be a better process and procedure for\nmedication passing. Staff 2 reported the pre-sorted medication\npacks have been better, but it would still be helpful to have a more\nefficient process.\nStaff 3 was interviewed face to face at the facility on 4/10/25.\nStaff 3 reported she went to pass youth medications on the\nmorning of Friday, 3/28/25 and she noticed Youth A’s medication\npacket had medications missing for times that had not occurred\nyet on 3/28/25 and 3/29/25. Staff 3 reported she immediately\nstopped passing medications because she didn’t want to\novermedicate Youth A. Staff 3 reported she could not remember if\nany other staff passed medications prior to her that morning, but\nYouth A didn’t wake up until almost noon, so she knew Youth A\nhadn’t received her morning medications yet. Staff 3 reported as\nsoon as she saw the missing medications, she notified CA.\nSupervisor was interviewed face to face at the facility on\n4/10/25. Supervisor reported he picked up Youth A’s medications\nfrom the pharmacy on 3/26/25, brought the medications back to\nthe facility, labeled the pack with dates, and put them in the\nmedication cabinet. Supervisor reported he was present when\nStaff 1 passed Youth A’s medications to her in the evening of\n4",
    "3/27/25, but he didn’t see what medications Staff 1 punched out or\nwhat medications were passed. Supervisor reported he didn’t look\nat the medication pack until 3/28/25, when CA showed him the\npackage where there were missing medications from 3/28/25 and\n3/29/25, as well as medications still in the package from the\nevening of 3/27/25. Supervisor reported it was decided he and CA\nwould be the only two individuals responsible for passing\nmedications until another process could be figured out.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nVideo footage from the evening of 3/27/25 was reviewed. The\nvideo does not have audio. The video shows the living room of the\nfacility. Youth B is seated on a chaise lounge watching TV.\nSupervisor is sitting on the far end of a couch (away from Youth A)\nwatching TV. Youth A is sitting on another couch in the corner of\nthe room watching TV. Staff 1 walks into the living room and\nstands in front of Youth A. Staff 1 hands Youth A a water bottle\nand has a medication pack in her hand. Staff 1 looks at the\nmedication pack (no details of the medication pack can be seen\non the video). Staff 1 then moves over to the other side of Youth A\nwith her back facing the camera, which blocks the medication\npack from view of the camera. Staff 1 squats down in front of\nYouth A. Supervisor leaves the living room. Due to the camera\nangle, the video does not show the medication pack or what\nmedications Youth A takes. At one point, Staff 1 stands up with\nthe medication pack in her hand, moves something out of her way,\nsits on the couch opposite of Youth A and leans forward.\nHowever, the camera angle prevents the viewer from seeing what\nStaff 1 is doing. Staff 1 then stands up, takes a few steps, and\nstands in front of Youth A again with the medication pack in her\nhand. Supervisor re-enters the living room and sits in the same\nspot he was in prior. Staff 1 turns away from Youth A and begins\nwalking away.\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n• Incident Report dated 3/28/25 authored by CA states Staff\n3 notified CA medications appeared to be missing for future\ndays from Youth A’s bubble pack, and Thursday night’s\nmedications remained in the bubble pack. Due to the\nunknown of whether the medication was missing or\nadministered to Youth A, vitals were taken at the facility\n(which were normal), and Youth A was sent to an\nEmergency Room for medical clearance due to the anti-\npsychotic Clozaril prescribed to Youth A. Youth A’s blood\nlevels are checked weekly to monitor the identified anti-\npsychotic.\n5",
    "• Documentation dated 4/10/25 authored by CA explaining\nmedications errors states the following medications were\nmissing from Youth A’s medication packet as of the\nmorning of Friday 3/28/25:\no Friday 3/28/25 PM – 3.5 pills of Clozaril (350 mg)\no Saturday 3/29/25 AM – Iron Supplement (325 mg),\nMulti-Vitamin, Lithium (300 mg), Buspar (10 mg),\nMetformin (850 mg), and Levothyroxine Sodium\n(Colace).\no Saturday 3/29/25 PM - 3.5 pills of Clozaril (350 mg)\nIn addition, CA notes 2 out of 3 packets of Youth A’s\n3/27/25 PM medications were still sealed and present in\nYouth A’s medication pack despite all 3/27/25 PM\nmedications being signed for by Staff 1.\n• Picture still-shot of Youth A’s medication pack on the desk\nin the staff office on the evening of 3/27/25 does not clearly\nshow what medications are present and missing.\n• Picture (dated 3/28/25 after AM medication pass) of Youth\nA’s medication pack for 3/26/25-4/1/25 shows the following:\no Wednesday 3/26/25 AM med packet is present,\nwhich is accurate as the medication pack was new\nas of Wednesday late afternoon/early evening.\no Wednesday 3/26/25 PM meds (3 packets) are\nempty, and these medications were passed\nappropriately.\no Thursday 3/27/25 AM meds packet is empty, and\nthese medications were passed appropriately.\no Thursday 3/27/25 PM meds (1st packet) is empty,\nand 2 packets were present.

The missing\nmedications from the empty packet were\nunaccounted for.\no All medications for Sunday 3/30/25-Tuesday 4/1/25\nwere present.\n6",
    "• Picture (dated 4/10/25 during Consultant’s facility visit) of\nYouth A’s medication pack for 3/26/25-4/1/25 shows 2 of 3\nmedication packets for Thursday 3/27/25 PM were still\npresent and were never passed to Youth A despite being\nsigned off on by Staff 1.\n• Youth A’s Emergency Room discharge paperwork dated\n3/28/25 notes Youth A was at her baseline in no acute\ndistress. Youth A denied any intentional overdose, and\nreported she is at a facility where her medications are\nmonitored. There were no concerns noted.\n• Youth A’s bloodwork dated 3/31/25 does not have any\nconcerns.\n• Youth A’s Medication Administration Record from March\n2025 notes Staff 1 signed off on providing Youth A with all\nher PM medications on 3/27/25.\n• Medication Procedure and Guidelines Policy states\nmedications are in a locked cabinet that cannot be\naccessed by youth. Medications are administered to youths\non-site, individually, and are only to be administered by\nstaff. After medications are administered, a medication\ntracking chart is signed by the staff who administered the\nmedication. Medications not administered due to\nmedication refusal by youth, or lost/damaged by staff or\nyouth, are to be documented in an incident report and\nreported to the staff’s immediate supervisor. Staff complete\nrequired orientation and training prior to handling,\ndispensing, and administering medication. Staff need to\nobserve seven rights when passing medications (right\nindividual, right medication, right dose, right time, right\nroute, right method, right position). If medications are\nmissing, staff must notify the Chief Administrator. Staff\nmust document any medication error (incorrect medication\ngiven, no medication in container, no medication given –\noversight, etc.) by completing an incident report form.\n• Staff 1 does not have any disciplinary action in her\nemployee file.
