She reported Foster\nCare Worker (FCW) arrived at the facility at approximately 5pm for\na visit with Youth A. CCI YL stated she was present for the entire\nmeeting between FCW and Youth A. The meeting seemed to be\ngoing well initially. At one point FCW informed Youth A she would\nnot be taking her on an outing that day. Youth A became upset\nbecause she assumed they would be going on an outing. Youth A\ntold CCI YL to “let this bitch out”. CCI YL had been sitting down\nand got up to let FCW out because she could see Youth A was\nstarting to become agitated. Youth A was walking behind her and\nrepeated “let this bitch out”. FCW ask “this what” and Youth A\nrepeated “this bitch”. CCI YL stated FCW said something in\nresponse, but she couldn’t recall what she said. CCI YL let FCW\nout the first door and then the second door. When they\napproached the door where FCW would be exiting Youth A had\nCCI YL’s arm and was stating “let this bitch out” and FCW said\n“I’m not Vista Maria staff. I can hit you”. FCW and Youth A were\nbecoming closer and CCI YL was standing in the middle and\ntrying to keep them away from each other. Youth A had calmed\ndown slightly but FCW continued to be upset and stated, “let me\nget this bitch, let me get this bitch.”\nCCI YL stated Youth A and FCW began swinging at each other,\nbut she couldn’t recall who swung first. After the incident Youth A\nwasn’t upset about the physical altercation but seemed more\nupset about not being able to go on an outing.

    "she was being hit more since she was in the middle trying to\nseparate the two of them.\nYouth A was interviewed via video conference on February\n11, 2025. She stated FCW was her caseworker at the time of the\nincident on January 24, 2025, but is no longer her worker. She\nstated FCW came for an announced visit with her on January 24,\n2025. CCI YL was also present the entire time FCW was at the\nfacility with her. She stated during the visit with FCW they\ndiscussed the possibility of Youth A leaving Vista Maria. At one\npoint during the visit, Youth A stated she told FCW she was\nmaking everything bad and called her the “B” word. Youth A\nclarified she stated the full word. She said FCW asked her what\nshe said and Youth A repeated it. She stated toward the end of\nthe meeting neither she nor FCW were that upset. Once they\nexited the room where the visit took place and walked into a\ncommon area she was telling CCI YL to “let this bitch out, let this\nbitch out”. She stated FCW said “I’m not Vista Maria staff I can put\nmy hands on you”. FCW started to hit her and was calling her a\nbitch while swinging at her. Youth A stated she never lifted her\nhands toward FCW or made any attempt to hit her. Youth A stated\nshe didn’t have any marks or bruises as a result of the altercation.\nShe clarified FCW was swinging at her but never made contact\nwith her because CCI YL was in between them and she believes\nshe was hit.\nFoster Care worker (FCW) was interviewed via telephone on\nFebruary 11, 2025. She stated she conducted a face-to-face visit\nwith Youth A at Vista Maria on January 24, 2025. Due to Youth\nA’s previous behavior, there is supposed to be another 2 staff\npresent but on the day of her visit there was only 1 staff from Vista\nMaria present. She clarified Youth A has a history of physical\naggression toward staff and other youth. FCW stated she didn’t\nquestion why there was only 1 staff from Vista Maria present\ninstead of 2 because Youth A had not previously attempted to\nbecome physical towards her.\nThe meeting was held in a separate room off a common area.\nYouth A was sitting on a small, padded mat on the floor and there\nwas a chair in the room for FCW. FCW stated the meeting started\noff fairly well. Youth A told FCW that she would be moving to\nanother facility the following week. There was some discussion\nregarding the upcoming move and the expectations to follow the\nrules and keep her hands to herself. Youth A made a comment\nabout having her dad come up to the facility and beat everyone’s\n“ass”. FCW stated no one is trying to fight anyone and attempted\n3",
    "to redirect the conversation back to following the rules at the new\nfacility and then maybe she can have an outing. FCW stated at\nthat point Youth A started to become agitated and seemed like\nshe was going to stand up and told FCW to leave. FCW stated\nYouth A told CCI YL that she can go ahead and “let this bitch out”.\nFCW asked Youth A what she called her and she continued to\nrepeat you can go ahead and “let this bitch out”. FCW decided to\nleave. She stated she walked ahead, CCI YL was behind her and\nthen Youth A was last. FCW stated she had to wait for CCI YL to\nlet her out through the door. While they were walking out Youth A\nstruck FCW in the back of the head. FCW turned around and said,\n“I can’t believe you hit me in the fucking head”. FCW isn’t sure if\nCCI YL saw Youth A hit her. She thought CCI YL was still\nbetween them, but she didn’t recall seeing CCI YL when she\nturned around after being hit in the head. Youth A continued\ntoward her and FCW put her arm up to maintain separation and\ntold Youth A not to walk up on her. Once in the common area\nFCW stated she was questioning Youth A regarding why she was\nresponding like that when her intention was to steer her in the\nright direction. FCW stated she was upset after being struck and\nthought Youth A was going to try and fight her and responded by\nswinging at her. She stated she swung at her one time. She\nbelieved Youth A tried to swing at her again, but CCI YL was\nbetween them at that point. She doesn’t recall saying anything at\nthis point and she doesn’t recall Youth A saying anything.\nFCW stated she was surprised by the incident because Youth A\nhas never hit her before. She stated she has pushed her before.\nShe reported the previous incident to her supervisor and believed\nshe filled out an incident report. After the physical altercation, she\nreported to FC supervisor that Youth A hit her first. She stated she\nfeels she and Youth A both made a bad decision and her action\nwas because of a reaction.\nFC supervisor was interviewed via Teams on February 14,\n2025. She stated she is FCW’s supervisor. She clarified FCW was\nassigned to Youth A’s case since she came into care in November\n2023. She stated Youth A has a history of assaultive behavior\ntowards staff and other youth and there are currently juvenile\ncharges pending against her for assaulting residential staff.\nFC supervisor stated FCW called her after the visit on January 24,\n2025, and told her that Youth A had struck her in the back of the\nhead during her visit. She stated it occurred while she was walking\nout the door. FC supervisor advised her to file an incident report\nand to go to Concerta to be checked out. She said the\n4",
    "conversation was brief. FCW was upset and sounded as though\nshe was going to start crying but didn’t mention how she\nresponded or that she had struck Youth A.\nFC supervisor stated Vista Maria had previously requested 3:1\nstaffing for Youth A due to her assaultive behaviors. She stated\nduring a meeting this week the agency changed the request to\n5:1. She stated Vista was rotating staff every 45 minutes to an\nhour because Youth A’s behavior was so escalated but there was\n1 staff present during FCW’s visit. FCW conducts more visits with\nYouth A than required to try and assist. The week of the incident\nshe visited Youth A approximately 2-3 times. FC supervisor stated\nFCW went above and beyond to work with Youth A and maintain a\nconnection and she believed FCW was upset that Youth A struck\nher since she puts in so much effort to work with her.\nFC supervisor stated there was a previous incident where Youth A\nhad shoved FCW. She had advised FCW to file an incident report,\nbut FCW declined because she wasn’t injured and felt as though\nYouth A did not intend to inflict harm on her. FC supervisor stated\nshe has never had any concerns with FCW. She stated she\nwitnessed another client verbally berating FCW, and she\nmaintained her composure the entire time.\nVideo Reviewed:\n• Video footage of January 24, 2025 in a common area at\nVista Maria was reviewed on January 29, 2025.

At the conclusion of the visit,\nFCW walks out first followed by CCI YL and Youth A is the\nlast one to walk out. Youth A is seen with her hands at her\nside as she walks out of the visit room. They then walk\nthrough another room with a few benches and a TV. FCW\nwalks out first followed by CCI YL and then Youth A. Once\nin the common area FCW turns around and raises her\nelbow parallel to the floor with Youth A standing in front of\nher.
