    "the parent agency treatment plan with the parent or\nparents and foster parents. The agency must inform the\nparent or parents and foster parent that the information in\nthe parent-agency treatment plan and any other\ninformation about the child and the child’s family is\nconfidential.\nOne of twenty-nine treatment plans did not have a foster parent signature to indicate\nthe foster parent was included in development of the plan or received a copy of it.\nFOM 722-06B Family team meeting\nFTMs must occur within the required time frames as\noutlined in the following tables:\n• Updated Case Plan (USP) - within 30 calendar\ndays before the case plan due date.\n• Within 30 calendar days after the child’s 14th\nbirthday and every six months thereafter.\nTwo of eight foster care files did not meet FTM requirements.\nOne file did not have an FTM documented within 30 days prior to one updated\nservice plan.\nThe second file did not have an FTM documented within 30 days prior to three\nupdated service plans. The same file also did not have a semi-annual transition plan\ncompleted within 30 days of the youth turning 14.\nREPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n11/17/2022 RENEWAL, CAP approved 12/2/2022\nIV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nThe facility was offered technical assistance in the following area:\n• Volunteer qualifications- Rule 206 (4) requires CPS clearances to be\ncompleted prior to unsupervised contact with children. Clearances must be\navailable on-site for review by DCWL.\nV. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not request consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\n3",
    "There was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod. One special evaluation was completed by the agency on 4/17/23. The\nspecial evaluation determined the foster home was in violation of rules 9403 Foster\nParent Duties and 9404 Behavior Management. It was determined the foster parent\nengaging in rough horse play with a child who interpreted this play as unsafe, due\nto their history of trauma. In addition, the foster parent used talk of the Boogyman to\ninfluence the child's behavior. The agency recommended a 1st provisional license.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period.The CAP, approved 12/2/22, was a result of the 11/17/22 renewal\nevaluation. During that review, the agency had fourteen violations regarding\nservice plans, home visits, missing placement information, independent living\ndocumentation, borrowed beds, signatures on reports, family team meetings,\nmedical passports, medical exams, case contact entry, and action summaries.\nDuring the current review, only four violations were found. Two of which are repeat\nviolations. Overall, the agency has demonstrated significant improvement and\ncompliance with their 2022 CAP.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe Chief Administrator Assessment (CAA) indicated some barriers during the\nprevious year. One barrier was staffing difficulties. Specifically, that six foster care\nstaff left within a short time frame. In addition, two foster care supervisors were on\nextended leave of absence, which resulted in one supervisor resigning. The\nagency was not permitted to hire another supervisor at that time. Due to these\nvacancies, case reassignments occurred, which causes some inconsistencies in\ncase management. The CAA further reported their experienced, lead worker, has\nhad to carry a full caseload due to the vacancies. Resulting in the lead worker\nhaving less time to mentor new staff.\nThe CAA further reported the statewide placement crisis as an ongoing challenge,\nwith staff spending a significant amount of time, and making extraordinary efforts,\nto prevent youth staying in the office or in a shelter. The agency has utilized\nborrowed bed agreements of Temporary Placement Provider (TPP) homes from\nother counties as one resource. The agency reported they continue to recruit new\nfoster homes, but recruitment has been a slow process. Licensing staff have also\nstruggled with the statewide implementation of a new computer system, CWLM.\nSeveral help desk tickets have been processed due to needed data fixes and\nprocesses not functioning as expected, which has delayed completion of some\nlicensing activities.\nDespite these challenges, the CAA reported the agency has been successful in\nimplementation of the CAP and shown improvement in all areas. The CAA\nidentified increased supervisory oversight and protected time for staff as\nsuccessful strategies to maintain CAP compliance.\nFinancial Overview\nNo financial concerns were noted.\n4",
    "Staff Interviews\nTwo staff, one licensing worker and one foster care worker, were interviewed. The\nfoster care worker stated the agency was understaffed at times this year, which\nresulted in her briefly taking extra cases to help. The worker did not mind helping\nand felt supported. The foster care worker reported her supervisor is excellent\noverall. The worker did not have any concerns about the agency. However, she\ndid note there were some issues with timely case assignments. When cases are\nnot assigned quickly, the workers struggle to meet the five-day timeframe to\ncomplete certain tasks. The worker discussed this concern with her supervisor.\nOtherwise, the worker stated she was very happy with and enjoy her job.\nThe licensing worker reported several changes this year with the implementation\nof the CWLM computer system and new licensing rules. She reported this can be\nchallenging at times, but her supervisor has been helpful and supportive. The\nworker noted she appreciates her supervisor’s ability to provide assistance and\nalso accept feedback from staff. The worker stated that recruitment of new homes\ncontinues to be a challenge. However, they continue to partner with another\nagency for recruitment activities and utilize the foster parent portal that was rolled\nout earlier this year. The worker reported being satisfied with her job overall. One\narea that she believes could be improved is utilizing CWLM to create reminders\n(ticklers) for all of the licensing deadlines that have been established through\npolicy/procedure.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency continues to be located in the same office building as the 2022\nreview. The building has sufficient space for staff and clients. There is adequate\nlocked storage for confidential materials.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThe DCWL Analyst identified three safety concerns as follows:\nSafety Alert 1: A visit was completed at the relative caregiver's home on 8/31/23. It\nwas noted the electrical outlets did not have covers. The relative was caring for a\ntoddler.\nResolution: On 9/1/23 the agency completed a home visit and confirmed outlet\ncovers had been installed throughout the home. Photos were provided to DCWL for\nverification. Agency staff had a conversation with the relative about the importance\nof ensuring the outlet covers remain in place and redirecting the child if they attempt\nto touch them.\nSafety Alert 2: A visit was completed at the relative caregiver's home on 9/11/23. It\nwas noted the family did not have a flotation device for their pool. Door alarms by the\npool and smoke detectors throughout the house were missing. The relative reported\nthe agency provided smoke detectors and door alarms, but they were removed\nduring a recent remodel.\nResolution: The agency visited the home on 9/12/23 and verified the flotation\ndevice had been returned to the location by the pool, door alarms were provided by\n5",
    "the agency and installed, and smoke detectors were observed to be installed and\nworking. Photos were provided to DCWL for verification.\nSafety Alert 3: A visit was completed at the licensed foster home on 9/12/23. It was\nnoted the door leading to the hot tub did not have an alarm and the hot tub cover did\nnot have locking latches.\nResolution: On 9/13/23 the agency visited the home and provided door alarms.\nThe alarms were immediately installed, and photos provided to DCWL for\nverification. On 9/15/23 locking safety straps were installed into each side of the hot\ntub cover to prevent it from being opened. Photos were provided to DCWL for\nverification.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\n_ ___________October 20, 2023________________________\nHeather A Reilly Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 20, 2023\n_______________________________________\nRorie Dodge-Pifer Date\nArea Manager\n6"
