    "V. CONSULTATION\nThe facility did not require any consultation.\nVI. EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nMaltreatment in Care\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 5 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows:\nAll CAPs during the period of review were a result of violations found during special\ninvestigations.\n- SIR #2024C0000969SI (dated 1/10/24; CAP approved 1/22/24). The facility had\na violation for Rule 109(1)(c) Program Statement as a staff at the facility\ncompleted a safety check on a youth while in the shower, which was a violation\nof the facility’s Resident Safety Checks Policy. As a result, the staff member\nreceived corrective action. In addition, the safety checks policy and rights of\nrecipients policy were reviewed at a staff meeting. Resident safety checks\nprocedure was added to initial staff orientation as well as discussed monthly at\neach staff meeting for 6 months.\n- SIR #2024C0000996SI (dated 1/24/24; CAP approved 2/6/24). The facility had\na repeat violation for Rule 109(1)(c) Program Statement as the facility used a\ngurney for a youth when they did not have a policy or procedure for the use of a\ngurney. As a result, a policy was established stating a gurney/stretcher is not to\nbe used with the facility’s youth. It was reviewed at staff meetings monthly.\n- SIR #2024C0001157SI (dated 3/5/24; CAP approved 3/28/24). The facility had\na repeat violation for Rule 109(1)(c) Program Statement as a staff at the facility\nused inappropriate language and engaged in inappropriate conversation with a\nyouth. As a result, the staff member involved received corrective action and met\nwith the Chief Administrator to review the facility’s Code of Ethical Conduct &\nStandards as well as the Staff-Client Relationships Policy. In addition, the\npolicies were discussed with all staff at the next staff meeting.\n- SIR #2024SIC0001273 (dated 4/19/24; CAP approved 5/28/24). The facility had\nviolations for Rule 113(1)(i) Employee Records: Central Registry Clearances,\nRule 113(1)(e) Employee Records: References, and Rule 128(1)(a)(b) Initial\nand Ongoing Staff Training. The facility was found in non-compliance due to\nhaving hospital staff reporting and completing restraints for youth in the\nprogram, but the hospital staff did not meet the hiring requirements for licensing.\nAs a result, the facility updated clearances for hospital staff, completed a\n4",
    "variance for references for non-Lotus specific staff (approved by DCWL), and\nestablished a one-hour orientation for non-Lotus specific staff (approved in\nvariance by DCWL).\n- SIR #2024SIC0001379 (dated 6/20/24; CAP approved 8/23/24). The facility had\nviolations for Rule 158(1)(a)(ii) Intervention Standards and Prohibitions due to a\nstaff restraining a youth inappropriately as well as Rule 163(5) Incident\nReporting due to the facility not completing the incident report timely. As a\nresult, the restraint model was discussed & re-education was completed during\nteam meetings in July, a one-on-one training session on the restraint model was\ncompleted with the staff involved, and improved internal practices related to\nentering/approving restraint incident reports timely.\nFinancial Overview\nThe facility's budget and financial audit were reviewed, and there were no concerns\nwith the facility's financial status.\nPREA compliance (if applicable)\nNot Applicable\nChief Administrator Assessment\nChief Administrator (CA) reported continued staff education through 2-hour monthly\nstaff meetings as well as three separate 1 hour long virtual team meetings three\ntimes per month have been largely beneficial for the program. CA reported the\nchange in their restraint policy to eliminate the need to end restraint episodes after\n14 minutes 59 seconds (even if a youth was still escalated) has largely reduced the\nnumber of restraints the program has had. CA reported it has also been helpful to\nsplit youth amongst the different pods to reduce escalations due to peer conflicts or\naggression. CA reported they are seeing successful outcomes for youth in their\nprogram. CA reported they have a great team of staff who are committed and\ndedicated to youth success.\nStaff and Youth Interviews\nStaff reported initial and ongoing trainings are very helpful for their positions. They\nreported they have a very supportive environment, and supervisors, managers and\nstaff are amazing. They reported they are updated on policy and procedure\nchanges, and communication is excellent. There were no concerns noted during\nstaff interviews.\nYouth reported they feel safe at the facility. They reported they get enough food,\nbut don't always like the food provided. They reported they enjoy the sensory\nrooms, visits with family and outings with staff. They feel staff are very supportive\n5",
    "and really care about them. There were no concerns noted during interviews with\nyouth.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walkthrough of the facility occurred on 10/23/24 and there were no concerns\nnoted. Only two out of the four pods are currently being utilized for youth.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it is\nrecommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nNovember 8, 2024\nShannon (Shay) Mavis Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 8, 2024\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n6"
