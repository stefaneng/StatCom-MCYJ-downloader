    "ALLEGATION:\nOn 5/20/21, two staff members beat up youth after being angry about a late parent\nphone call. Youth had injuries on their knee, foot, neck, forehead, and eye.\nINVESTIGATION:\nThis complaint was received on 05/24/21 and investigated jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. The complaint alleged the following:\nYouth A (14) is currently residing at Camp Highfields. Youth A is not a temporary\nor permanent court ward. Staff 1 and another unknown male are staff members\nat the facility. On Thursday night, Youth A got to make his family phone call.\nYouth A is the last child to receive his phone call each time and it usually\nhappens late in the evening as all the other kids take their time before him. On\nThursday night however, instead of telling Youth A’s mother that it was already\ntoo late for the call, the staff went and got Youth A and allowed him to continue\nhis call for 10 minutes. The two staff in particular, Staff 1, and another male\nunknown, tend to provoke Youth A into reacting or fighting back against them.\nThese two staff got upset that Youth A had his call so late that night, so they beat\nhim up. Youth A sustained drag marks on his left knee, a cut to his right foot,\nfinger like bruise marks on his neck, a small skin rip on his forehead, and his left\neye was also swollen, though not enough for Youth A to still be able to see out of\nit. As the nursing staff do not work on the weekends, Youth A has still not\nreceived any medical attention for his injuries. Youth A did not go to the on-\ncampus school on Friday morning as his body was too sore and in pain. Youth\nA’s counselor spoke with his mother and reported only that Youth A had to be\nrestrained Thursday night. There is concern for the physical abuse by these two\nstaff against Youth A that resulted in serious injuries, as well as for the lack of\nmedical attention received.\nI interviewed Youth A at his current placement, on 05/25/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Youth A reviewed the incident by noting that it started with Supervisor 1\nquestioning the staff as to why Youth A was getting a phone call. This occurred\nabout 9:50pm, per Youth A. Youth A reported that Supervisor 1 came to the unit and\nstarted talking under his breath about Youth A. Youth A said that Supervisor 1\ngrabbed him and put him on the ground. Then Staff 1 came and hit Youth A’s head\non the ground. The staff then picked him up and took him to the kitchen. Youth A\ndescribed that he was held in the restraint position with one staff on each arm and\nbent forward. Once released Youth A said he sat in a chair and then went to his\nbedroom. Youth A said that Supervisor 1 was in the room and Youth A touched the\ndoor so Supervisor 1 “slammed me.” Youth A said that he was grabbed in a\nheadlock and his head was pushed to the ground. Youth A said he was lying on the\nfloor and Supervisor 1 kept pushing his head on the floor. This occurred inside the\nbedroom. Youth A said that Supervisor 1 and Staff 4 picked him up from the floor\nand took him to the kitchen where he sat by the sink. Youth A said his head was\nbleeding and his knees were scraped.\n4",
    "Youth A said he was restrained again, but in the kitchen and noted that he thought\nthis lasted for about 30 minutes. Youth A said that he “flopped” to the ground and the\nstaff were holding his arms and legs. Youth A said that Supervisor 1, Staff 1, Staff 3,\nand Staff 4 were all holding him in a face down position. Youth A said that he was\ntrying to get on his side during the restraint. Youth A said that Staff 4 was\nintentionally putting pressure on Youth A’s carpet burned knees to make it hurt.\nYouth A said the staff picked him up and he began pacing. Staff 1 picked Youth A up\nand slammed him in a bear hug manner. Youth A said everyone was screaming and\nstaff circled around him. Youth A said that Staff 3 told him to stay put and that Youth\nA could not leave the area. Youth A said he tried going under the kitchen table to get\nout but Supervisor 1 grabbed Youth A by the foot and pulled him back from under\nthe table. Youth A said that he went to his room and took down his bed and began\npunching it, so staff took his bed out. Youth A said he felt like staff were picking on\nhim.\nYouth A said that Supervisor 1 talked to him in his bedroom and Youth A told\nSupervisor 1 that he thinks Supervisor 1 hurt him on purpose. Youth A said\nSupervisor 1 said that he understood and was talking like he was on Youth A’s side.\nYouth A said that he tried to close his door but was not allowed so the staff took him\nto the kitchen again, where Youth A was restrained again. Youth A said that there\nwas a vent nearby and he scraped his foot on it. He said he was wearing shorts and\nno shirt or shoes. Youth A said that he thought Staff 4 was intentionally sweating on\nYouth A. Youth A said that he was held by the wall and then released and asked for\na chair but was told no. Youth A said that he sat in the kitchen for a long period and\nbegan getting “pissed” at the staff. He went back to his bedroom and Supervisor 1\nput a chair in the doorway. Youth A said nothing else happened after that.\nYouth A reported that his right arm was hurting while he was at Highfields, but was\nfrom prior to placement there. Youth A said that he did not see the nurse but was\ngiven alcohol and Band-Aids for the scrapes. Youth A said that when he went to the\nemergency room, he did not mention his arm hurting. Youth A said this was his first\nrestraint with the involved staff. Youth A reviewed the injuries he said he obtained\nduring this incident. Youth A said he got the scrapes/rug burn on his left forehead\nand upper cheek from when Supervisor 1 had him in a headlock and was pushing\nYouth A’s head on the floor in his bedroom. Youth A said that the mark was from the\ncarpet. Youth A said that he had three marks on the left side of his neck but did not\nknow how those got there. Youth A said that he had carpet burn on his knees that\ncame from the restraints. Youth A said that he had a cut on the bottom of his right\nfoot from the vent in the kitchen. Youth A said that he had marks on both shoulders\nbut was not sure how he got them, but reported they were from the restraints. Youth\nA said no other youth witnessed this incident as they were in bed.\nI spoke with the Chief Administrator (CA) on 05/25/21 at the facility jointly with the\nDHHS Specialist. The CA reported ongoing behavioral issues with Youth A that has\nresulted in two to three staff working with him to maintain safety as Youth A\n5",
    "continues to make threats and be destructive. The worker has decided to move\nYouth A to detention.\nI reviewed the video of this incident jointly with the DHHS Specialist, and with the\nassistance of the Manager. The video started about 22:32:16 and was a view from\nthe common area where Youth A was viewed. We changed from views of the\ncommon area and the kitchen to review this incident from the best camera vantage\npoint. Staffs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were also in the area. About 22:37:30 Youth A came out\nof his room and into the common area and was standing face to face with Supervisor\n1. Supervisor 1 went hands on with Youth A, but it could not be seen why he\nengaged from the camera angle. The pair fell to the floor with Youth A on top of\nSupervisor 1. Staff 4 grabbed Youth A’s legs, while Staff 1 held Youth A’s left arm\nand Staff 3 held Youth A’s right arm. Youth A was in a prone position. The Manager\nreferred to this as “emergency floor procedures” and said the staff are trained on it.\nStaff 2 was seen observing this restraint. About two minutes passed and the staff\nbegan releasing and assisted Youth A to stand. They escorted him to the kitchen.\nSupervisor 1 and Staff 1 continued to hold Youth A in a standing hold and had him\nbent over. Youth A appeared to struggle, and they all went to the floor about\n22:40:46. Youth A was seen in a prone position and did not appear to be struggling.\nHe was released about three minutes later and assisted up to stand. Staff held him\nand used the wall for support. About 22:49:18 the staff escorted Youth A to his\nbedroom. At the doorway to Youth A’s room there was some kind of struggle\nbetween Youth A and staff, but what occurred was not clearly observable. The staff\nand Youth A went in the bedroom and the interaction could not be seen. Staff 2 was\nseen at the doorway but not involved in the physical altercation.\nThe staff escorted Youth A back to the kitchen at about 22:53:19. As Youth A\npassed the kitchen camera, the marks on his forehead and cheek were visible. The\nstaff held youth as they backed up to the wall for support. Supervisor 1 was seen on\nhis phone during this time. About 22:54:59, Youth A struggled and went to the floor\nand was held in a prone position again. About 23:02:36, Youth A was released and\nassisted up from the floor. He was prone the entire time on the floor. Youth A sat by\nthe wall and the staff maintained distance.\nYouth A went back to his bedroom and staff were seen going in and out of the\nbedroom and huddling around his doorway. Around 23:20:06, staff again escorted\nYouth A to the kitchen. Youth A sat on the counter on his own until Youth A got up\nand threw a speaker. Youth A was restrained again but kneeling on his knees and\nthen sat down this time. The staff released Youth A and continued to monitor him in\nthe kitchen. About 00:50:40 Youth A was observed getting agitated and then tried to\ngo under the kitchen table. Supervisor 1 pulled Youth A back by the leg and the staff\nrestrained Youth A again and in a prone position. Staff 2 was seen observing. About\n00:54:50 Youth A was released, and he got up on his own. Youth A walked to his\nbedroom and the staff remained by the door. About 01:10:40, the staff removed\nmore items from Youth A’s bedroom and then about a minute later there was a\nscuffle and Youth A was escorted back to the kitchen. Youth A was released, but\n6",
    "about 01:24:39 the staff went hands on again with no apparent threat of harm. Youth\nA sat down while the staff held his arms. The staff then picked him up to stand and\ntried to escort Youth A, but Youth A struggled and lifted his legs up off the floor. Staff\ncontinued to walk while lifting/carrying Youth A. The staff carried Youth A to the\ncommon area and sat him on the floor. About 01:25:55, Supervisor 1, Staff 1 and\nStaff 4 then picked up Youth A and carried him to his bedroom. They set his feet on\nthe floor, so he walked into his room.\nI interviewed Supervisor 1 at the facility, on 05/25/21, jointly with the DHHS\nSpecialist. Supervisor 1 recounted the incident, noting that Youth A had been angry\nafter a phone call with his mother. Supervisor 1 said he tried to talk to Youth A, but\nYouth A was not responsive and became increasingly verbally aggressive.\nSupervisor 1 added that Youth A had previously been physically aggressive with\nstaff as well. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A approached, and shoulder bumped\nSupervisor 1, so Supervisor 1 tried to put Youth A in a side hold, but Youth A\nstruggled and they went to the floor. The other staff assisted in holding Youth A in an\nEmergency Floor Procedure. Supervisor 1 said that no restraints are designed to\nhappen on the floor, but they end up there sometimes. Then they helped Youth A up\nto his feet and escorted him to his bedroom, where Youth A reportedly swung on\nSupervisor 1. Supervisor 1 said he went in Youth A’s bedroom to get him in a Team\nControl hold but ended up on the floor. Staff 1 and Staff 4 assisted and possibly Staff\n3, per Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 said that Youth A was struggling, biting, and\nspitting during this restraint. The staff then got Youth A up and escorted him to the\nkitchen because it was late and the other kids were asleep. Supervisor 1 said they\ncontinued to try and deescalate Youth A, released him, and backed up to a safe\ndistance.\nYouth A then went to his room and they allowed him some time to change with the\ndoor closed, but when Youth A would not come out or open his door, Supervisor 1\nsaid the staff went in and had to remove furniture as Youth A was throwing things\nand being destructive. Supervisor 1 said at one point Youth A grabbed a pen and\nthreatened to stab staff. Supervisor 1 said that he thinks Youth A’s rug burn injuries\ncame from the restraint in the bedroom because “things got rough due to\nresistance.” Supervisor 1 was not sure how the injuries occurred but noted that\nYouth A was rubbing his face on the floor while struggling against the staff. When\nthey came out of the kitchen was when Supervisor 1 noticed the marks. Supervisor 1\nsaid that the marks really bothered Youth A and “I don’t blame him.” Supervisor 1\nsaid that he offered to help get Youth A cleaned up, but Youth A was resistant.\nSupervisor 1 said that toward the end of this long incident, Youth A finally allowed\nSupervisor 1 to help get his head cleaned up.\nSupervisor 1 noted scratches on Youth A’s neck also, that he did not know how they\noccurred. Supervisor 1 said that the cut on Youth A’s foot came from Youth A\npushing against the wall in the kitchen and he scratched it on the vent. Supervisor 1\nsaid he is current on his restraint training and has not had any disciplinary action in\nthe last year. Supervisor 1 reported that they were not trying to take Youth A to a\n7",
    "prone restraint and got him up as soon as safely possible. Per Supervisor 1, the staff\ndo monitor the youth during restraints. Supervisor 1 said that picking up a youth\nduring an escort is not a taught procedure under the facility model. Supervisor 1 said\nthey decided to pick him up to get him back to his bedroom and then were able to\nleave him alone. Supervisor 1 also acknowledged pulling Youth A by his leg out from\nunder the table and said he had “no excuse” for doing that. Supervisor 1 just wanted\nto stop Youth A from trying to escape.\nI interviewed Staff 1 on 05/25/21, at the facility, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 1 reviewed the incident with similar details as viewed during the video review.\nStaff 1 said that this situation began after he allowed Youth A to make an after-hours\nphone call to his family. Staff 1 said he allowed this due to Youth A having a recent\ndeath in his family, but Supervisor 1 questioned Staff 1 on why he was allowing after\nhours calls. Staff 1 said that when he explained this to Youth A, Youth A took\noffense and began escalating and asked to speak to Supervisor 1. When Supervisor\n1 came to the house Youth A got even more agitated. Staff 1 said that the staff tried\nto support Youth A, but he continued to escalate and was not responsive. Staff 1\nsaid that the first restraint started because Youth A pushed through and maybe tried\nto hit Supervisor 1, but Staff 1 was not sure. Staff 1 said he thinks Youth A was\nlooking to fight Supervisor 1 the whole time. Staff 1 said that Youth A would\nescalate, and they would put him in a Team Control. Youth A would deescalate and\nthen begin testing the staff and they would have to do it again. Staff 1 said that this\nwent on until about 3:00am. Staff 1 said that when Youth A dropped his weight\nduring the last escort to his bedroom, the staff did lift/carry Youth A. Staff 1\nacknowledged that this is not an approved technique, but noted that they were trying\nto avoid another restraint. When asked why Youth A was held prone in every\nrestraint, Staff 1 said that they get the youth up when it is safe to do so. They do not\nintentionally take youth to the floor or have them in a prone position, but do if the\nyouth drops or momentum takes them there. Staff 1 also reported being in the\nbedroom for the restraint when Youth A got the rug burn on his face. Staff 1 denied\nseeing marks on Youth A’s neck or seeing any staff put Youth A in a headlock. Staff\n1 was aware that Youth A cut his foot in the kitchen on the vent during a restraint.\nI interviewed Staff 2 at the facility, on 05/25/21, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 2 said that she saw just about the entire incident, noting that Youth A calmed\ndown and talked with Supervisor 1 before she left around 2:15am. Staff 2 reviewed\nthe incident and confirmed Youth A initially escalated over the phone call and\nblamed Supervisor 1. Staff 2 said that Youth A began threatening Supervisor 1.\nWhen Supervisor 1 came to the house, Staff 2 said that the two were going back\nand forth and Youth A swung at Supervisor 1, which lead to a restraint. Staff 1\nrecalled the staff escorting Youth A back to his bedroom where Youth A swung and\nhit Supervisor 1 and was subsequently restrained again on the floor. Staff 1 said that\nthe staff and Youth A were “crammed” in the area where the restraint occurred and\nthat the staff tried to move out from the corner. Staff 1 said that she thinks that Youth\nA rubbed his head on the floor during this restraint, but noted that she did not see or\nthink the staff rubbed Youth A’s head on the floor on purpose. Staff 1 said that she\n8",
    "offered to help Youth A clean his face up that night, but he would not let her. Youth A\nonly let her wipe his face, but not clean the scrape. He did allow her to help the next\nday. Staff 2 did not see any injury to Youth A’s foot. Staff 2 said that the next day\nYouth A showed her some scrapes/ carpet burn on his knees. Staff 2 denied\nwitnessing any staff use headlocks, put hands on Youth A’s neck, use excessive\nforce or intentionally hurt Youth A during any of the restraints. Staff 2 said that she\ndid not see staff carry Youth A or pick him up during a transport. Staff 2 said that she\ndid not feel staff instigated or picked on Youth A, but Staff 2 said that she thinks\nYouth A took it that way. Staff 2 said she observed the restraints to make sure Youth\nA was ok and that staff held appropriately, even when prone, until it was safe to\nmove him.\nI interviewed Staff 3 on 05/25/21, at the facility, jointly with the DHHS Specialist.\nStaff 3 reviewed the incident noting the multiple restraints. Staff 3 said that he\nresponded to an emergency call and noted that the restraint was already occurring\nwhen he arrived, but Staff 3 switched out with one of the staff. He could not recall\nwho. Staff 3 said that Youth A had become escalated several times and was\nphysically managed. Staff 3 said that Staff 1 left around midnight when Youth A was\nstill escalated but staff were giving him space. Regarding injuries, Staff 3 said that\nYouth A had carpet burn on his face. Staff 3 said that he did not see it happen. Staff\n3 said that Youth A complained of pressure on his arm, so Staff 1 adjusted his hold.\nStaff 3 said that he and the other staff tried de-escalation strategies and put on\nmusic and let Youth A go to his room, but nothing worked. Staff 3 said that they hold\nyouth until it is safe to move them, even if they are prone. Staff 3 said that he did not\nobserve any staff using a choke hold or putting their hands on Youth A’s neck.\nI interviewed Youth A’s worker via phone on 06/07/21. The worker reported being\naware of this incident and expressed no concerns. The worker did not feel the staff\nat the facility have acted inappropriately with Youth A, noting that Youth A\nchallenges authority. He reported that the facility keeps him up to date on issues and\nconcerns with regard to Youth A.\nI interviewed Staff 4 via phone jointly with the DHHS Specialist on 06/10/21. Staff 4\nrecalled the incident and provided a recount that was very similar to those provided\nby other staff. Staff 4 said Youth A was restrained in Youth A’s bedroom, in the\ncommon area, and multiple times in the kitchen and noted he participated in most of\nthem. Staff 4 said that he did not participate in the restraint that occurred in the\nbedroom but was present for it. Staff 4 said that the bedroom restraint occurred\nbecause Youth A assaulted Supervisor 1. Staff 4 said that the staff initiated a Team\nControl position and it went to the floor. Staff 4 said when on the floor it is an\nEmergency Floor Procedure. Staff 4 said that the injuries to Youth A’s face occurred\nduring the bedroom restraint when he saw Youth A struggling against the staff and\nrubbing his own head on the floor in the process. Staff 4 said that the prone\nrestraints are provided for in the restraint model, but the staff try to get the youth up\nas soon as safely possible. During the restraints with Youth A, Staff 4 said that they\nwould attempt to get Youth A up, but Youth A was threatening, struggling, and\n9",
    "clenching, which made it unsafe. Staff 4 denied any memory of carrying Youth A,\nonly escorting him.\nI interviewed the complainant, on 06/10/21, via phone. The allegations were\nreviewed with the complainant. The complainant added that they know other friends\nand family who were placed at the facility years ago and reported these kinds of\nrestraints happened then also. The complainant was concerned about the injuries to\nYouth A and that she was not notified when the facility advised her of the restraint.\nThe complainant also reported that Youth A said that the staff antagonize the youth\nto get the youth to act out. The complainant also expressed concern that a nurse did\nnot evaluate Youth A after the incident.\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation is as follows:\n Employee disciplinary action and performance evaluations were reviewed for\nthe involved staff. Outside of minor attendance or unrelated issues the\nfollowing were observed: Supervisor 1 received a written reprimand, in\n08.2019, for not calling for assistance in an escalating situation with a youth\nuntil after physical management had begun, and not accurately and fully\nexplaining the incident on the incident report. Supervisor 1 received a written\nreprimand, in 05.2019, for not calling for assistance in an escalating situation\nwith a youth until after physical management had begun, using unapproved\nphysical management technique, and not accurately and fully explaining the\nincident on the incident report. Staff 3 received a Performance Feedback\nmemo, in 05.2017, related to active supervision.\n Behavior Management Philosophy and Procedures: The policy says that\nphysical management is not to be used for behavior management, but only if\nthere is an imminent threat of danger to an individual or significant and\ndangerous property damage. ‘Emergency floor procedures are no longer\npermitted based on the new emergency rules provided by the state.’ The\npolicy notes that if a restraint goes to the floor the staff are to do one of the\nfollowing, 1. Disengage, 2. Help the youth to their knees or to stand without\nuse of force, or 3. If the youth struggles while in an escort or hold, the staff\ncan use an approved hold that allows the youth to be seated.\n Critical Incident Procedures: Protocol to respond to critical incidents: ‘…it is\nexpected that staff members file factual, timely, and complete incident\nreports.’\n Incident Report, dated 05/20/21, and authored by Staff 2. Report noted that\nSupervisor 1 was on duty. The report outlined that Youth A became upset\nwhen Supervisor 1 directed the staff that youth are not to make phone calls\nafter 10:00pm. Youth A became aggressive and required multiple restraints.\nThe rug burn on Youth A’s face was documented and it noted that he\ndeclined any further assistance from staff. Supervisor 1 signed off on the\nreport as did the Manager.\n Emergency Department Record, dated 05/22/21. The report noted two\nsuperficial forehead abrasions noted, scrape on foot and scraped left knee.\n10",
    "No other signs of serious secondary injury. Treat abrasions with topical\nantibiotic.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n(b) Experience to perform the duties of the position\nassigned.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with this rule. There is no supporting\nevidence that Supervisor 1 or other staff beat up Youth A. Youth\nA was restrained multiple times and did sustain some superficial\ninjuries, which were assessed as such with no other medical\nconcerns noted by the treating physician, but there was no\nevidence to support the allegation of staff assaulting Youth A.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nALLEGATION:\nYouth did not receive medical attention and did not attend school on 5/21/21 due to\nthe pain.\nINVESTIGATION:\nYouth A was observed with several marks on his body. This included\nabrasions/carpet burns on his forehead and cheek, a small cut on his foot, red marks\non his neck, and carpet burn/scratches on his knees. Most notable was the carpet\nburn on his face, which was scabbed when seen in person on 05/25/21. Youth A\nsaid that staff gave him items to clean his injuries and Band-Aids as well. He further\nreported going to the hospital for an evaluation of his injuries. Staff also reported\noffering to assist Youth A in cleaning up his abrasions and providing him appropriate\ncleaning items and Band-Aids as well.\nThe facility policy states that if an injury occurs that the Director will notify licensing.\nThis occurred on 05/24/21 when the Director contacted the assigned DCWL\nConsultant about this incident and Youth A having been moved to detention.\n11",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nRule 400.4142 Health services: policies and procedures.\n(1) An institution shall establish and follow written health\nservices policies and procedures addressing all of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Routine and emergency medical, and dental, and\nbehavioral health care.\nANALYSIS: The facility is compliant with the rule as the injuries observed to\nYouth A appeared to be, and were assessed to be, superficial\nand not in need of immediate professional medical care. Staff\ndid offer basic first aid. The facility did have the youth medically\nevaluated; however, it was two days later and only after the\nDHHS Specialist requested it.\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:\nIt is highly recommended that the facility adds to their policy that\nall observed/reported injuries, even minor, will be professionally\nevaluated at the facility by medical personnel, or as soon as it is\nsafe to transport the youth, if they are sustained during a\nrestraint.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe staff did not follow the physical management policy.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, the staff were viewed on camera review, to\nhave restrained Youth A multiple times over a few hours. Not all of the incidents of\nrestraint were found to have a clear observation of an imminent risk of harm, and\nthey were done in a prohibited (prone) position. The facility policy says that physical\nmanagement is not to be used for behavior management, but only if there is an\nimminent threat of danger to an individual or significant and dangerous property\ndamage. This was not always observed in the video review. Additionally, the staff did\nnot disengage, or appear to make attempts to quickly move Youth A to a supine\nposition, or to stand him up at the earliest opportunity. The facility policy notes that,\n‘Emergency floor procedures are no longer permitted based on the new emergency\nrules provided by the state.’ The staff did not adhere to this. Finally, the staff were\nobserved to use other techniques that are not approved (carrying Youth A during the\nescort, pulling Youth A by the leg from under the table) in the facility’s restraint\nmodel, and this was acknowledged by staff.\n12",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nRule 1 Prohibition of Prone Restraint; Procedures Involving Other\nRestraints in Child Caring Institutions\n(1) A child caring institution (CCI) must establish and follow\nwritten policies and procedures regarding restraint. These\npolicies and procedures shall be available to all residents,\ntheir families, and referring agencies.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule as they did not follow their\npolicies and procedures related to physical management.\nCONCLUSION: REPEAT VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n2021C0214007, 03/11/21 and CAP, 03/15/21 (cited for not\nfollowing restraint policies but under Rule 1(2).\n2019C0212028, 08/14/19 and CAP, 08/19/19 (cited under R\n159(1))\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\nThe facility did not accurately report the events of this incident on the incident report.\nINVESTIGATION:\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was found that the Incident Report,\nsubmitted by Supervisor 1, was not an accurate reflection of the incident as it\nomitted the staff holding Youth A in a prone position multiple times, lifting/carrying\nYouth A, and pulling Youth A by his leg from under the kitchen table.\n13",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nRule 2 The written policy must include all of the following:\n(c) Procedures for recording restraints as an incident\nreport. The incident report must include the reason for the\nrestraint, the type of restraint used and its duration, names\nof all staff involved with the restraint and their roles and a\ndescription of all less restrictive interventions utilized prior\nto the initiation of the restraint.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule, as the incident report was a\nbrief summary of the hours long incident but did not identify the\nstaff holding Youth A in a prone position multiple times,\nlifting/carrying Youth A, or pulling Youth A by his leg from under\nthe kitchen table. Supervisor 1 signed off on the incident report,\nwhich was authored by Staff 2 who observed most of the\nincident, and was also reviewed by the Manager, who had also\nreviewed the video. The facility’s policy calls for staff to file\nfactual, timely, and complete incident reports.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violations.\nJune 28, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJuly 1, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n14"
