EVALUATION OF PERIOD UNDER REVIEW\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this licensing\nperiod.\n7",
    "There was one incident of substantiated corporal punishment during this licensing\nperiod.\nThis incident related to a foster home complaint where it was alleged the foster\nparent pushed her foster son in the chest. During the special evaluation the foster\nparent admitted to an incident where her subsititute caregiver hit the foster child’s\nhand after the child grabbed the substitute caregiver’s arm. The subsititute\ncaregiver corroborated the foster parent’s statement. The foster home was found in\nviolation of the foster home behavior management rule and supervison rule for\nusing a substitute caregiver who had not been approved by the agency. A\ncorrective action plan was developed with the foster parent around not using\ncorporal punishment, and only using an approved subsitiute care provider.\nThe agency adhered to departmental standards and timeframes related to this\nspecial evaluation. The agency’s actions appeared appropriate related to this\nincident.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency submitted one acceptable corrective action plan(CAP) during this\nlicensing period. This corrective action plan related to the agency’s 2023 Renewal\ninspection. The agency received 13 citations in 2023 and 17 this year. Of the 17\nrule violations received this year, two are repeat rule violations from 2023. The\nagency implemented its corrective action plan and made progress with it as\ndemonstrated by the low number of repeat citations, and the low number of\nindividual cases cited per rule. The latter being just one case for all the citations,\nexcept two.\nThe agency reported its efforts to totally complete its corrective action plan and to\nmaintain ongoing rule compliance was hampered by staffing issues. They reported\nexperiencing a number of staff departures and delays in hiring and maintaining\nworkers.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe agency submitted a chief administrator's report dated 10/14/2024.\nThe administrator reported the main systematic barriers that continues to impact\nrule/policy compliance has been the retention rate of foster care staff, as noted\nprior. Additionally, the mandated child welfare institute training for new staff which\nkeeps these staff away from the office, does not allow agency to fully use them\nuntil the completion of the training, and these staff appearing to not be adequately\nprepared after nine weeks of training. The administrator also reported\nMISACWIS, as well as CWLM as barriers to rule/policy compliance. The former\nsystem due to its inaccurately displaying some standards, such as worker /parent\nvisits. The latter CWLM system due to the many fixes the system has made and\nthe high number of help desk that resulted which caused licensing reports to be\ndelayed or late.\n8",
    "Notwithstanding the challenges the agency reported, they indicated continuing all\nefforts to hire new staff, and to gain and increase compliance. They reported the\ncorrective action had a positive impact on the agency in that it caused a greater\nfocus on various areas, such as special evaluations, and for it to examine where\ntraining needs exist.\nFinancial Overview\nThe agency submitted a copy of it 2024 annual budget and 9/30/2023 independent\nfinancial audit. A review of this information did not show concerns.\nStaff Interviews\nIn addition to discussion with the chief administrator/adoption director, the licensee\ndesignee, executive director of foster care & licensing, director of foster care,\nlicensing director, and two foster supervisors, I interviewed a licensing worker, two\nfoster care workers, adoption worker, and one foster supervisor.\nThe area of strengths reported by these staff related to there being good agency\ncommunication; reminders to workers of due dates by supervisors, co-workers and\nsupervisory support; the agency’s efforts to educate its staff; its review of its CAP\nwith staff; and conducting case file reviews. Areas of growth reported related to\nneeding there to be less policing of works, more timely communication related to\nfinancial/administrative changes, and improved communication between child\nwelfare and other agency components like residential, therapeutic services, and\nadoption.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nA walk through of the agency's office site did not reveal any concerns or safety\nissues. The agency has sufficient space and equipment for the staff; and files are\nsecurely stored physically and electronically.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nThere were no safety alerts.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nNovember 10, 2024\n________________________________________\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\n9",
