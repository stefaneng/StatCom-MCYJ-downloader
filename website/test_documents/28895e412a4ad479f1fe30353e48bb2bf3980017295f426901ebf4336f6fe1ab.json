    "Rule Code & CCI Rule 400.4124 Communication.\nSection (1) An institution shall have and follow a written policy regarding\nDescription communication that ensures that a child is able to communicate\nwith family and friends in a manner appropriate to the child’s\nfunctioning and consistent with the child’s treatment plan and\nsecurity level.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth was placed at the facility between 4/5/2022 - 10/25/2023. It\nwas reported that during this time, youth would have phone\ncontact with their adult brother who would make inappropriate\nsexual comments and threats of sexual assault. When the facility\nfound out, they stopped the contact. Youth did not have any\naccess to a phone to contact her brother.\nInvestigation Interview:\nComplainant was interviewed via telephone on November 29,\n2023, and reported they had no further information.\nYouth A was interviewed by Carehouse Children’s\nAssessment Center on November 28, 2023. Youth A frequently\ntalked with her head down making her difficult to understand and\nshe mumbled frequently. Youth A also at times appeared hesitant\nto answer questions. Youth A reported she had ongoing contact\nwith her brother, and he talked to her sexually stating he would\n“eat me out”, rape her again, and get her pregnant. Youth A\nreported staff at Bay Pines heard him say this and he threatened\nto beat her up for telling the staff about it. Youth A reported he\nthreatened to hurt her when she gets out and he will kill her\nmother when she is adopted. Youth A reported when she was at\nBay Pines Center, she would use Therapist’s work iPhone and a\nregular phone to Facetime, text, and talk to her bother. Youth A\nreported she got into trouble with Bay Pines staff for showing her\nbrother her body in the mirror and was told to hang up the phone.\nYouth A said her brother changed in front of her on facetime,\nwould show her his guns, watches, and said she should go out\nwith one of his friends. Youth A reported she was on the pod in\nBay Pines when this happened, and she reported it to Therapist\nand her brother was taken off her contact list. Youth A denied\nhaving visits with him while at Bay Pines Center.\nTherapist was interviewed via telephone on December 26,\n2023. Therapist said Youth A was approved to have phone\ncontact with her brother when she arrived at Bay Pines Center.\nTherapist said majority of these phone calls were supervised by\nher and only a few calls were on the pod supervised by a staff\nmember. Therapist said Youth A called her brother about once per\n2",
    "week until August 2023, when he was removed from her phone\nlist. Therapist said the conversations she supervised between\nYouth A and her brother were always appropriate and she never\nhad to end any calls early. Therapist said Youth A’s brother would\nalways redirect any negative conversation, encourage Youth A to\ndo positive things and work her treatment program. Therapist said\nthere was one conversation when Youth A told her brother he was\n“acting rude” and he said “well then don’t call me anymore” which\nYouth A interpreted as her brother did not want to talk to her\nanymore and Therapist had to repeat what was said to help Youth\nA understand that was not what he meant or was saying.\nTherapist said Youth A would often hear things the way she\nwanted to or would interrupt things incorrectly. Therapist said\nYouth A reported to her that during a phone call that was\nfacilitated on the unit by staff, she said something to her brother\nabout an article of clothing and he showed her his boxer band that\nwas flannel. Therapist said this statement by Youth A then\nmorphed into Youth A disclosing her brother showed a body part\nto her, then changed to her brother asking for sex. Therapist said\ndue to the concern for what was actually said and the phone calls\nto Youth A’s brother becoming more problematic for Youth A than\npositive it was decided to remove him from her call list. Therapist\nsaid she had a phone conversation with Foster Care Worker who\nagreed to suspend the contact with Youth A’s brother for the time.\nGroup Leader was interviewed via telephone on December\n27, 2023. Group Leader said Youth A was on his unit and he\nworked on her case. Group Leader said Youth A’s brother was on\nher contact list until about August 2023. Group Leader said\noriginally Youth A was only allowed to have phone contact with\nher brother in a “therapeutic setting” but eventually she was\nallowed to have contact supervised by staff on the unit. Group\nLeader said he supervised one call between Youth A and her\nbrother, and her brother was very encouraging to Youth A and told\nher to make good choices and do well in the program so she could\nmove onto another placement. Group Leader said Youth A never\ndisclosed any concerns or inappropriate conversations that took\nplace between her and her brother. Group Leader said Youth A\nbegan to make up scenarios after some of her calls which seems\nto lead to them doing more harm than good for Youth A. Group\nLeader said after some of the calls creating many behavioral and\nemotional issues for Youth A the team decided to remove Youth\nA’s brother from her call list. Group Leader said all calls are\nlogged on a contact list and staff are trained to end calls if they are\nnot positive for the youth.\n3",
    "Foster Care Worker was interviewed via telephone on\nJanuary 2, 2024. Foster Care Worker reported she has been\nYouth A’s caseworker for over a year however was not at the time\nof her placement at Bay Pines Center. Foster Care Worker said\nwhen she took over the case Youth A was having approved phone\ncontact with her brother. Foster Care Worker said she had no\nconcerns about the phone contact between Youth A and her\nbrother until she was informed that Youth A reported to a Bay\nPines Center staff her brother was making inappropriate\nstatements during phone conversations. Foster Care Worker said\nshe talked to Therapist and Group Leader who stated they\nsuspended all contact between Youth A and her brother due to\nYouth A’s report, and Foster Care Worker said she agreed that\nthe contact needed to be stopped. Foster Care Worker said Youth\nA never told her about the inappropriate conversations. Foster\nCare Worker said she had no concerns about the way in which\nBay Pines Center was handling Youth A’s phone contact with her\nbrother.\nDocuments Reviewed:\n• Youth A’s contact list dated September 15, 2023. Youth\nA’s contact list did not have her brother listed as of this\ndate. Therapist reported this is a fluid document that\nchanges each time a change is made by her or the youth’s\nfoster care worker.\n• A review of social work contacts in MiSACWIS was\ncompleted for May 15, 2023, until August 4, 2023. Youth A\ncontacted her brother on 5/15/2023, 5/21/2023, 5/27/2023,\n5/28/2023, 6/1/2023, 6/28/2023, 7/1/2023, 7/5/2023,\n8/4/2023.\n• A social work contact in MiSACWIS dated August 4, 2023,\nindicated Youth A’s disclosures of different versions of her\nphone call with her brother that was potentially\ninappropriate and therefore Therapist and Foster Care\nworker agreed to suspend the phone contact with Youth\nA’s brother.\n• Juvenile Justice Residential Manual (JRM) Youth\nCommunication and Family Time policy was reviewed. The\npolicy outlines the expectations for youth to have a contact\nlist and the ability to have contact with those indicated on\nthe list in the manner that is approved.\nAnalysis The facility is found in compliance with Communication. Youth A\nhad an approved contact list and was allowed calls with her\nbrother, the facility suspended the calls once they became\ndetrimental to Youth A and Foster Care worker approved.\n4",
