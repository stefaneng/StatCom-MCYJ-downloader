    "09/27/2022 Pre-Exit Conference\n09/27/2022 Inspection Completed-BCAL Sub. Compliance\nALLEGATION: Staff 1 pushed Youth A against a wall causing a bump to her\nhead. She has two scratches and an open sore below her knee.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 9/20/22, I spoke to consultant 1 for update on patterns and trends in the agency.\nOn 9/20/22 spoke to Complainant 1. Complainant 1 did not report any new details to the\nallegations other than she is currently working with Youth A on what are truths and what\nare lies. Complainant 1 reported Youth A lies often and creates stories.\nOn 9/20/22, I spoke to DHHS Worker 1; allegations and scheduling was completed.\nDHHS Worker 1 saw Youth A face to face and verified that Youth A had an open sore\non her leg, but it was from picking an old scab.\nOn 9/20/22, a phone call and email was completed to Administrator 1 requesting\ndocuments for the investigation.\nThe following documents were reviewed throughout the course of the investigation:\n• Incident Report\n• Personnel files\n• Medical documents\n• Documentation Policy\n• Staff 1 Performance Evaluation\nI reviewed the video of the incident on 9/27/22. The incident occurred on 9/11/22\nat 8:15pm:\nYouth A was in the entrance of her doorway. Staff 1 and Staff 2 were with her. Staff 1\npushes Youth A twice. Staff 2 is standing and watching. The video did not show the\ninside of the room; therefore, it was undetermined how Youth A hit her head.\nI reviewed the Incident reports for 9/11/22.\nThe first incident report noted the time of incident was at 8:40pm. Staff 2 wrote the\nreport. Staff 2 did not report that Youth A was pushed in the incident report. Staff 2\n3",
    "wrote: “staff helped her inside her room. [Youth A] began kicking the door and lost her\nbalance ending with her tripping over the basket of sheets causing her to hit her head\non the wall.”\nThe second incident report was written by Staff 1. Time of the incident was documented\nas 8:40pm. Staff 1 does not report that she pushed Youth A into her room. Staff 1\nreported, “I then assisted her back in her room and closed the door. Youth A started\nkicking the door and lost her footing and tripped over a basket and hit her head on the\nwall.”\nI reviewed the Hurley Medical Documents:\nDiagnosis was hematoma of scalp. The instructions from the hospital were to provide\nMotrin or Tylenol as well as an ice pack on her head.\nI reviewed Staff 1’s Performance evaluation dated 1/25/22. Staff 1 received 2 out of\n4 ratings for the following:\n• not reviewing safety plans or ICMPS consistently\n• professionalism with children and staff (management has addressed these\nissues)\n• she actively asks questions concerning policies and procedures…sometimes\nStaff 1 doesn’t know what to do in quick crisis so she will ask for help until she\nfully understands\nI discussed disciplinary action of Staff 1 with Administrator 1.\nStaff 1 has received a written warning on 11/22/21 for leaving while a crisis was\noccurring.\nStaff 1 received a memo when she did not use de-escalation techniques outlined in TCI\n(Therapeutic Crisis Intervention) and grabbed a phone out of a youth’s hand.\n**It is to be noted that Staff 1 was terminated on 9/21/22 due to having ten attendance\npoints.\nStaff 2 did not have any disciplinary action in her file.\nAll interviews were conducted by telephone with DHHS Worker 1 who was present with\ninterviewee.\nI interviewed Youth A via telephone on 9/27/22. Youth A reported she was afraid of Staff\n1. Youth A reported it was shift change and Staff 1 said, “Shut up ugly” and then stated\nshe was going to “stab me in my throat”. Youth A reported that Staff 2 attempted to stop\nher. Youth A reported she was in her room and Staff 1 threatened to “beat her up”.\nYouth A reported Staff 1 grabbed a knife from the kitchen and cut her on her chest with\nthe knife. Youth A reported that Staff 1 pushed her up against the wall and cut her.\n4",
    "Youth A reported that no one believes her, and the other youth tell her it is all in her\nhead.\nI interviewed Staff 2. Staff 2 reported they were initially outside, and Youth A was\nrefusing to come inside when it was time. When they finally got her inside, Youth A went\ninto her room and began kicking the doors. Staff 2 reported when she went to do room\nchecks, she went into Youth A’s room and asked her if she was doing okay. Youth A\nthen got out of her room and Staff 2 asked for assistance. Staff 2 reported that when\nStaff 1 came she held the room door open and was not looking at Staff 1 or Youth A.\nStaff 2 reported she heard Youth A fall but didn’t know how she fell. Staff 2 reported\nthere was a basket of laundry in her room and Youth A told her she fell over the basket.\nStaff 2 reported she didn’t see the incident but did write the incident report. Staff 2\nreported she wrote in the incident report that Youth A fell over the basket although she\ndidn’t see it. Staff 2 reported that Youth A can be dramatic if she doesn’t get her way\nand will blame others.\nA follow up interview was conducted with Staff 2 after video observation was completed.\nStaff 2 did not change her story to the incident.\nI reviewed the Documentation Policy:\nThe Incident report needs to be completed in its entirety.\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.158 Interventions standards and prohibitions.\n(1) An institution child caring institution shall establish and\nfollow written policies and procedures that prohibit the\nfollowing forms of intervention:\n(a) any type of physical punishment including but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or pushing\na youth on any part of their body.\nANALYSIS: Video observation concluded Staff 1 had pushed Youth A into\nher room minimally twice. Pushing a youth is not an approved or\nappropriate behavior management technique.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\n5",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4109 Program statement.\n(1) An institution shall have and follow a current written\nprogram\nstatement which specifically addresses all of the following:\n(c) Policies and procedures pertaining to admission,\ncare, safety, and supervision, methods for addressing\nresidents' needs, implementation of treatment plans, and\ndischarge of residents.\nANALYSIS: The agency has a policy for documentation writing. The incident\nreport was not completed with all of the facts from the incident. It\nwas clear on the video that Staff 1 pushed Youth A into the\nbedroom. It is also clear that the incident did not occur at\n8:40pm but at 8:10pm. Staff 2 added details to the report that\nshe did not witness through her own omission.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nAPPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4112 Criminal history check, subject to requirements; staff\nqualifications.\n(4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n6",
    "ANALYSIS: Staff 1 was hired on 1/27/20. Her most recent Performance e\nEvaluation noted areas of improvement in reading client\ncentered safety interventions, professionalism, and handling\ncrisis situations. Staff 1 was provided with a written warning for\nleaving a crisis situation and a memo for not using de-escalation\ntechniques outlined in TCI. Staff 1 had received trainings, a\nwarning, and goals from her supervisor to perform better, but\nwas unable to perform her duties as assigned.\nStaff 2 has completed all trainings required and was unable to\nfulfill her position as assigned. Staff 2 lied to the investigators,\nby stating she did not see anything between Youth A and Staff\n1, although the video clearly shows Staff 2 standing in the direct\nvicinity of Staff 1 and Youth A and visually facing them during\nthe incident. Staff 2 also omitted information on her written\nincident reports and added information that she did not actually\nsee.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that the license remain unchanged. Upon acceptance of an\napproved CAP.\n10/18/22\n________________________________________\nVenus M.
