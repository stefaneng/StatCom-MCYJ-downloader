Staff 1 was terminated. In both\ninvestigations Youth A refused to be interviewed.\nI spoke with MDHHS Specialist 1 on 08/18/2023. She reported\nYouth A is placed at Bay Pines facility, so MDHHS Specialist 2\nwent out on 08/18/2023 and verified the well-being of Youth A.\nShe said Youth A refused to speak to MDHHS Specialist 2 in the\nprevious investigation, so MDHHS Specialist did not attempt to\ninterview Youth A.\nI spoke with Complainant/Probation Officer on 08/18/2023.\nProbation Officer reported Youth A disclosed that when she was\nplaced at Lincoln Center, she had sexual intercourse with Staff 1.\nNo further information was reported.\nI spoke with Lincoln Center Director on 08/21/2023 and informed\nher of the complaint involving Staff 1.

She arranged for\nYouth A to be interviewed by her Probation Officer on 08/31/2023,\nsince Youth A will not speak to MDHHS Specialist.\nOn 08/31/2023 Youth A was interviewed by her Probation Officer\nvia video conference call. Youth A reported when she was placed\nat Lincoln Center in February of 2023. Staff 1 and she had sexual\nintercourse at least 10 times. She said it would happen when Staff\n1 dispensed evening medication around 8 pm, Staff 1 would go in\nher room, and they had sex in her room. Youth A could not recall\nwhat Staff 1 was wearing and when they had sex. She said she is\nthe one that initiated the sexual relationship.\nI spoke with Lincoln Center Director on 08/31/2023 in reference to\nreviewing video coverage for the month in February. Director\nreported video is only preserved for 90 days, therefore video for\nthe month of February 2023 was not available.\nOn 09/08/2023 a second video conference call was held with\nMDHHS Specialist 1, Probation Officer, and Youth A. An attempt\nwas made by MDHHS Specialist to forensically interview Youth A.\nYouth A refused to answer any questions and said she does not\nwant to speak to MDHHS or DCWL.\nOn 09/08/2023, I interviewed Highland Park Detective, in\ncollaboration with MDHHS Specialist 1. Detective confirmed\nreceiving the law enforcement notification and will be contacting\nStaff 1 to schedule an interview.\nOn 09/20/2023, Staff 1 was interviewed by Detective at Highland\nPark Police Department. Staff 1 denied having a sexual\nrelationship with Youth A or any other youth at Lincoln Center. He\nreported his only interaction with Youth A was when he passed\nmedication. He said the only time he went to Youth A’s room was\nto do a room search when Youth A threatened to self-harm, and\nhe and another staff would search the room. He denied being in\nYouth A’s room alone, having a sexual relationship, or talking to\nYouth A about sex.\nOn 10/12/2023 a predisposition conference call was held with\nMDHHS Specialist and management. There is a finding for sexual\nabuse by Staff 1 resulting in his on central registry\n3",
    "Analysis These allegations were previously investigated in\nSIR2023C0000464 and SIR2023C0000484 and the facility was\ncited for Staff 1 making inappropriate comments, touching youths,\nand having a confirmed case resulting in Staff 1 being terminated.\nTherefore, there will not be any additional rule violations for this\ninvestigation.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nOctober 16, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nNabiha Rizk Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nOctober 17, 2023\n______________________________________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n4"
