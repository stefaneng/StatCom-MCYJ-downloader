METHODOLOGY\n09/22/2021 Special Investigation Intake\n2021C0207030\n09/22/2021 Special Investigation Initiated - Face to Face\nTeams meeting with Chief Administrator, CEO, and Director.\nDirector acknowledged that notification to DCWL did not occur\nrelated to Youth A's AWOL from his home pass. The Director\npreviously reported this in an email on 09/21/21.\n09/22/2021 Contact - Document Sent\nEmails exchanged with the Director, CA and CEO. Pre-exit\nfindings provided via email.\nALLEGATION:\nFacility did not follow proper notification procedures after a youth went AWOL on a\nhome pass.\nINVESTIGATION:\nOn 09/21/21, the complainant reported that there was a resident who did not return\nfrom AWOLP. The report was sent to DCWL central office for processing and was\nopened for investigation.\nIn an email from the Director on 09/21/21, the Director reported that the youth failed\nto return to Lincoln Center on 9/11/21 from his reintegration visit. The Director\nindicated that an incident report and MiSACWIS report were completed, and noted, ‘I\nfailed to contact Licensing as I’m covering for Director 2 while he’s on vacation. This\nis my mishap.’\nDocumentation reviewed as part of this investigation:\n Unusual Incident Report Summary\n Home visit documentation\n MiSACWIS AWOLP incident report-submitted 09/13/21\n2",
    "APPLICABLE RULE\nR 400.4150 Incident reporting.\n(3) If an institution determines that a youth is absent\nwithout legal permission, then the institution shall\nimmediately report the information to law enforcement, the\nparent/legal guardian or next of kin, the licensing authority,\nand the referring agency.\nANALYSIS: The facility is in violation of the rule and acknowledged that\nwhile one Director was temporarily out and another covered his\nduties, the notification of AWOLP in this case was not\ncompleted timely as required. Technical Assistance was\nprovided in the facility’s last renewal report that all AWOLPs,\nincluding those of youth who do not return from home passes,\nmust be reported to all individuals in the licensing rule, which\nincludes notification to licensing.\nCONCLUSION: VIOLATION ESTABLISHED\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the findings of this investigation, I recommend no change to the current\nlicense status. This recommendation is contingent on the facility submitting an\nacceptable corrective action plan for the noted violation.\nOctober 22, 2021\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nNovember 1, 2021\n________________________________________\nClaudia Triestram Date\nArea Manager\n3"
