Youth A then took the toothpaste, threw it\non the floor and began stomping the toothpaste. As a result,\nAdministrator 1 punched Youth A in the gut causing Jordan to fall\ninto the tub. Youth A began crying and screaming. Minutes later,\nAdministrator 1 hit Youth A two more times. It is unknown where\nYouth A was hit, it is unknown if Youth A sustained any marks or\nbruises or sought medical attention.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed via phone on 8/11/2025. He\nreported never hitting Youth A and came upon the bathroom when\nYouth A was dysregulated after Staff 1 pushed Youth A to finish.\nHe reported when Staff 1 hurried Youth A, Youth A became\nflustered and began to get aggressive. Administrator 1 reported\nYouth A had fallen after slipping in the bathroom and when trying\nto assist Youth A to a standing position, Administrator 1 placed his\nhand on Youth A’s back. Because Youth A had received a\nsunburn earlier in the day (Administrator 1 denied knowing this\ninformation) when Youth A’s back was touched, Youth A\nscreamed out loud. Administrator 1 reported Staff 1 left the\nbathroom right after Administrator 1 entered the bathroom and\nnever came back to look in on Youth A. Administrator 1 reported\nStaff 1 struggles with her own trauma and informed Administrator\n1 that she heard her father beat her mother causing Staff 1’s\ntrauma.

He described\nYouth A as a “really good kid” who gets “upset quickly at times”.\nHe again reported because Staff 1 was pushing Youth A to hurry,\nYouth A became upset and began destroying stuff (toothpaste,\nhygiene caddy, and pen flashlight) in the bathroom.
