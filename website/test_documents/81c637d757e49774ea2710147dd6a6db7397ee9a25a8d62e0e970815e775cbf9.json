The Chief Administrator submitted a hard copy of the\nDHS-1105 indicating the FTM had been completed however it was not uploaded into\nthe MISACWIS system.\nFOM 722-06H Case Contact – Quality Visits\nQuality visits between the caseworker and child have been\nfound to produce positive outcomes for children in foster\ncare. A quality visit is defined as one in which the\ncaseworker: • Can meet with each child individually,\nwithout the presence of other individuals, to give the child\nan opportunity to ask questions as well as discuss the\ncurrent placement. • Views the child's bedroom and\nsleeping arrangements. • Verifies safe sleep environments\nand practices for infants under 12 months. • Assesses each\nchild’s educational, medical, dental, mental health and\nother needs and takes appropriate action or offers services\nin response to the identified needs of each child. • Shows\ninterest in the child to build and establish rapport. • Shares\nand explains the case plan, including the plan for parenting\ntime, visits with siblings and other relatives, and the child's\npermanency plan, in a developmentally appropriate way\nwhile allowing the child to ask questions and express\nviewpoints.\nTwo of 6 foster care files reviewed lacked documentation of quality visits.

EVALUATION OF RENEWAL PERIOD\nThere were no substantiated incidents of maltreatment in care during this\nlicensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated child abuse and/or neglect during\nthis licensing period.\nThere were no incidents of substantiated corporal punishment during this\nlicensing period.\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans not related to\nmaltreatment during this licensing period.\nA corrective action plan, approved August 26, 2021, was submitted in response to\nthe Interim Inspection completed on August 5, 2021. There was one repeat violation\nestablished during the current Renewal Inspection regarding the timely entering of\nface to face contacts into the MISACWIS system. The agency continues to\nsuccessfully address and correct rule and policy violations established during the\nprevious annual inspection.\nChief Administrator Assessment (CAA)\nThe CAA was reviewed and it was thorough in addressing violations and CAP\nsuccesses during the licensing period. The CA indicated staff turnover and the\npandemic has presented challenges for the agency. The CA also indicated that the\nCTWI training falls short of preparing workers for the challenges of the foster care\nworker position. The CA indicated that the training online has it’s benefits and\n6",
    "drawbacks. The CA also indicated that the MISACWIS system is cumbersome for\nworkers and staff and it is hoped that the new system will be more user friendly.\nInterviews:\nInterviews were conducted with six staff. Three of the staff interviewed were recently\nemployed and had completed CTWI training and had caseloads. Each of the three\nstaff indicated that they receive competent and supportive supervision from their\nsupervisor as well as other administrative staff. They also reported that they feel\nthey are part of a team that is supportive. Administrative staff interviewed spoke of\nthe challenges they meet with staff turnover, the effects of the pandemic, and\nfrequent system and policy changes. Administrative staff were positive regarding the\nstaff and the team at the agency.\nField Analyst Findings:\nThe Field Analyst identified and generated two safety alerts during her visits to the\nfoster/relative homes. A safety alert dated April 1, 2022, was corrected by the\nagency on the same date. The safety concern was a missing doorknob on a child’s\nbedroom door.\nA second safety alert generated on April 21, 2022, identified the home missing\nsmoke alarms, a carbon monoxide detector, and a gun in a closet which was not\nlocked. The safety alert was resolved on May 5, 2022. The agency had also initiated\na special investigation, #2022C0630800, to address the deficiencies in the home.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable licensing\nstatutes and rules and/or MISEP requirements and/or contract/policy. Upon receipt of\nan acceptable corrective action plan, it is recommended that the facility will be issued a\nrenewal of their regular license.\nJune 9, 2022\n________________________________________\nDoug Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nJune 13, 2022\n________________________________________\nKari Muntean Date\nArea Manager\n7"
