Supervisor 1 was\ninterviewed at that time. She was familiar with the allegations\nmade and confirmed that there had never been any formal\ngrievances filed by Youth A or any other youth in the last few\nmonths regarding food or drink at the facility.\nCook 1 was interviewed on 05/27/2023 during this unannounced\nface-to-face visit at the facility. He stated that he has heard\ncomplaints about food cooked at the facility in the past but always\nclarifies if it is about unsafe or inedible food, or personal\npreferences. Cook 1 stated that he has not been told that any\nfood he has cooked has been unsafe to eat and described safety\nprecautions he takes in order to prevent that from occurring. Cook\n1 stated that, because of this exact type of concern, most of the\nfood items that they serve the youth are pre-cooked and frozen.\nDuring this interview Cook 1 was not able to locate a food\nthermometer. He stated that he normally has it on his person\nwhile cooking but did not that day and did not offer a specific\nreason as to why.\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, Youth E and Youth F were\ninterviewed on 05/24/2023 separately during this unannounced\nface-to-face visit to the facility.

Cook 2 provided a list of temperatures that each type of\nmeat needs to be cooked to in order for it to be safe and edible.\nHe stated that there is always a chance that something is not\ncooked correctly, but in the last few years of working for the\norganization he did not believe he had produced anything unsafe\nto eat and he had not heard from any youth or other staff that was\n3",
