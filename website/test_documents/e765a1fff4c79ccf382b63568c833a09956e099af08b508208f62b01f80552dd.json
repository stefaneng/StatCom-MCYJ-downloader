    "The special evaluation was also incomplete as it did not describe how a child was\nremoved from a room on several occasions.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (2) An agency shall complete written service plans\nfor each child and parent or parents, as follows:\n• (b) Within 120 calendar days after the initial\nremoval and at least once every 90\ncalendar days thereafter.\nOne of three foster care files reviewed contained an updated service plan that was\ncompleted late.\nCPA Rule 400.12418 Development of service plans\n• (5) An agency shall involve the child's parent or\nparents and the foster parents in the development\nof service plans to enable the parent or parents\nand foster parents to understand the plan for the\nchild and the parents' and the foster parent's role\nin assisting the agency in carrying out the plan.

    "relevant parties and provided them with a copy of the treatment plan would meet\nthe rule when obtaining signatures was not possible.\n• The agency was informed that an addendum to special evaluation\n#2025SEC0000170 should be completed addressing the concern of how the\nfoster mother removed the child from a room several times.

    "Staff Interviews\nStaff interviewed reported feeling supported by their supervisor however the\nagency has been running short staffed due to staff turnover and this creates\nadditional stress in trying to keep up with workloads. Staff reported they are\nhopeful additional hiring will alleviate the workload and job stress.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency is located in a modern DHHS building in Baraga. There is sufficient\noffice space for staff and a lobby that is staffed to serve the public. CHRI\ndocuments were observed to be secured.\nVII.

RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nAugust 15, 2025\n________________________________________\nDouglas W Turrill Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 18, 2025\n________________________________________\nSamantha Way Date\nArea Manager\n5"
