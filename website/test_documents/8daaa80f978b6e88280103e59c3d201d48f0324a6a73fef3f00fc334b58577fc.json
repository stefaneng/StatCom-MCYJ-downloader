Administrator 1 reported the\nnurse completed an assessment after the escort.\nI spoke to DHHS Worker 1, scheduling and allegations were\ndiscussed.\nI reviewed the video of the incident.\nThe incident is dated 9/16/23. I watched video footage from two\ndifferent camera positions. Video footage was from 7:03:26pm-\n7:15:57pm. Youth A and Youth B were in the pod with Staff 1.\nSecurity 1 and Security 2 entered the pod and Youth A pushes\nSecurity 1 into the door and then both Youth A and Youth B\nattempted to grab things from their pockets. Staff 1 has left the\narea. Youth A and Youth B begin pushing and shoving staff. Staff\n1 comes back into the room and does not intervene, then\nSupervisor 1 enters the pod and both Security 1 and Security 2\nleave the pod. At 7:07:10 Youth A walks behind Supervisor 1 and\ngrabs or hits the back of his head. Supervisor 1 then turns around\nand pushes Youth A up against the wall and holds him there.\nYouth A does get released from this. At 7:09:00 Security 1 comes\nback onto the pod.

They transport Youth A into his room.\nYouth A resisted the entire time. Security 3 and Security 1\nremined in the room. There was no camera footage inside the\nbedroom.\nInterviews were conducted with DHHS Worker 1 at the facility\nunless otherwise noted:\nSupervisor 2:\nSupervisor 2 reported he had entered the pod because staff had\ncalled for “security” to come help. Supervisor 2 reported he knew\nthat Security 1 was the target of Youth A. Youth A reported to\nSupervisor 2 that Security 1 made sexual comments about Youth\nA’s grandma.

Then Youth A\nhit him and Security 1 stated, “bro what you want?” Security 3\nreported Supervisor 2 told Security 1 to leave the room and he\ndid.\nI reviewed the following documents:\nUnusual Incident Report Summary: Date of Incident 9/16/23 at\n7:05pm. Supervisor 1 write the report. The incident was noted\n5",
    "as a “resident assault on staff.” It noted, “…This writer, [and]\nSupervisor 2, Security 3 and Security 4 arrived on the scene and\ntried to verbally deescalate the situation but was unsuccessful.\nYouth A and Youth B continued their assaultive behaviors and\nwere escorted to their rooms by Security 4, Security 3, and\nSecurity 1. Both residents are scheduled to examined by the\nfacility nurse.”\nMedial Assessment: Medical assessment was dated 9/18/23.\nYouth A was seen in the pod. Assessment documents youth\nstates he was choked by “someone” in his bedroom. Assessment\nnotes superficial scratches on his neck and contact was made to\nAdministrator 1 to report to CPS. Order was completed for neck x-\nray.\nMedical Assessment: Medical assessment was dated 9/19/23 in\nthe clinic. Youth reported, “security had him face down on the\nground and a knee to his upper back.” Youth reports neck pain. X-\nrays were sent to the doctor.\nTrident Care Imaging: Imaging assessed “no evidence of acute\nfracture or malalignment. No significant degenerative changes\nidentified. Soft tissues are unremarkable.”\nHandle with Care Manual: The one person and two-person\ntakedown method does not include using a wall to help assist with\nthe restraint. A two-person takedown, in step 7, show the youth is\ndropped to their knee position, one staff in the Primary Restraint\nTechnique (PRT) and the other staff with his arms around the\nknees of the youth bringing him to a sit-down position. The two-\nperson escort technique shows two staff facing the same direction\nas the youth, one staff arm placed over the youths forearm and\nthe staffs hand placed on the upper back of the youth, while the\nstaffs other hand is holding the youth’s wrist.\nI reviewed the SJJS Behavioral Management System,\nbehavioral Intervention techniques, Safe Physical\nIntervention, and Use of Seclusion Rooms policy:\nDefinition: Physical Restraint: Touching the youth and\nrestricting his/her movement in any manner. Only an\napproved SJJS technique may be used.\nSafe Physical Intervention Techniques: all instances of\nphysical intervention must be reported to the immediate\nsupervisor and documented on the Unusual Incident Report\n6",
    "summary and the appropriate restraint, seclusion,\naggregate seclusion forms.\nDHHS Worker 1 reported there was not a preponderance of\nevidence for a confirmed case.\nAnalysis The restraint of Youth A was not completed in a safe and\nappropriate manner.\n• During the restraint of Youth, A, Security 1 had his right\nelbow pressed up against Youth A’s chin to hold Youth A’s\nhead and restrict movement. Security 1 held this position\nfor 28 seconds.\n• Youth A was restrained up against the wall and held there\nthroughout the restraint in the pod. Handle with Care does\nnot demonstrate restraints completed up against a wall.\n• Security 3 reported that while in the bedroom Security 1\nhad his forearm on the chest of Youth A. Security 3\nreported they had initially fell to the ground in the bedroom,\nyet they both held Youth A’s arms down, outside of their\nrestraint module.\n• Youth A had reported that he was attempting to go after\nSecurity 1 by attempting to go into Security 1’s pockets and\ntold the staff involved that Security 1 had name called his\ngrandmother. Although the name calling was not true,\nSecurity 1 was the target of Youth A’s assaultive behavior.\nSecurity 1 had left the pod at one point due to being the\ntarget of Youth A, but then came back in to assist with the\nde-escalation and then restraint. Based on video footage\nand interviews there were more than enough staff to\ncomplete a Handle with Care restraint.\nConclusion Violation Established\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4158 Intervention standards and prohibitions\nSection (1) A child caring institution shall establish and follow written\nDescription policies and procedures that prohibit the following forms of\nintervention:\n(a) Any type of physical punishment including, but not\nlimited to:\n(ii) Hitting or striking, throwing, kicking, pulling, or\npushing a youth on any part of their body.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\n7",
    "Allegation Staff pushed youth up against a wall.\nInvestigation I reviewed the video of the incident.\nThe incident is dated 9/16/23. I watched video footage from two\ndifferent camera positions. Video footage was from 7:03:26pm-\n7:15:57pm. Youth A and Youth B were in the unit with Staff 1.\nSecurity 1 and Security 2 entered the pod and Youth A pushes\nSecurity 1 into the door and then both Youth A and Youth B\nattempted to grab things from their pockets. Staff 1 has left the\narea. Youth A and Youth B begin pushing and shoving staff. Staff\n1 comes back into the room and does not intervene, then\nSupervisor 1 enters the pod and both Security 1 and Security 2\nleave the pod. At 7:07:10 Youth A walks behind Supervisor 1 and\ngrabs or hits the back of his head. Supervisor 1 then turns around\nand pushes Youth A up against the wall and holds him there.\nYouth A does get released from this.\nSupervisor 1 reported that Youth A touched the top of his head,\nand they did a two-man restraint up against the wall. Supervisor 1\nreported that Youth A was swinging and resisting the restraint.\nI reviewed the following documents:\nHandle with Care Manual does not include pushing or holding\nyouth up against the wall as part of the Primary Restraint\nTechnique.\nSupervisor 1’s personnel file was reviewed, and training has been\ncompleted.\nAnalysis The video observation shows Supervisor 1 pushing Youth A up\nagainst a wall. A two-man restraint was not completed as outlined\nin the Handle with Care Manual.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000437: Intake 5/2/23, CAP Approved\n2023C0000650SI: Intake 7/26/23, CAP Approved\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4112\nSection (4) A person with ongoing duties shall have both of the\nDescription following:\n(a) Ability to perform duties of the position assigned.\n8",

When\nsecurity came in, he went to use the restroom. When he came\nback, the pod was in chaos. Staff 1 reported that Security 2 asked\nfor help, and he told her it wasn’t his job to help deescalate the\nkids. Staff 1 reported it was the security officers’ jobs to do that\nand they were the ones that escalated the kids, so he didn’t help.\nSecurity 2:\nSecurity 2 reported that Staff 1 left the area and did not help them.\nI reviewed the Job Description for Youth Worker:\n• This position is directly responsible for the daily\nsupervision, safety, security, welfare, and progress of the\nresidents in care.\n• De-escalates emotional situations and performs individual\nrestraints and physical interventions as the situation\nrequires.\n• Ability to act quickly and respond to all emergencies with\nappropriate techniques, (e.g. de-escalation techniques,\nsafe physical management techniques, emergency\nprocedures, first aid, CPR, etc.)\nStaff 1 has completed new hire training and was provided the job\ndescription.\nAnalysis Staff 1 has been trained and has received his full job description.\nAlthough he has been given these tools to perform his job, Staff 1\ndid not feel obligated to help provide for the security and safety of\nthe staff or youth on the pod.\nConclusion Repeat Violation Established\n2023C0000484: Intake 5/23/23, CAP Approved\n2023C0000575: Intake 6/28/23, CAP Approved\n2023C0000437: Intake 5/2/23, CAP Approved\n2023C0000486: Intake 5/24/23.

    "Security 1 reported they escorted Youth B into his room first.\nSecurity 3 saw Youth A grab the back of Supervisor 1’s head and\nthen was instructed by Supervisor 1 to escort Youth A into his\nroom. Security 3 reported that Security 1 and Supervisor 2 were\nhelping with the escort, and he stepped in as well.\nAnalysis Youth A was restrained on 9/16/23. An Incident report was written\nbut it did not note that Youth A was restrained. The incident was\nwritten up as a “youth assault on staff.”\nTechnical Assistance: The word “escort” was used in the\nincident report and stated by Supervisor 1, Security 1, and\nSecurity 3 and Administrator 1 in interviews. Based on interviews\nand video observation the facility is using the term “escort” in lieu\nof restraint. Acts 116 722.112b (h) defines “physical restraint” as\nthe application of physical force without the use of a device, for\nthe purpose of restraining the free movement of a minor child’s\nbody. Personal restraint does not include: (iii) Holding a minor’s\nchild’s hand, wrist, shoulder, or arm to safely escort him or her\nfrom 1 area to another.\nThe agency will need to retrain all staff and update policies to\nreflect the correct definitions are being used and applied when\ndetermining the difference between an “escort” (voluntary escort\nwith no physical force applied by staff or restraining the free\nmovement of the youth) and a restraint (application of physical\nforce and restraining the free movement of youth).\nConclusion Violation Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n10/24/23\n______________________________________\nVenus M.
