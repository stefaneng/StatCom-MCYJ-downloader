Supervisor reported the video showed multiple\ntimes when Staff 1 could have left, but he didn’t. Supervisor\nreported Staff 1 used to be a youth in the home and worked as a\nyouth specialist in a Supervised Independent Living Placement\nprior to becoming the House Parent for Casa Del Sol in June\n2022. Supervisor reported Staff 1 gets along with the youth and\nother staff very well and there have been no incidents involving\nhim previously. Supervisor reported the incident is not reflective of\nStaff 1’s or Youth A's typical behavior. Supervisor reported Staff 1\nwas suspended pending investigation.\nYouth A was interviewed in person at the facility on 1/27/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth A reported Youth B\ncame home from school sick yesterday, so Youth A went into\nYouth B’s room to check on him and see if he was okay. Youth A\nreported Staff 1 told him to leave the room, so he did. Youth A\n2",
    "reported he became mad because Staff 1 grabbed Youth A’s neck\nwhen Staff 1 and Youth B were leaving the home. He reported he\ndoesn’t like when people touch him, so Staff 1’s actions triggered\nhim. Youth A reported he told Staff 1, “why don’t you come back\nand do that again?”. Youth A stated Staff 1 came back inside the\nhouse and was walking towards him, so Youth A grabbed Staff 1.\nYouth A stated Staff 1 pulled him, pushed him, and choked him by\ngrabbing Youth A’s neck with his hand and pushing him against\nthe wall. Youth A stated Staff 1 squeezed Youth A’s neck when he\nwas holding him against the wall. He reported during the\naltercation, Staff 2 came in and kept telling Staff 1 to let Youth A\ngo. Youth A reported Staff 1 told Youth A he could not hit anyone\nin the house, including staff. Youth A reported Staff 2 pulled Staff\n1 off Youth A, but Staff 1 kept coming back. Staff 2 separated\nthem and then Staff 1 left with Youth B. Youth A reported Staff 2\nwas trying to help the situation and was trying to help everyone\ncalm down. Youth A reported Staff 2 did not do anything wrong\nand did not hurt him in any way. Youth A reported he feels safe in\nthe home if Staff 1 is not there.\nYouth B was interviewed in person at the facility on 2/2/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth B reported he came\nhome sick from school on 1/26/23. Youth B stated Youth A came\nin his room and accused Youth B of being a liar for coming home\nsick. Staff 1 came in and told Youth A to leave Youth B’s room,\nbut instead of leaving, Youth A began saying bad words to Staff 1.\nStaff 1 asked Youth A to leave again, but he still would not leave.\nStaff 1 and Staff 2 asked Youth B to leave his room since Youth A\nwouldn’t leave. Staff 1 said he was going to the store and asked\nYouth B to come with him. Youth B reported on their way out of\nthe house, Staff 1 touched Youth A’s shoulder and told Youth A\nnext time he went into someone’s room without permission, Youth\nA would lose $10. When Youth B and Staff 1 were close to the\ndoor, Youth A told Staff 1 if he touched him again, there would be\nconsequences. Staff 1 turned his back and Youth A attacked him\nby grabbing him around the neck from behind. Youth B reported\nStaff 2 came to help separate them and Youth A became more\nescalated. Youth B reported he did not see Staff 1 or Staff 2 do\nanything inappropriate and did not see Staff 1 choke Youth A.\nWhen Youth B and Staff 1 left the home, Youth B stated Staff 1\nhad tears in his eyes. Youth B reported Staff 1 is one of the best\nstaff at Casa Del Sol and he treated everyone well.\nYouth C was interviewed in person at the facility on 2/2/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Youth C reported he was in\nhis room when the incident began. When he came out of his room,\n3",
    "Youth C saw Youth A with his arms around Staff 1’s neck and\nStaff 2 was trying to separate them. When Staff 2 was trying to\nseparate them, Youth A said, “you want to fight me too?” and\nbegan fighting with Staff 2. Youth C stated Staff 1 and Staff 2 both\ntold Youth A he could not hit them or anyone else, but he would\nnot listen. Youth C reported he did not see Staff 1 or Staff 2 do\nanything inappropriate and did not see Staff 1 choke Youth A.\nStaff 2 was interviewed in person at the facility on 2/2/23 in\nconjunction with MDHHS Worker. Staff 2 reported he picked up\nYouth B from school, brought him back to the house and told him\nto go to his room since he was sick. Staff 2 was in the kitchen\nwhen Youth A entered Youth B’s room and Staff 1 went in the\nroom to ask Youth A to leave. Staff 2 reported Youth A is known to\nbe a very mean child and escalates quickly. Youth A told Staff 1\nhe was not going to leave the room. Staff 2 then went to the room\nto help and asked Youth B to come into the kitchen since Youth A\nwouldn’t leave Youth B’s room. Staff 1 told Youth B to come with\nhim to the store. Youth A had left Youth B’s room and was sitting\nin the living room. Staff 2 was still in the kitchen and did not see\nhow the altercation began. However, shortly after, he heard a loud\ncommotion, went to the living room, and saw Youth A’s arm\naround Staff 1’s neck choking him. Staff 2 reported Staff 1 was\ncompletely defenseless, so Staff 2 tried to separate them by\ngetting in between them. Staff 2 reported he was trying to get\nYouth A to go to his room because he was in an altered and\nescalated state. Staff 2 reported Youth A would not go to his room\nand instead punched Staff 2 in the abdomen and chest. Staff 2\nreported he did not see Staff 1 grab Youth A by his neck or choke\nhim. Staff 2 stated if Staff 1 would have left the situation, Youth A\nwould have likely calmed down because Staff 1 was out of sight.\nStaff 2 reported Staff 1 was not utilizing skills to de-escalate the\nsituation as Staff 1 was also escalated. Staff 2 reported Youth A\ndoes not respect Staff 1 and frequently refers to Staff 1 as a “dirty\nblack man” or other racially offensive comments. Staff 2 reported\nthere was only one other situation in which Youth A has been\naggressive and he tried to throw a chair at Staff 2, but it hit the\nwall instead.\nStaff 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/22/23. Staff 1 reported\nwhen Youth B came home sick on 1/26/23, Youth A immediately\nstarted picking on Youth B and telling Youth B he was faking\nbeing sick, so he didn’t have to go to school. Youth B tried to go to\nhis room to get away from Youth A, but Youth A went into Youth\nB’s room without permission. Staff 1 told Youth A he needed to\nleave Youth B’s room multiple times, but Youth A refused verbally\n4",
    "and would not move. Staff 2 asked Youth B to leave the room\nsince Youth A wouldn’t, and then Staff 1 decided to take Youth B\nto the store with him. When Staff 1 and Youth B were leaving the\nhome, they walked through the living room and Youth A was\nsitting in a chair in front of the TV. Staff 1 reported he patted Youth\nA's shoulder as he walked past and Youth A said, “come grab my\nneck again”. Staff 1 reported he was shocked, so he came back\ninto the living room and said “I didn’t grab your neck. What are you\ntalking about?”. Staff 1 stated Youth A stood up, so Staff 1 turned\naround to go back towards the door. When he turned around,\nYouth A attacked him from behind and put his arm around Staff\n1’s neck. Staff 1 reported he could have used self-defense but\nchose not to. Staff 1 reported he was running out of breath from\nbeing choked when Staff 2 came in the room to break them up.\nStaff 1 admitted he was mad about Youth A trying to strangle him\nand asked Youth A why he did it. Staff 1 reported he did not choke\nYouth A but did push him up against the wall because Youth A\nwas escalated and trying to attack Staff 2. Staff 1 reported he did\nnot walk away or leave the situation because he was not going to\nleave Staff 2 to fend for himself as they are taught to handle\nsituations as a team. Staff 1 reported he did not feel he was\ntreated fairly by the agency after the situation occurred as he feels\nonly youth’s lives matter in those situations, not employee’s lives.\nVIDEO REVIEWED:\nTwo separate videos of the incident on 1/26/23 were reviewed\nmultiple times throughout the investigation. One video is a camera\nangle from the living room area and the other video is from the\noverhead camera angle of the hallway that connects the living\nroom, kitchen, and bedrooms. The video shows Youth A sitting in\na chair in the living room in front of the TV. Staff 1 walks with\nYouth B past Youth A and Staff 1 puts his hand on Youth A’s\nshoulder, but it is not clear if it is a grab or a pat. Staff 1 and Youth\nB walk out the front door and Youth A says something. Staff 1\nwalks back in the house past Youth B. Staff 1 walks over to Youth\nA and they exchange words. Youth A stands up, Staff 1 turns to\nwalk away and Youth A attacks Staff 1 from behind. Youth A’s\narms/hands are initially around Staff 1’s shoulders, however,\nYouth A then puts his left arm around Staff 1’s neck in a “choke\nhold\" position. Staff 2 then enters the living room and attempts to\nverbally de-escalate Youth A, while trying to separate Youth A and\nStaff 1. Staff 2 successfully releases Youth A’s arm from around\nStaff 1’s neck and Staff 1 steps back. Staff 2 then pulls Youth A’s\nright arm to pull Youth A further away from Staff 1. Staff 1 then\nturns around and grabs Youth A's wrist. Staff 2 again uses verbal\nde-escalation and separates Staff 1 and Youth A. Staff 1 is near\n5",
    "the front door that is being held open by Youth B but does not\nattempt to exit to remove himself from the situation. It should be\nnoted Youth A is not escalated at that time. While Staff 2 bends\ndown to pick something up, Staff 1 goes around behind Staff 2\nand Staff 1 and Youth A begin pushing each other. Staff 2 stands\nup and puts himself in the middle of them again to separate them.\nStaff 1 then puts his left hand around Youth A’s neck, pushes him\nbackwards and holds him against the wall (all while Staff 2 is\nattempting to separate them). They move off the wall into the\nhallway and turn around while Staff 1’s hand remains around\nYouth A’s neck and Staff 2 is attempting to separate them. Staff 2\nfinally separates them and uses his body to block Staff 1 in the\nkitchen while Youth A remains in the hallway. Staff 1 and Youth A\ncontinue to exchange words while Youth A pushes his body\nagainst Staff 2’s body attempting to move him out of the way. Staff\n1 turns around and Staff 2 and Youth A push each other using\ntheir hands. Staff 1 then uses his hand to block Youth A’s\ncontinued advances towards the kitchen to get to Staff 1. Staff 1\ncontinues to stand in the kitchen, look at Youth A and exchange\nwords with him. Youth A continues to try and advance towards the\nkitchen and Staff 2 uses his hands to grab both of Youth A’s wrists\nseparately. Staff 1 gets closer to Staff 2 and Youth A attempts to\nadvance towards him again. Staff 2 releases Youth A’s wrists and\nuses his hands to push Youth A backwards (his hands remain in\ncontact with Youth A due to Youth A resisting). Staff 1 continues\nto push Youth A, guiding him into the hallway, while Staff 1 walks\npast towards the front door. Youth A attempts to push past Staff 2\nto get to Staff 1 and Staff 2 stops Youth A by getting behind him\nand wrapping his arm around Youth A’s shoulders. They continue\nmoving, and Staff 2’s right arm moves up towards Youth A’s neck,\nwhich results in Staff 2 putting Youth A in a headlock position.\nYouth A continues to fight and gets out of Staff 2’s hold. Youth A\nthen attempts to punch Staff 2 multiple times while Staff 2\nattempts to block Youth A’s punches. Staff 2 is still attempting to\nverbally de-escalate Youth A while this is occurring. Staff 1 exits\nthe house through the front door, but then comes back again.\nYouth A stops trying to hit Staff 2 and they begin to talk. However,\nas soon as Staff 1 steps into Youth A’s view, Youth A escalates\nagain and begins trying to hit Staff 1 and Staff 2. Staff 2 blocks\nYouth A, but then grabs Youth A’s wrist and arm while pushing\nhim backwards down the hallway. Staff 1 continues to stand in\nYouth A’s view and Youth A continues to try and advance towards\nhim by pushing and hitting Staff 2. Finally, Staff 1 leaves the\nhome, Youth A calms down, Youth A and Staff 2 talk and then\nYouth A goes to his room.\n6",
