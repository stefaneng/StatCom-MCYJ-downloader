INVESTIGATION\nRule Code & CPA Rule 400.12206 Staff qualifications; volunteer,\nSection contractors on central registry\nDescription (2) A staff member must be of responsible character and suitable\nand able to meet the needs of children and families served by the\nagency.\nViolation Potential Rule or Statute Violation.\nType\nAllegation The foster care worker has physical contact with the foster youth\nby nudging the youth's shoulders, shaking the youth and asking\nfor hugs which has made the youth uncomfortable. Additionally,\nthe agency workers have threatened and intimidated the\ncaregivers related to the caregivers’ own children.\nInvestigation Interviews:\nOn 6/4/2025, I interviewed Complainant by telephone about the\nallegations. Complainant confirmed the information in the\ncomplaint and reported to know the information as true due to her\nfamilial connection to Child A, Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2.\nComplainant reported Child A disclosed to her and Caregiver 1\nand Caregiver 2 that during a home visit by Foster Care Worker\n(FCW) on 5/7/2025, FCW had Child A by the shoulders shaking\nher trying to get her to give her information as to who may have\nsexually maltreated her. Complainant reported Child A reportedly\nnamed someone just to get FCW to stop. Complainant reported\nFCW was aggressive in her questioning of Child A, nudging Child\nA’s shoulder, though Child A had told FCW her action made her\nuncomfortable. FCW also asked for hugs from Child A during that\nhome visit and Child A complied out of feeling obligated.\nComplainant reported inappropriate contact with Child A by FCW\noccurred another time at Child A’s school. FCW arrived at Child\nA’s school unannounced and pulled Child A out of class to\ninterview her. Complainant reported when Child A arrived home,\nChild A was very upset about that interaction with FCW; and Child\nA reported FCW kept asking her for a hug though, Child A said\nshe gave verbal and nonverbal clues to FCW that she was\nuncomfortable giving her a hug. Complainant did not report what\nChild A described the verbal and nonverbal clues to be.\nComplainant said Child A reported feeling obliged to hug FCW\nbecause FCW would not let up on questioning her. Complainant\nreported Child A is now concerned FCW will come to the school\nand will remove her from Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2.\n2",
    "Complainant further reported FCW has lied on Caregiver 1 and\nCaregiver 2, by saying they were refusing to allow her to see the\nchildren; accused Caregiver 1 of having a fake identification; and\nduring a Zoom meeting threatened to remove Caregiver 1’s and\nCaregiver 2’s children. Complainant reported the latter verbal\nthreat was made in the context of if Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2\ndo not do what the agency tells them; should children services get\ninvolved; their children could be at risk for removal. Complainant\nreported FCW’s behavior, has caused significant distress for Child\nA; and that is seen as intimidating and hostile by her and\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2. Complainant also reported she\ndoes not believe FCW meant any harm, related to her affection\ntoward Child A, but FCW goes overboard.\nComplainant added Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 had a meeting\nrelated to the case, where FCW and Foster Care Supervisor\n(FCS) “tag teamed” against Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 “without\nbeing rude to them”, meaning they went back-to-back with issues\nrelated to things the agency was concerned about. FCW and FCS\ntold them if anyone came to the home that the agency did not\nhave clearances for, it could get them in trouble. Complainant\nexpressed concern that FCW and FCS are trying to set Caregiver\n1 and Caregiver 2 up for failure because the agency did not want\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 to have placement of Child A and her\nsiblings. Complainant reported the judge ordered the children\nplaced with Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2; and given that\nComplainant believes FCW may be trying to find a reason to not\nhave the children remain in the home. Complainant did not give\nany specific evidence to support her beliefs. Complainant denied\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 requesting a formal meeting to voice\nconcerns related to FCW and FCS.\nOn 6/4/2025, I interviewed Foster Care Supervisor (FCS) about\nthe allegations by telephone. FCS reported awareness of the\ncomplaint allegations. She denied she or FCW being threatening\nor intimidating toward the foster children or Caregiver 1 and\nCaregiver 2 in any fashion. She denied any knowledge of FCW\nmaking requests for physical attention from Child A, like hugs; or\nof Child A being uncomfortable with FCW. FCS reported FCW has\nnever mentioned that matter as a concern to her; nor had\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2; or anyone else. FCS reported she\nhas accompanied FCW on a home visit to Caregiver 1 and\nCaregiver 2’s home. She has observed FCW engaging with\nChild A several times; and she had never witnessed FCW to be\ninappropriate with Child A. She said FCW has always been\n3",
    "respectful of boundaries with Child A and she has no reason to\nbelieve this allegation to be true. She reported FCW has serviced\nChild A’s case since 2/20/2025, and FCW will be leaving the\nagency; FCW’s last day is 6/5/2025.\nAs to her reportedly threatening that children service could\nremove Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2’s children, FCS admitted\nshe/the agency encouraged Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 to\ncooperate with the agency; and that during a Family Team\nMeeting (FTM)with Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 on 4/24/25 she\nexplained that if in the future children services were to conduct an\ninvestigation pertaining to possible maltreatment, while the\nchildren are in their care, their children could be involved. She\nstated she never used the word removed, nor told Caregiver 1 and\nCaregiver 2 that children service would take away their children.\nFCS reported prior to this complaint, neither Caregiver 1\nCaregiver 2, nor anyone else requested a meeting with her, or any\nperson higher up in the agency’s administration to voice concern\nabout FCW or any staff person. FCS reported she knows\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2, and family members did not like the\nfact that they were going to the school to talk with the children, but\nthey were doing so because they had concerns about the\nplacement, in that Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 had not been\nforthcoming with some information, like how often the children’s\nbirth mother had been visiting the children in the home, the\nchildren having missed a number of days of school, and that Child\nB had been having very frequent urination accidents at school.\nThe agency also had concerns that Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2\nmay have been influencing what the children reported to FCW\nduring home visits: so, the agency believed FCW visiting the\nchildren at school would be appropriate as it would allow for\nprivacy for FCW and children to talk. FCS admitted the children\nwere placed with Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 against\nthe agency’s recommendation but denied any efforts to sabotage\nthe placement. She reported the children came into care due to\nsexual maltreatment on Child A and that the agency was still in\nthe process of assessing the situation. She said the family is very\nclose-knit, many family members seemed to be in denial of\nthe maltreatment. She reported further that Caregiver 1 initially\ndid not want placement of the children; and there was\nconcern that Caregiver 1 may have been coerced by other\nfamily members to commit to the placement. FCS said the agency\nwas trying to ensure for the children’s safety and stability to\nensure the placement was safe and appropriate to meet the\nchildren’s needs.\n4",
    "On 6/4/25 I interviewed Foster Care Worker(FCW) by\ntelephone. FCW reported awareness of this complaint as it was\ndiscussed with the placement collaboration unit today; and that\nthe agency is aware of who the complainant is. FCW denied the\nallegations; and reported information similarly to FCS as it\npertained to Child A and her siblings placement with Caregiver 1\nand Caregiver 2; the agency’s placement concerns; and the\nagency’s continued assessments to ensure the children’s safety.\nShe reported she would not purposefully say or do anything to\nintimidate or harass Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2, because she\nwanted them to work with the agency. FCW reported she knew\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 were not pleased about actions she\nhad to initiate around children services referrals on past issues\nmentioned by Child A, but she denied Caregiver 1 and Caregiver\n2 ever reporting to her or her supervisor, that they felt she had\noverstepped with her interaction with the children.\nFCW reported she was assigned Child A and her siblings’\ncase on 2/20/25. She reported a positive relationship with\nChild A and the other children. She said these children have\nalways been hands on and have always wanted to talk to her.\nShe said the children attach to strangers quickly and did so with\ntheir foster parents prior to their replacement. She said Child A\nopened up to her quickly; and when Child A is stressed,\ncan’t say what she wants, journaling, writing things down has\nhelped Child A express herself. FCW reported Child A had\nexpressed to her that her family has never listened to her, and she\ncouldn’t tell them things about the past, because no one believes\nher. Child A named her grandmother as one of those people.\nFCW reported since Child A’s placement with Caregiver 1 and\nCaregiver 2, Child A has changed drastically. Child A has become\nunreceptive to talking to her about things. FCW reported\nSocial Worker, whom Child A was seeing due to high\nstress levels around visitation with her birth mom, had also\nreported Child A becoming quiet and not wanting to talk with\nanyone. FCW reported because of this change in Child A’s\nbehavior, as well as reports from the school of school absences,\nshe and FCS believed talking with Child A at school would be\nappropriate as a school visit would allow privacy for Child A to\nexpress herself away from Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2’s view.\nFCW reported making a school visit on 5/21/2025, at which\ntime Child A disclosed information to her about a past\nmaltreatment of her when she was eight. FCW said she reported\nthat matter to children services that same day and an FTM\n5",
    "occurred with staff and Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 on 5/23/2025\nrelated to Child A and her siblings’ placement.\nFCW denied Child A being resistant to her or uncomfortable\nwith her at the school visit on 5/21/2025 or the home visit\non 5/6/2025 where Child A disclosed a past maltreatment by a\ncousin, which was also reported to children services, or at other\nhome visits. FCW admitted during the school visit with Child A on\n5/21/2025, Child A told her, she was afraid that FCW may come to\nthe school to remove her from her placement, because FCW was\nalways asking her questions. FCW reported this was the first time\nChild A had ever indicated a fear with her and she assured Child\nA she was not in trouble, and that she was not seeking to remove\nher from her placement.\nFCW also reported being aware that Child A does not like hugs,\nand reported she told Child A that was ok. If Child A felt\nanxious or needed a hug Child A could ask for a hug, and Child A\nwas okay with that. FCW reported the conservation with hugs\ncame up at the school visit because it bothered her that Child A\nwas reporting not wanting to see her. FCW denied any attempt to\nhug Child A at that 5/21/2025 school visit. She said she gave\nChild A her space. FCW also denied hugging or trying to hug\nChild A in the past without Child A’s approval. She said Child A\nhas given her hugs freely in the past, and by Child A’s choice.\nFCW denied ever shaking or pushing Child A in any fashion\nat any home visit. She admitted she may have nudged Child A’s\nshoulder at the home visit on 5/6/2025. She recalled Child A\nstanding close to her and touching Child A’s shoulder as to\nsay “come on”, or “you know”. FCW reported barley remembering\nthe touch. She denied Child A saying don’t touch me or voicing\nany discomfort. She reported she had offered extra time to\nCaregiver 1 and Caregiver 2 related to Child A; and Child A,\nduring the school visit told her that since she is with her family,\nshe no longer needs FCW’s help. FCW reported the latter\nstatement by Child A concerned her because one of the other\nsiblings had reported their caregivers had told them not to tell\nFCW anything.\nOn 6/11/2025 I spoke with Social Worker (SSW) by telephone.\nSSW reported Child A has never mentioned a concern or fear of\nFCW or any agency worker. She stated the only person Child had\nexpressed a concern with had been Child A’s mother. SSW stated\nto her knowledge FCW has only visited Child A at the school\nonce. She observed that interaction for a while; FCW used SSW’s\noffice to talk with Child A. SSW reported that the interaction\n6",
    "between FCW and Child A was appropriate. Child A did not report\nor show any signs of being fearful of FCW; and FCW never tried\nto hug or obtain physical attention from Child A. SSW reported\nthe only person Child A has talked about not wanting to be\nhugged by is Child A’s mother. She said she and Child A have\ndiscussed comfortable touches and it being okay for Child A to\nsay she does not want a hug. SSW stated in her opinion, Child A\nviewed FCW and talking with FCW as a safe space. SSW\nexplained that when Child A has been upset at school, or has\nbeen anxious around seeing her mother, Child A has asked to call\nor text FCW.\nSSW also reported noticing a change in Child A’s behavior in the\nlast several weeks. She reported since Child A moved to her\ncurrent relative placement, Child A has not wanted to talk with her,\nor office staff. She reported Child A is a very articulate child who\ndoes well at expressing herself or writing down her feelings; but\nnow Child A is not saying anything. SSW wondered whether\nsomeone is telling Child A not to talk to people, because Child A\nhad been comfortable doing so, especially when she thinks, no\none can overhear her.\nOn 7/11/2025 I spoke with Caregiver 2 by telephone. Caregiver 2\ninitially stated she had no major concerns with FCW. She stated it\nwas more a concern of Child A not liking what FCW would do to\nget information from her. Caregiver 2 stated FCW “would placate”\nChild A by acting like her friend, say things like” girl you can tell\nme” or putting her hand on Child A’s shoulder to get Child A to\ndisclose things to her. Caregiver 2 said they were also concerned\nwith FCW going to the school to talk Child A; not liking the school\ndue to a kid calling Child A a monkey; and FCW not having a\nconcern with the school. Caregiver 2 said FCW thought she and\nher mom were putting things in Child A’s head to influence Child A\nnegatively against the agency, but that was not true. She also\nreported during a ZOOM meeting FCW and FCS talked about her\nand her mom being at risk of getting involved with children\nservices if they did not do what the agency asked them.\nCaregiver 2 reported not understanding why her son, an adult who\nlives out of state would need to have a clearance to visit the\nchildren in the home. Caregiver 2 denied informing the agency of\nthese concerns, but believed the agency was aware.\nOn 7/15/2025, during a foster home visit, I interviewed Caregiver\n1, who was present with her Grandmother; and at times\nGrandmother chimed into the conversation. I also interviewed\nChild A alone.\n7",
    "Caregiver 1 reported FCW was trying to make it seem to them as\nif Child A did not want to be hugged, but it was that Child A did not\nwant to be hugged by FCW. Caregiver 1 reported when FCW\nvisited her home FCW would insist on speaking with Child A\nupstairs with the door closed. When FCW would not get the\nanswer she wanted, FCW would shake Child A and tell Child A\nthat “you can tell me”. Caregiver 1 did not witness the\naforementioned interactions between FCW and Child A, Child A\ntold them what occurred. Caregiver 1 denied Child A ever telling\nher FCW pushed her or made her fall. Caregiver 1 reported as of\nnow it will be her and Grandmother caring for the children. She\nsaid Caregiver 2, who had cared for the children at night, just\nmoved back to Arizona, and she would be informing the agency of\nthis.\nCaregiver 1 and Grandmother expressed concern that the\nagency did not want the children placed in their home; had\naccused Caregiver 1 of having a fake identification, of her and\nCaregiver 2 not sharing information with the agency related to the\nchildren’s school, or about Child B having wetting accidents at\nschool. Caregiver 1 denied that. She expressed concern that the\nagency was assuming she could not take care of the children\nbecause she is young. She reported being 29 but looking 19. She\nreported FCW’s initial home visits seemed friendly, supportive, but\nthe visits increased. Caregiver 1 said when she complained about\nthe home visits, FCW began to visit the children at school.\nCaregiver 1 and Grandmother also expressed the same concern\nas reported by Caregiver 2 about FCW and FCS stating during a\nmeeting that their children could become involved with children\nservices and get taken. Caregiver 1 reported she does not have\nany children so that did not make sense to her. Caregiver 1\nreported relief that FCW is no longer the children’s foster care\nworker. She said she believed FCW had gotten some information\nChild A had reported about an adult cousin who may have hurt\nher, mixed up with a child by the same name and that FCW was\nnot supportive of the family keeping the children. Caregiver 1\nreported the new foster care worker is “fine”, she does not\npressure the children, and her attitude is different from FCW, more\npositive.\nChild A reported FCW visited the home twice a month when she\nwas first placed with Caregiver 1. FCW later started coming three\nor four times a month, and even came unannounced, randomly\nshowing up for a home visit after 5:00pm. Child A said FCW even\ncame in a van once that said state department and that was scary.\n8",
    "Child A reported FCW would speak with her alone and FCW\nwould ask her questions like “how are you doing?” or “are you\neating?” She said sometimes if she didn’t make eye contact with\nFCW, or FCW did not “understand where I was coming from”,\nFCW would ask her if she was sure about her answers, as though\nshe was lying. She said FCW would pretend to play with her, like\ntouching her shoulder and say, “oh you can tell me, when I was\ntelling her the truth”. She said FCW once told her to “stay in a\nchild’s place”, meaning to act like a kid, while also telling her to\nhelp out with her sister and brother. Child A reported once during\na home visit FCW pushed her shoulder with a little force and she\nfell on the floor and FCW stood over her. Child A said Caregiver 1\ncame over and saw her on the floor. She said FCW did not\napologize to her because FCW said she tripped.\nChild A denied being afraid of FCW or of FCW hurting her. She\nalso denied being hugged by FCW when it was unwanted. When\nI asked her specifically if she was ever touched by FCW when she\ndid not want to be touched, Child A reported “yes”. She reported\nFCW touched her shoulder and that happened more than once.\nChild A admitted FCW may have touched her to comfort her, but\nthen she stated, “it was a kind of madness and was not warm”.\nChild A did not explain what she meant by that statement, but\nstated she does not miss FCW as her worker.\nDocuments Reviewed:\nChild A’s MISACWIS file which showed:\n• Child A and her brother and sister Child B and Child C were\nmade temporary court wards on 2/20/2025.\n• The children were placed in a foster home on 2/20/2025 and\nreplaced with their current relative placements on 4/24/2025.\n• FCW was assigned the children’s case on 2/20/2025.\n• The children initial and updated service plan indicated the\nfollowing:\no The children had been doing well in the foster home;\nwere placed with their current caregiver against the\nagency’s recommendation, but the children and\ncaregiver were adjusting okay. Additionally, there\nwere concerns with the birth mother visiting the\ncaregiver’s home; and with school issues as\nmentioned by the agency staff when interviewed.\no FCW’s “pop up” home visit to the caregiver’s home\nwhen she spoke with the family about concerns and\nspoke with Child A. Child A reported feeling good and\nnot needing FCW’s help any longer because of that,\n9",
    "while also reporting to FCW she had a secret to tell\nFCW which FCW cannot tell anyone.\no FCW’s 5/21/2025 unannounced school visit where\nshe spoke with the three foster children. It noted Child\nA reported she was uncomfortable to see/talk with\nFCW; and FCW denoted that was the first time Child\nA had reported such an action.\no There were no reports of concerns noted in the\nservice plan related to FCW or agency staff.\nAnalysis Based on interviews and documents reviewed there is insufficient\nevidence to substantiate the allegations as described in the\ncomplaint; or to support a lack of responsible character or\nsuitability of the staff to meet the needs of children and families\nserved by the agency. The agency had concerns with Caregiver 1\nand Caregiver 2 and were further assessing the caregivers to\nensure safety in the children’s placement. Conversely Caregiver 1\nand Caregiver 2 had concerns with the agency staff, did not feel\nsupported or trusted and the two parties did not appear to be\nclearly communicating these concerns directly with each other.\nAdditionally, Child A denied unwanted physical contact with FCW\nwith the exception of her shoulder being pushed by FCW; which\nshe reported resulted in her falling and Caregiver 1 was aware of\nthat, but Caregiver 1 denied this.\nConclusion VIOLATION NOT ESTABLISHED.\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\nAugust 1, 2025\nLonia Perry Calloway Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 1, 2025\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
