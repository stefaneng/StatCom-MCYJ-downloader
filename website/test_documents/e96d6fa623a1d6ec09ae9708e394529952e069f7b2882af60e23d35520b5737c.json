    "Concern:\n Wasn’t informed about the children’s background prior to placement. A foster\nchild has behavior issues. The foster parent wasn’t informed of the other child\nbeing a bedwetter.\nResolution:\n The agency reported it shared this information wit the foster parent. A review of\nMISACWIS social work contacts showed documentation of background\ninformation on each child being shared with the foster parent before placement;\nand of medication being shared and what that medication was for, ie. anxiety/\ndepression and incontinence for the child the foster parent reported not being\naware was a bedwetter. The SED and DOC review with the foster parent\ndocuments that behavior and past history information was discussed with the\nfoster parent.\n Social work contacts did not document whether the foster parent was provided\nwith all information required by R400.12417 for Foster parent information,\nsubrule (1)(d), (g).

A\nMISACWIS review by this consultant showed, more than one home visit occurred\nwith the birth parent in her residence, numerous contacts, inclusive of attempts,\nand contacts with the birth parent when the birth parents resided with others.\nThere is no rule noncompliance.\n15",
    "Safety and Concern Alert #5:\nConcern:\n The foster care worker hasn’t conducted any unannounced home visits, as\nrequired with the relative caregivers.\nResolution:\n The agency reported the the foster worker made required unannounced home\nvisits. A MISACWIS review by this consultant showed compliance with\nunannounced home visits to this caregiver’s home.\nConcern:\n The relative caregivers do not have a medical passport for the children that are in\ntheir care.\nResolution:\n The agency had no prior documentaton showing that the relative caregiver\nreceived the medical passport at placement. The agency provided the medical\npassport document to the foster parent on 8/22/18.\nConcern:\n The family has a trampoline with no safety net.\nResolution:\n The foster parent refused to install a safety net because the youth was leaving\nthe home. The agency later reported the foster parent did not want the child\nremoved. The child was remaining in the home and a safety plan was being done\naround supervision and the trampoline. The agency was working with the foster\nparent on purchasing a safety net.\nConcern:\n According to birth parent, she didn’t receive proper referrals according to plan\nthat was developed.(Ex: The referral for their psychological exam was received\nlate, so instead of completing the service in May, it’s just being completed.\nResolution:\n The agency reported the court did not order a psychlogical for the birth parent\nuntil 6/26/18 or 6/28/18 ; the court was delayed in scheduling a dispositional\nhearing on the case until then. A referral for section 8 housing occurred 5/10/18\nand the psychological referral was attempted in late July, but was delayed due\nissues with the provider. The psychological referral was executed on 8/1/18;\nand the birth parents’ psychological assessments occurred 8/16/18. Case\n16",
    "documentation of these reporting was verified by this consultant. Service\nreferrals were completed for the birth parents within appropriate timeframes.\nSafety and Concern Alert #6 and #6a:\nCritical #6:\nConcern:\n Water feature without an alarm/rescue equipment.\nAnalyst observed there was no alarm on the door that leads directly to the pool.\nThey do not have rescue equipment.\nResolution:\n The caregivers installed safety equipment on the pool, and an alarm on the door\nleading to the pool on 8/15/18. The relative caregiver provided photo’s showing\nthe installations.\n Home furnishings aren’t properly maintained. Analyst observed torn screens on\nthe side door and patio door.\nResolution:\n The caregivers completed screen repair of the side door and patio door on\n8/15/18.
