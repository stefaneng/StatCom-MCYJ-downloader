    "period. This special evaluation was reviewed and determined to have been\ncompleted thoroughly and adequately addressed the allegations.\nCorrective Action Plan Compliance\nThe agency has submitted 1 acceptable corrective action plans (CAP) during this\nlicensing period, and compliance with each individual CAP is as follows.\nThe agency submitted one CAP which was in response to the 3/11/2022\nlicensing renewal inspection and was approved on 3/25/22. That CAP addressed\n9 violations, 6 of which were repeated during this inspection. The three areas in\nwhich the agency achieved and maintained CAP compliance were foster parent\nfirst aid & CPR training, foster home licensing recommendations, and adoption\nfile storage. The number of violations increased to 12 this year; however, the\nmajority of those violations were found in 1 or 2 files. The areas with a substantial\nnumber of incidents on violated were related to obtaining PATP signatures and\nfile management. It was noted that the majority of documents reviewed during\nthis inspection were uploaded within 2 weeks of the inspection date. At least 3\nfiles reviewed would have contained very little documentation throughout the\nyear until those documents were uploaded.\nChief Administrator Assessment\nThe chief administrator assessment was reviewed and discussed during the\nentrance conference. The chief administrator accurately identified issues with\nuploading documentation timely as well as obtaining parent signatures on\ndocumentation.\nFinancial Overview\nA financial audit was not required as this licensee is an MDHHS office.\nStaff Interviews\nThe staff interviewed reported receiving support and assistance from their\nsuperiors and peers. Two of the staff interviewed reported a lack of awareness\nthat there are timeframe expectations for uploading documents into the case\nrecord. None of that staff interviewed reported any concerns.\nDescription of Agency Walk Through\nThe agency appears to have sufficient office space and equipment to perform the\nrequired job functions. The case files & CHRI records are stored securely in\ncabinets that lock in a manner that prevents unauthorized access.\nVII. FIELD ANALYST FINDINGS\nNo safety concerns identified.\n9",
    "VIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on inspection findings the agency is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the agency continue on their regular license.\nMarch 3, 2023\n________________________________________\nHolly Austin Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nMarch 3, 2023\n________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n10"
