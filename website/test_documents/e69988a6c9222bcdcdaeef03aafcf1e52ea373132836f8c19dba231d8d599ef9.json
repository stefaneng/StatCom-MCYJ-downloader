    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation A youth escaped from the secure facility.\nInvestigation Complainant was informed of this incident on social media and\ncontacted DCWL staff on 07/05/2023.\nYouth B, Youth C, Youth D, and Youth E were interviewed\nduring an unannounced face-to-face visit at the facility on\n07/07/2023. All of the youth had similar recollections of the course\nof events when Youth A escaped the facility. They recalled the\nunit was outside in the yard playing football when staff had\ninstructed them to go inside, because Youth C was getting upset\nand refusing to follow directives of staff. All of the youth in the unit\nexcept for Youth C proceeded to go back into the building.\nYouth C additionally stated Staff 1 was speaking with him and\nattempting to de-escalate him when he noticed Youth A had come\nback outside from the same door that all the youth had previously\nused to enter back into the building. Youth C stated this only took\na couple of minutes. Youth C stated he did not want to be involved\nin whatever Youth A was up to, so he decided to listen to staff and\ngo back inside the building. Before he went inside, Youth C stated\nhe heard Youth A say something to the effect of “I’m tired of being\nhere” and “I’m not getting no BMT for no reason.” Youth C\nrecalled a female staff attempting to go hands-on with Youth A but\nwas not able to. He could not recall who this staff member was.\nYouth C stated this was the last he saw of Youth A until hearing\nlater that Youth A had escaped the facility. All of the youth were\nasked if they had ever heard Youth A talking about wanting to\nescape or having a plan to escape. Youth C stated he had heard\nYouth A talking about trying to run away some time recently.\nYouth C stated Youth A asked Youth C to go with him and Youth\nA’s plan was to wait until they went outside and then climb the\nfence. Youth C believed Youth E might have heard the same\nthing. Youth C stated that he did not tell anyone else, youth or\nstaff, about these comments.\nYouth E recalled a similar conversation with Youth A. Youth E\nstated same day as the incident, Youth A had asked Youth E to\nattempt to escape with him. This occurred when the unit was\noutside playing football only minutes before Youth A ended up\nattempting his escape. Youth E recalled hearing Youth A talk\nabout how he thought he could climb the fence and then go to a\nclothing store to change outfits and attempt to steal a car at a gas\nstation. Youth E stated he felt like Youth A was serious but stated\n2",
    "that he did not tell anyone because he did not want to get involved\nin any drama.\nYouth B, Youth D, and Youth E all stated similar recollections of\nbeing inside the gym when they saw Youth A run back out. They\nstated that they were instructed to line up against the wall before\nthey were going to change their shoes by Staff 2. Very quickly\nYouth A started to inch toward the door that went back outside\nand then ran through the door. All three-youth stated that these\ndoors are normally locked and the only way to get through them is\nto either be buzzed through from the control room, or from a staff\nwho has a key. All three youth did not know how Youth A was able\nto get outside the door other than it was open.\nStaff 1 was interviewed during an announced, face-to-face visit to\nthe facility on 07/10/2023. Staff 1 recalled Youth C was initially the\nreason the entire unit had to come inside from playing football in\nthe yard. Staff 1 recalled Youth C being upset but could not recall\nwhy. Staff 1 stated before he knew it, Youth A was back out in the\nyard when the rest of the unit was inside. Staff 1 stated he\nproceeded to walk Youth C back inside because Youth C had\nchosen to be cooperative once Youth A went outside. Staff 1\nstated other staff were still out in the yard with Youth A but could\nnot recall exactly who. Staff 1 stated he was able to have Youth C\ngo back to his unit and then he proceeded back out to the yard to\nattempt to help de-escalate Youth A. Staff 1 recalled seeing Youth\nA running around the yard and his emotions would quickly move\nfrom him laughing and happy to frustrated and angry. He could not\nrecall everything Youth A said, but Staff 1 did recall hearing Youth\nA say something to the effect of “she makes me so mad” and Staff\n1 assumed Youth A was referring to Staff 2, the other female staff\nworking with the unit that day. Staff 1 also recalled hearing Youth\nA say, “I miss my mama” as well as saying “they trying to play me\nin court” and “I don’t wanna talk about it no more.” Staff 1 stated\nhe was out in the yard with Staff 3 and Staff 4. They were all\nattempting to manage the environment and talk to Youth A to try\nto de-escalate him and get closer to him. Staff 1 stated he heard\nYouth A escalating more and more as Staff 4 got closer to him.\nStaff 4 then removed himself from the situation and went back\ninside to the gym in an attempt to remove himself as a trigger for\nYouth A. Staff 1 stated he and Staff 3 were within 15 feet or so of\nYouth A at one point when Youth A quickly attempted to scale the\nfence. Staff 1 stated this occurred right at a point where there is a\nlocked gate in the fencing. Staff 1 recalled Youth A was able to\nmake his way up and over the fence well before he or Staff 3 were\nable to get near him. Staff 1 stated he was almost able to touch\n3",
    "Youth A’s foot before he made it over, as a reference to how close\nthe two individuals were. Staff 1 stated he ran back inside the gym\nand through a small hallway and back outside to a small\ncourtyard. Staff 1 stated he did this because he knew there was a\nsecond fence Youth A would need to scale if he was attempting to\nescape. Staff 1 wanted to maintain line of sight even if Youth A\nhad already made it over the fence. Staff 1 stated by the time he\ngot through this pathway to the second fence Youth A, had\nalready scaled the fence and was almost out of his line of sight\nrunning south. Staff 1 stated he ran back inside to get outside to\nthe parking lot. He got in his car and drove to a nearby street in an\nattempt to see if Youth A would run by. Staff 1 stated he did see\nYouth A running in the opposite direction from him and Youth A\nwas starting to run through backyards. Staff 1 stated before he\nwas able to make a move to get closer Youth A disappeared into a\nnearby woods. Staff 1 recalled Staff 3 and Staff 5 met up with him\nat the same spot. Staff 1 recalled further efforts in the neighboring\narea to attempt to find Youth A which were ultimately\nunsuccessful. Staff 1 stated he has never seen a youth even\nattempt to climb the fencing in the yard like Youth A did that day.\nHe stated he believed the fencing on the property was adequate\nconsidering its overall height and the top half of it had much\nsmaller chain-link that was intended to be anti-climb fencing. Staff\n1 did not believe Youth A would attempt to jump the fence during\nhis escalation in the yard because this happens on occasion and\nstaff have always been able to spend the time and eventually de-\nescalate a youth outside and get them inside. Staff 1 also stated\nhe never heard Youth A say that he was going to try to escape or\ntry to scale the fence. Staff 1 recalled confusion as to how Youth A\nwas able to get back outside from the gym. He stated the doors in\nthe facility are all on locking mechanisms and heavy, and staff are\nalso all trained to make sure they visually see a door shut\nbecause of the secure nature of the programming.\nStaff 2 was interviewed during an announced face-to-face visit at\nthe facility on 07/10/2023. Staff 2 recalled the unit was outside\nplaying football and Youth C started to become upset. When\nYouth C refused to come inside, all the staff agreed to have the\nrest of the unit come inside to the gym while staff worked to de-\nescalate Youth C. Staff 2 stated she was the first staff to come\ninside with the youth, including Youth A, no one seemed upset, or\nwas giving her a hard time about coming inside. Staff 2 also\nrecalled Staff 4 eventually coming inside briefly. Staff 2 recalled\nYouth A was not where he was supposed to be on the wall. Staff 2\ninstructed him to move over to where the other youth were sitting\non the wall. Staff 2 stated he started walking that way, and as she\n4",
    "looked to the right, she quickly realized Youth A had taken off and\nran towards the door. Staff 2 stated she did not see how Youth A\nran out the door, but it was obvious he had been able to do so\nimmediately. Since she was the only staff inside the gym, she\nstayed inside to maintain line of sight and supervision of the rest\nof the unit. Staff 2 recalled receiving instruction from Staff 6 that a\nlockdown was going to proceed so she walked the rest of the\nyouth back to the unit. Staff 2 stated she did not see Youth A\nagain and was not involved in any efforts in the yard to try to de-\nescalate him or react to his escape. She stated she did not know\nuntil later he had escaped when many of the staff were\ncommunicating and working out a plan to get outside to try to find\nhim. Staff 2 stated she believed that the door from the gym back\nout to the yard had to have been open or unlocked somehow for\nYouth A to make it back outside so quickly. Staff 2 described her\nexperiences working with Youth A prior to this incident. She stated\nwhen he was mad he would run around and attempt to flip tables\nand sometimes escalate more physically towards youth or staff,\nbut she believed he was usually able to be de-escalated with time\nand attention. She stated she never heard him say anything about\nattempting to run or escape from the facility. She did recall hearing\nhim talk about being excited to go outside to play football that day\nin a manner that was not necessarily normal for him, but that this\nwas not something that she thought anyone would have thought to\nact on in the moment considering that it was a nice day and all of\nthe youth tend to enjoy going outside.\nStaff 3 was interviewed on 07/10/2023 during an announced face-\nto-face visit at the facility. Staff 3 stated he was outside with the\nunit when Youth C started to get upset. Staff 3 stated he turned\nhis attention directly to Youth C and attempted to manage him and\ntry to de-escalate. Staff 4 recalled all of the youth had no problem\ngoing back inside from the yard and he thought that was because\nit was about time to go inside as expected anyway. Staff 3 stated\nhe worked to have all of the other youth go back inside together.\nHe recalled seeing Youth A go inside with the rest of the youth.\nStaff 4 recalled Staff 2 went inside with this group of youth.\nInitially, Staff 1, Staff 3 and Staff 4 were outside with Youth C.\nStaff 3 recalled Staff 4 must have gone to the door or stepped\ninside at some point during this interaction. Staff 3 stated before\nlong the situation changed drastically when he saw Youth A run\noutside from the gym. Staff 3 clarified he did not actually see\nYouth A exit through the gym door back outside, but that he kind\nof “just appeared.” Staff 4 recalled hearing Youth A say “I’m tired\nof this.” Staff 3 thought he heard Youth A refer to being upset with\nStaff 2 in some form but he was not sure what this meant. He did\n5",
    "recall hearing Youth A state “She’s always going off on me.” Staff\n3 stated he and Staff 1 attempted to make contact with Youth A\nbut we’re not able to do so. Staff 3 also recalled during this time\nYouth C had changed his behavior and decided to go back inside\nwith the rest of the unit. Staff 3 stated he and Staff 1 stayed\noutside to keep working with Youth A. He recalled Youth A’s\nattitude going up and down between being mad and laughing.\nStaff 3 recalled during some points Staff 4 and Staff 6 were\noutside as well but they eventually went back inside. Staff 3\nrecalled hearing Youth A say “The only people who try to talk to\nme are you two” but Youth A did not allow them to get close\nenough to him to stop the situation. Staff 3 stated when Youth A\nwas walking towards them and nearing the doorway to go back\ninside to the gym he believed Youth A was giving off mannerisms\nthat he was ready to give in and go inside. Staff 3 recalled seeing\nYouth A quickly scale the fence without saying anything else. Staff\n3 stated he stayed outside to provide line of sight when Staff 1 ran\ninside to attempt to meet Youth A over the fence. Staff 3 stated\nStaff 1 “did not stand a chance” to catch up with Youth A because\nYouth A scaled the first fence and then the second in quick\nsuccession. Staff 3 stated he, Staff 4 and Staff 5 all ran outside\nand got in a car to attempt to follow Youth A. He stated they did\nnot see Youth A when they were outside and they eventually met\nup at a nearby street corner with Staff 1. Staff 3 stated he\neventually went out on foot into the woods and attempted to call\nout for Youth A. Staff 3 could not recall how long he did this for\nuntil supervision radioed for all staff to come inside because law\nenforcement was now looking for Youth A. Staff 4 stated the entire\nlength of time in the yard was about 10 to 15 minutes. He stated\nhe was never within an arm’s length of Youth A during this\ntime. He never believed Youth A was going to attempt to jump the\nfence because it is somewhat common for youth to be escalated\nor upset in the yard, and a common response from them is to\nrefuse to come inside. Staff 3 stated staff are always able to work\nthe situation so that youth end up inside and he has never seen\nanyone attempt to scale this fence. He specifically noted he never\nheard Youth A talk about wanting to run or wanting to escape in all\nhis time working with him. Staff 3 stated he did not feel like there\nwas much that could have been done differently in the situation.\nYouth A was interviewed during an announced face-to-face visit\nto his new placement in jail on 07/25/2023. Youth A stated he had\nbeen placed at the facility prior for about 11 months. He stated\nthat he had been outside playing football with his unit when they\nwere all instructed to go inside because Youth C was\nstruggling. Youth A stated he came back inside to the\n6",
    "gym. When asked, Youth A stated he did not have a concrete\nplan in that very moment that he wanted to try to escape but he\nhad thought about it in the past and believed that he could do\nit. Youth A stated once inside Staff 2 had told him to “Be quiet,\nhold that” and this made him mad. Youth A stated he noticed the\ndoor to the gym was open slightly so ran directly toward it and\nthrough it. He was not sure if Staff 2 saw him or not or who was\non the other side of the door, but he did not believe Staff 4 or\nanyone else was holding it. Youth A recalled once he was outside\nhe saw Youth C with Staff 1, Staff 3 and Staff 4. He stated he was\nthen wandering the yard and making a point not to let any of the\nstaff get near him. Youth A recalled talking to staff, especially\nStaff 1 and Staff 3, but could not recall what he said in any of\nthose moments. Youth A remembered at some point he took off\nhis shoes and his socks. Youth A stated there was not anything\nthat staff did in that moment that caused him to attempt to scale\nthe fence and escape, he just thought he could do it and that was\nthe right time to try. Youth A stated he didn’t think it was as\ndifficult as he previously thought to get up and over the fence\nbecause he was able to get his feet and hands in the seams\nbetween the posts that created the large gate in the\nfencing. Youth A stated he got over the first fence and then\nimmediately scaled the second fence that was about 20 feet\naway. From that point he stated his memory was a bit fuzzy, but\nhe recalled running through backyards and a nearby woods and\nthen a field. Youth A believed he saw Staff 1 and Staff 3 on the\noutside of the facility, but he was not sure if they saw him. Youth\nA stated he was eventually able to get a ride from a stranger and\nmake it back to his mother’s home where he encountered law\nenforcement later in the night and surrendered peacefully. Youth\nA stated he had spoken to other youth, who he refused to name,\nabout the idea of escaping from the facility but that he was\npositive that staff never heard him. He also believed that, even\nthough he was mad at her at the time, Staff 2 was not at fault for\nthe situation because he did not think she knew the door from the\ngym to the yard was still open at all.\nStaff 4 was interviewed with Staff 5 as a support person on\n07/25/2023 during a scheduled meeting at a neutral\nlocation. Staff 4 was not assigned to work with this particular unit\nand was called in to the situation when Youth C began to refuse to\ncome inside. Staff 4 stated he made his way through the gym\noutside to the yard and encountered the youth in the unit and Staff\n1 and Staff 3 outside in the yard. As he went outside Staff 4\nrecalled hearing Staff 2 tell him inside the gym that the staff\noutside needed help. As Staff 4 walked out, he remembered the\n7",
    "door already being open and not locked. Staff 4 stated he held\nthe door ajar just a little from the outside because he believed\nother staff might have been coming out to assist. Staff 4 recalled\nYouth C being escalated and upset. Staff 4 stated Youth A ran\nout of the gym to the yard. Staff 4 recalled turning his attention to\nYouth A, but he did notice Youth C quickly changed his behavior\nand decided to go inside to the gym. Prior to Youth A running\nback out to the yard, Staff 4 recalled also thinking that he had no\nreason to be concerned about Staff 2 being the staff providing\nsupervision to the youth in the gym prior to Youth A running back\nout. Staff 4 stated he joined Staff 1 and Staff 3 in attempting to\ntalk to Youth A, but at some point Youth A stated he did not want\nto talk with Staff 4 if he was outside with them. Staff 4 agreed to\nremove himself and go back inside. He stated this is a common\ntactic to work toward de-escalation with youth in that sometimes\nstaff are a target of their anger and frustration and there always\nshould be enough staff around to swap out. Staff 4 stated the\nyouth from the unit were already getting back to their unit when he\nheard over the radio Youth A had escaped the yard and was\nAWOL. Staff 4 recalled running outside to see if he could spot\nYouth A before he got too far. Staff 4 believed he saw Youth A\nbriefly running away after getting over the second fence and into\nthe parking lot, but Youth A got away from him quickly. He stated\nhe initially went past the back of the assisted living facility that is\nlocated next to the detention center. Staff 4 recalled moving to\nother locations out past the property of the detention to no\navail. At some point Staff 5’s car joined him, and he got in with\nher to come back to the facility. Staff 4 stated he has never seen\nanother youth try to go up the fence at the facility. He also had\nnever heard Youth A say anything of concern that could have led\nanyone to believe he would attempt this. Youth A recalled some\nof the safety precautions that have been trained at the facility,\nincluding going around the fencing when staff first go outside to\ncheck for any breaks and to check that the large gate is locked.\nDHHS Caseworker and DHHS Supervisor were interviewed over\nvideo conference on 08/01/2023. DHHS Caseworker did not\nrecall ever hearing anything of concern from Youth A about\nwanting to or believing that he could escape the facility. She also\nstated she did not have any concerns about the facility in her time\nworking with them during Youth A’s placement.\nStaff 6 was interviewed over the phone on 08/10/2023. She\nstated she was involved in the situation but only over the phone\nwhile on duty at the facility. Staff 6 had heard Youth A had\nrefused to come in from the yard. She stated that she was inside\n8",
    "the facility talking with other staff on what to do to try to address\nYouth A’s behavior when she heard over the radio that Youth A\nescaped. At that point she assisted with a building lockdown.\nThe facility’s Chief Administrator was interviewed over the\nphone on 08/18/2023. She confirmed that an element of staff\ntraining is to teach all staff to check doors behind them while\npassing through them in the secure part of the facility. She\nclarified that some doors are “heavy” and close and then lock on\ntheir own, and some need to be manually locked. This requires\nstaff to check each door that they exit through to ensure it is\nclosed and locked as designed.\nTour observation:\nA tour of where the incident occurred was conducted on\n07/10/2023 during an announced face-to-face visit to the\nfacility. The secure facility has a gymnasium that has two exits to\nthe outside. The north exit was not utilized in this incident, but the\nsouth door was. This south door locks from both sides. Only\ncertain staff have a key to exit the building and anyone else\nutilizing the door need to be buzzed through by the control\nroom. The south door then opens up to the large yard area. The\nentire area is enclosed by fencing that is approximately 20 feet\ntall. The bottom half of the fencing is comprised of normal chain\nlink and the top half is comprised of a much tighter chain link that\ndoes not allow for fingers to grip. This is designed to be anti-climb\nfencing. The only exit in the fencing is a gate that is a few feet\nsouth of the door to the gym that is used for maintenance and\nyard work purposes. This gate is closed with a large padlock that\nwas present during the tour. On the other side of this gate is a\ncourtyard that extends west into other parts of the building and\nsouth to another set of fencing. This set of fencing is of equal\nheight and has an identical gate in it facing south to the parking lot\nand the outside of the secure parts of the facility.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Facility policy titled “AWOL – Prevention and Intervention”\nwas provided and reviewed. This policy was applicable in\nthat it was consistent with the de-escalation efforts of staff\nprior to Youth A’s escape.\n• Facility policy titled “Emergency Procedures: AWOL: (From\nthe Facility)” was provided and reviewed. This policy was\napplicable in that it was consistent with the efforts made by\nstaff to locate Youth A after his escape from the facility.\n• Incident Reports numbered 117795, 117797, 117802,\n117803, 117804, 117806, and 117807 were provided and\n9",
    "reviewed. They were authored by Staff 2, Staff 5, Staff 4,\nStaff 6, Staff 3, and Staff 1 respectively and all dated for\n07/03/2023 on the date of the incident. All of these incident\nreports but one detailed individual staff accounts of the\nincident in question. These reports are consistent with the\ninterviews provided in the investigation. The last incident\nreport authored by Staff 3 details investigative questions\nposed to youth in the unit in the aftermath of the incident,\nand no information is contained that is inconsistent with the\ninterviews in this investigation.\n• Video footage of the gymnasium was provided and\nreviewed. Youth are beginning to come inside the gym\nfrom the south door that exits to the outside yard at 5:15:40\npm. They all line up against the south wall of the gym. At\n5:16:35 pm it can be seen that Staff 2 addresses Youth A\nand points toward the wall. At 5:16:54 pm Youth A can be\nseen quickly running toward the door and exiting through it.\nIt cannot be distinguished from this video footage if the\ndoor was open or not at that point because there is a small\nhallway from the east wall to the door that exits to the yard\nthat obstructs some of the view. No video footage of any\noutside areas was available because there are no cameras\nthat capture that area of the facility.\nAnalysis The facility is found in non-compliance as a youth was able to\nescape the facility when a staff kept an exit door ajar, allowing the\nyouth to exit the building and scale the fence.\nTechnical Assistance\nDuring interviews it was reported staff are trained to check doors\nto ensure they are secure. Facility does not have any written\npolicy/training outlining this requirement. Facility should update\ndocumentation accordingly to ensure doors are secure at all times\nand not remained open if not currently being used.\nIt was discussed with Chief Administrator that appropriate\nalterations could be made to the fencing surrounding the outside\nyard area to reduce the chance of youth attempting or escaping\nfrom the facility again. Different pictures of other court operated\nfacility fencing was provided along with a specific fencing\ncompany.\nConclusion Violation Established\n10",
    "IV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is not in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. Upon receipt of an acceptable corrective action plan, it\nis recommended that the current license status be continued.\n08/18/2023\n_________________________________________________\nTyler Armstrong Date\nLicensing Consultant\nApproved By:\nAugust 21, 2023\n________________________________________________\nJessica VandenHeuvel Date\nArea Manager\n11"
