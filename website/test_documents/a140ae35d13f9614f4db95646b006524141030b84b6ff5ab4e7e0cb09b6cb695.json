Staff\n1 is a staff member at the facility. Last night, Youth A was being\nrestrained because he was trying to leave. Staff 1 grabbed ahold\nof Youth A and Youth A tried to choke Staff 1 and scratch his eye\nout. Staff 1 then flung Youth A across the room and Youth A hit\nthe stool to his desk. Youth A was examined by the nurse in the\nfacility, and he was determined not to have been injured. The\nincident is currently under investigation at the facility.\nInvestigation Administrator 1 was interviewed via phone on 2/18/2025. He\nreported having no further information to provide about the\nincident. He also reported learning about the situation while\nreviewing the video of the restraint of Youth A by Staff 1. He\nreported observing inappropriate techniques by Staff 1 and that\nYouth A also was attacking other staff.\nAdministrator 1 and Administrator 2 were interviewed face-to-\nface at the facility on 2/19/2025. They reported Youth A was\nplaced at the facility on 2/10/25 and is scheduled to be removed\nfrom the facility later today. They also reported not receiving\ninformation on the mental health issues Youth A presented with\nwhen being placed at the facility. This included not receiving\nmedication that Youth A was prescribed at the time of placement.\nThey reported observing the video recording of the restraint and\nfinding that Staff 1 pushed Youth A back into Youth A’s room\nwhich is not a technique used in the approved behavior\nmanagement program.

However, Youth A is reported to have a history of back\nissues from an accident.\nYouth A was interviewed face-to-face at the facility on\n2/19/2025.

Youth A also reported a belief that Staff 1 shoved Youth\nA directly at the stool and Youth A would have been alright if he\nhad not hit the stool. Youth A based this belief on Youth A’s\nperception of the angel Youth A was shoved. Youth A reported\nbeing paralyzed and having no feeling below Youth A’s waist.\nYouth A also reported “begging” for assistance and having staff\nignore Youth A’s request. Youth A was unable to identify the\nnames of the other staff present but believed these staff would go\nalong with whatever Staff 1 reported because Staff 1 was the\nsupervisor at the time and told the staff to just shut the door.\nYouth A also reported having to pull Youth A up by Youth A’s\narms because Youth A could not move his legs. Youth A reported\nthis occurred around 7:00 pm and the nurse did not observe Youth\nA until around 10:00 pm.

Youth\nA also reported urinating on Youth A and had to stay that way until\nthird shift and Staff 2 came into the unit. Youth A reported Staff 2\nprovided a change of clothing and gave Youth A, a rag to wipe off\nYouth A’s legs. Youth A also reported being given a new mattress\nand new blanket at the same time.

Staff 1 and Staff 4 then picked up\nYouth A and moved Youth A to Youth A’s bedroom. Once in the\nroom Staff 1 reported Youth A punched Staff 4. Staff 1 also\nreported all staff left the room except for Staff 4 who was holding\nYouth A on the floor. Staff 1 reported Staff 4 let Youth A go and\nrushed to get out of the room.

Staff 1 also\nreported pushing Youth A was not an approved technique and he\nshould not have taken that action either. Staff 1 reported he\nshould have given Youth A, a few minutes to calm down and not\nmade going to Youth A’s room the primary issue. Staff 1 also\nreported feeling remorseful and plans to avoid this type of action\nin the future.\nStaff 3 was interviewed via phone on 2/24/2025.
