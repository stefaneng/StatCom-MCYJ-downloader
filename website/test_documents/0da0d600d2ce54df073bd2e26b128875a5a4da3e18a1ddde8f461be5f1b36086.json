Youth A\ndescribed several incidents over the previous month where she\nfelt threatened by other youth in the program.

One example occurred when other youth that Youth A\nchose not to name, had made racist comments to her while she\nwas in her bedroom. Youth A stated Supervisor 1 was present,\nand she addressed the other youth. Another example occurred\nwhen there was an escalated incident in the program and Youth A\nwas shoved by Youth B.

She\nrecalled being placed at the facility at the same time as Youth A.\nYouth B did not have any concerns over staff’s attention and\nintervention any time there was any escalation between she and\nYouth A, or any other youth.

    "Administrator and law enforcement were already present and\nstopped the situation.\nDocuments reviewed:\n• Policy & procedures from the facility were reviewed. In the\n“Behavioral Management & Support Plan”, “Staff\nHandbook” and “Resident Handbook” there are no specific\npolicies outlined that state anything other than verbal\nredirection, safety planning, and a points based system of\nbehavior management will be used to address behavior\nconcerns of residents. The facility does not utilize an\napproved restraint model or any physical management of\nyouth.\nAnalysis Through interviews with the youth involved and documentation\nreviewed there was no evidence found that the facility was not\nproviding proper supervision or intervention between the youth\nplaced.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nRule Code Privacy and confidentiality.\nTitle\nRule Code & CCI Rule 400.4130\nSection (1) An institution shall assure resident and parent privacy and\nDescription confidentiality and shall protect residents from\nexploitation.\nViolation Additional Findings of Non-Compliance\nType\nAllegation Youth A's confidentiality was violated when speaking with a\nmental health provider.\nInvestigation During the 03/13/2024 interview with Youth A at the facility, the\nyouth reported she had been on the phone with her therapist\nwhen the consultant arrived.

During this\ninterview she stated the facility had taken on a policy that all\nphone calls for youth were to be supervised. This included family\nand mental health providers.
