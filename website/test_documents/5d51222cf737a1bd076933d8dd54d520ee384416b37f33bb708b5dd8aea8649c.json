    "Violation Potential Rule or Statute Violation\nType\nAllegation Youth A forced Youth B to kiss her and threatened her.\nInvestigation On 7/13/23, I spoke to consultant 1 via telephone. Allegations\nwere reviewed and information concerning the facility was shared.\nOn 7/13/23, I left a voicemail for Complainant 1. Complainant 1\ndid not respond to PC.\nThe following interviews were completed face to face at the\nfacility on 7/14/23:\nSupervisor 1: Supervisor 1 reported the allegations came out\nwhen Youth A accused Youth B of having her (Youth A’s babydoll)\nin her bedroom and wouldn’t return it. Supervisor 1 reported that\nYouth A then told her Youth B kissed her in the bathroom.\nSupervisor 1 reported that Youth A told this to Staff 1 too. Staff 1\ndid complete a 3200 and completed an incident report. Youth A\nwas unable to provide a time frame on when this incident\noccurred. Supervisor 1 reported that the bathrooms in the unit are\nlocked and must be unlocked by staff prior to usage. The doors\nmay stay opened once unlocked while the youth is using the\nrestroom. The bathroom is an open unit with stalls. When the\nyouth is done in the bathroom, the bathroom door is to be locked.\nStaff 1: Staff 1 reported Youth A told her that Youth B forced her\nto kiss her in the doorway of the bathroom. Youth A reported that\nstaff were sitting at the table in the unit. Youth A reported that\nYouth B said, “give me a kiss or I will beat your ass.” Staff 1\nreported that Youth A reported that she had to give Youth B her\nbaby doll or Youth B would lie and say that she (Youth A) kissed\nYouth B. Staff 1 reported that only one youth can be in the\nbathroom at a time. Staff 1 reported that the staff must unlock the\nbathroom door for the youth to use it. Staff 1 reported that staff will\nredirect youth if someone is using the bathroom and another youth\nis at the entranceway of the bathroom. Staff 1 reported that if\nthere are more than 1 youth who need to use the restroom, the\nstaff will stand at the doorway to supervise. Staff 1 reported that is\nwould be out of the ordinary for someone to take Youth A’s baby\ndoll without Youth A saying something due to Youth A usually\nhaving her baby doll with her.\nYouth B: Youth B reported that Youth A gave her the baby doll\nbefore she went to her home visit so that Youth B could take care\nof her. Youth B reported that Youth A even gave her a backpack\nof the babydolls belongings. Youth B reported that a couple weeks\n2",
    "ago Youth A was at the closet and asked her (Youth B) to kiss her\n(Youth A). Youth B reported she did not kiss Youth A. Youth B\nreported that Youth A kissed her on the lips. Youth B reported\nstaff were at the table and did not see her do this. Youth B\nreported she did not kiss Youth A at the bathroom entranceway.\nYouth B reported that staff have to unlock the bathroom door for\nthem to use it. Youth B reported and they usually go 1 by 1 in the\nbathroom. Youth B reported sometimes they prop the bathroom\ndoor and if there are issues in the unit, they keep the door locked.\nYouth A: Youth A reported that Youth B wanted to kiss her. Youth\nA reported that Youth B kissed her at the bathroom entrance.\nYouth A reported that Youth B asked to use the restroom. Staff\nunlocked the door to the bathroom for Youth B. Youth A reported\nthen she went to the bathroom entrance, and they kissed and then\nshe left the entranceway. Youth A reported that staff were in the\nunit at the table. Youth A reported to use the bathroom, the youth\nhave to ask the staff to open the door. Once the youth is in the\ndoor, they can have the bathroom door closed unless there are\nsome issues with the youth to keep the door opened.\nVideo footage was not available for this situation due being given\na specific date for the incident to have occurred. I was able to\nreview when Youth A gave Youth B her babydoll in the video. She\ngave her the babydoll and a bag. There was no visual evidence of\nbullying or forcing.\nI reviewed the incident report written by Staff 1 on 7/13/23.\nYouth A had stated to Staff 1 she had to give her babydoll to\nYouth B because Youth B stated she would “lie on her” and tell\neveryone that Youth A forced her (Youth B) to kiss her.\nI observed the unit. The unit is an open area. The table (where\nstaff are said to be sitting) is next to an open living space, which is\nnext to the entrance to the bathroom. The bathroom entrance is\nvisible when sitting at the table and the living room area. The\nbathroom door was unlocked and opened when I observed the\nunit.\nAnalysis There is no evidence to validate Youth A and Youth B kissed at\nthe bathroom entrance. Youth A reported that she kissed Youth B\nat the bathroom entrance, yet Youth B is stating she was kissed\nby Youth A at the closet. There is no time frame to review and no\nvideo footage to determine incident. There are no specific staff\nnoted by either Youth A or Youth B. Either way, both youth\nreported that staff were sitting at the table in line of sight. Should\n3",
    "additional information become available this investigation will be\nre-opened.\nTechnical Assistance: Technical Assistance was provided\nconcerning the bathroom policy. There were multiple procedures\nlaid out by staff and youth on how the bathroom is supervised\nwhen in usage and whether the door is locked or unlocked when\nnot in use. It would be beneficial for the agency to review their\nwritten policy and ensure the written policy is being practiced by\nstaff.\nConclusion Violation Not Established\nIV. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on investigative findings the facility is in compliance with all applicable\nlicensing statutes and rules. It is recommended that the current license status be\ncontinued.\n8/15/23\n______________________________________\nVenus Decker Date\nChild Welfare Licensing Consultant\nApproved By:\n9/7/23\n________________________________________\nLinda D Tansil Date\nArea Manager\n4"
