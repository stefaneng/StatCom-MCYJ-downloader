The investigation found that while staff-to-youth ratios were technically met, only two staff were on duty instead of the typical three, and they were insufficient to safely control the escalating situation or effectively separate the youths, leading to a prolonged altercation.

The investigation, which included interviews with staff, youths, and a review of video footage, found insufficient evidence to substantiate the choking allegation, concluding instead that the youth was the primary aggressor.

The investigation found that two staff members were present and supervising at the time, but their attention was divided due to concerns about a potential vaping incident and administrative duties. Ultimately, the state concluded the facility was in compliance with staffing rules, as the staff were physically present and had a direct line of sight, and therefore no violation was established. Despite this finding, the report suggests staff supervision was inadequate as they were focused on paperwork and a secondary concern, which allowed the incident to occur unnoticed.",n,5525,145,6784

The investigation found the youth did eventually receive her check by contacting her assigned worker, and the youth later stated she had initially used the wrong contact number for the agency. The report concludes no policy violation was established.

Investigators found the facility had sufficient clothing and proper procedures for both clothing requests and medical access, though documentation and policy clarity needed improvement. Youth A's clothing issue stemmed from a preference for a smaller size than recommended, and her medical care was delayed because she did not follow the correct request procedure, not due to staff refusal.

Several allegations, including inadequate heating, lack of cleaning supplies, verbal abuse, and delayed medical care, were not substantiated. However, the investigation did substantiate three violations: a staff member used a prohibited martial arts chokehold on a youth, the facility operated out of its required staff-to-youth ratio for a period, and staff failed to write incident reports as required by internal policy.

During multiple attempts to restrain the youth, Staff 2 forcefully picked him up and slammed him to the ground, causing the youth pain and requiring a hospital evaluation.

Youth A alleged that Staff 1 placed an elbow on his neck, impeding breathing, but multiple staff witness accounts contradicted this, describing a standard supine restraint.
